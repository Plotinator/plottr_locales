            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie stands up to Pa </Title>
            <Synopsis>Suzie helps supplement the family earnings by gleaning the fields but she secretly hides some of the proceeds. He Pa is furious she didn't bring home enough, and starts to beat on her. This time Suzie stands up for herself and hits him good. He recovers and beats her silly, and take Bee into the bedroom and pounds her sexually. Suzie decides fighting back may not be good.  ***Maybe move this earlier? </Synopsis>
            <Text>The dancing, the drinking, the food. The party had been a great success. I basked in the memory. Somehow, having fun made me feel pretty. At least until I got out of bed and looked into the mirror.
I didn't think I could get any uglier, but at eighteen I was way too tall for a girl, and my hands were as big as a grown man's. I hated my hands, but then one day I took to liking them. Preacher says that God never gives you anything you can't handle, so I figured it was time I used my man-hands for more than work. 
Today was the day. Pa was done with beating me, or Ma, without a fight. I was finished with being a piece of beef pummeled into hamburger. Ma's fear was crippling. I guess it was up to me. 
Pa made me glean the fields after machines had their chance. Late in the afternoon, when it was too hot to pick, I’d be out there picking the scraps by hand. The sun’s heat radiated into my bones, my finger bled, my back stiff. Pa thought he was punishing me, but I loved it. Here, it was quiet. Here I was safe. 
Life had long since left the field; the plants left for dead. Yet, I pulled life from that death. After I was done, it would be plowed under to prepare for next year. Its resurrection—something hopeful about resurrections. 
I loved working the farm. Here I was, my own boss. I felt strong. Here I never worried about Bee. 
It was a good day. I had picked seven bushels. If I could, I would’ve picked into the night. But I knew better than to be late for dinner. I loaded up the bushels but headed in the opposite direction of home. 

"Mr. Perkins," I called out. 
"Suzie. Been pickin’ I see. When’s your daddy gonna learn they got machines for that now? Look at you, girl—you’re a mess." He shook his head as he looked me up and down. 
"Yes, sir, been pickin’. You want to buy a bushel for half what you get for it at the market?"
"Why sure, but if your daddy finds out you’re giving way his cotton, he’ll have both our heads." 
I stood with bushel in hand. "Probably best we not tell him then." 
"What are you gonna do with the money?" 
"Maybe get out of this place someday." 
"Yeah, yeah, and I’m going to be a movie star." Mr. Perkin's chuckle was more lighthearted than usual. "One bushel ain’t going to make me rich, but if it helps you out, okay." He gave me a wink. "I’ll give you half what you’re asking for, that will make up for the risk I’m taking with your Pa." Mr. Perkins reached out for the bushel. 
"Appreciate the offer, but I'll find another buyer." I said. 
"Oh now, don't get all huffy on me. I'll take it." 
I knew he'd take it. We do this dance every week.
I handed him the bushel and waited for him to go into the house and bring back the money. 
Half-mile down the road, I stopped, took off my shoe and put the money in my sock. Couldn’t risk Pa finding it. 
The stench of my skin charred by a mixture of sweat, blood, and dried fertilizer walked into the room before I did. 
"How much?" Pa stammered before the front door even closed. 
"Six bushels." I clenched my man-hand around the doorknob and braced myself––today was the day, I reminded myself. Very few days passed without a beating. Kind of like getting up in the morning, brushing my teeth, milking the cow—and somewhere in there—getting a beating. 
"Six bushels? A damn jack-ass could pick more." He barreled across the kitchen.
Ma peaked around the corner; her damp cheeks glistening with fresh bruises. As Pa pulled back his fist, Ma cowered and disappeared into the bedroom. The sight of her recent bruises heated a volcano inside me. When his fist jabbed my cheek, my head bounced back against the door jamb. It was Ma who wailed from the back room like a hawk protecting her young.
Then my big man-hand flew up from my side, elbow crooked, fist balled, and the volcano within erupted under his chin with a powerful upper-cut snapping his head back so far, he staggered into the table pushing it against the refrigerator. 
He shook his head, stunned maybe, but no more than me. I froze. Ma shrieked and slammed the bedroom door. 
"You god-dammed son-of-a-bitch." With blood in his eyes, his veins pulsed. His fury swirled like a tornado, and I was in its eye. 

I don’t remember much after that.

Later that night, Pa stumbled out of the spare bedroom and into bed with ma. A while later, Bee made her way back to our room. I could feel her tears. 
"Damn girl. One of these days, I swear, I’m going to kill him!" 
The mirror doesn’t lie. He’d pounded her good. The insides of her thighs already showing blue contrasted with the red hand-marks on her arms where he held her down. 
"We gotta learn to fight back," I said. We have to fight back. But thought again as I looked at the battered woman with streaming tears we reflected in the mirror. If that was the result of fighting back, maybe it was better to take the beatings. She look bad. 
Fighting back might kill us. Or him.

            <Notes>Need Cotten Picking info - machine, what people do etc. 
Part of cotton - what is taught husk called. 

This needs to make Suzie really mad enough to want to see her Pa dead — maybe not end on she acquiring to his beatings 

This flow nicely after scene where Ma almost hits Suzie (Pa sneaks out Suzie asks Ma about it) 


Add something about - Mrs. Jones saying he was just a bully  in scene: Mrs. Jones brings books. and maybe how her confronting him in Priest gives sermon - that encourages her to stand up. </Notes>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie presses Aiden for info, refuses his help </Title>
            <Synopsis>Suzie presses Aiden for info on tunnel and evil influence. She has seen him with some of the evil people at his dad's store asking him specifically about the man with the gold truck. Suzie confides in him showing him the threatening note, and tells him Pa is dead and Cartel has Ma and Bee. He tells her about the Chinolas Cartel and what they are doing. Aiden is working for them but is cagey about it (learn later he is working for FBI infiltrating the Cartel). He suggests Suzie go to the FBI. Suzie pushes away his help, and is more determined to find Ma and Bee on her own, and decides to go to the mine to scout it out for herself. 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>When Ma returns, she'll need her money. I replaced both my money-stash and Ma’s back in their original hiding places. I kept her diary close at hand. It was too important, too personal to be lying around even in her secret hiding place. 
Straightening up the house helped me think. The mundane task gave my brain a chance to connect the dots. The drugs and money, that's what the note referred to. Who ever my Pa stole from, wants them back. I focused on a plan. At first, I wanted to move the money and drugs again, but thought better of it. They’ve already searched this place, no reason for them to search it again, at least not right away. 
The sound of Aiden’s car pulling in front of the house distracted me. 
"Suzie, you okay? Was driving by and saw your mailbox bowled over." Aiden opened the front door. "Holy shit, what happened here."
"What are you doing here?" I said. 
"I was worried about you. Who did this?" 
"You shouldn’t be here. You need to go." I didn’t bother to look at him; I continued to clean. 
"Whoa, whoa. Stop a minute." Aiden held my shoulders. "Now, tell me what’s going on."
I glared at him. He was keeping me from what I needed to do. 
"Something is clearly not right. Let me help." Aiden released his grip but stood firm. 
"Who owns the gold truck?" I surprised myself with the question, but once it came out, I realized that truck could lead me to Ma and Bee.
"What? What truck?" Aiden asked. 
"The gold four-door dually that always parks in the first space at your Pa’s store. It’s there every time I am." 
Realization rippled in Aiden's eyes. He turned away. "Well, he’s, you know, a customer." 
"Just a customer. Then why can’t you look at me." I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him around. 
"It’s a guy from the construction crew working on the new casino. That’s all." Aiden looked away again and rubbed his forehead. 
"What else?" I demanded. 
Aiden drew in a breath. With his shoulders straightened, he looked at me again. "Suzie, some things are better left alone. It’s none of our business," Aiden said. 
"They made it my business," I said as I righted each of the kitchen chairs. I pointed to the note on the refrigerator. 
Aiden walked over to the refrigerator and read the note. He pulled it off the door and read it again. Shaking his head, he rubbed his forehead again. 
"What do you have of theirs?" he asked. 
"I don’t have anything of theirs. But Pa might." He didn’t need the details. 
"Where is your Pa, anyway?" 
"Dead." 
"Dead? What do you mean dead?" 
"Dead like in not breathing." I surveyed the can goods, ceral, flour and such strewn across the kitchen floor. 
"Oh, my god." Aiden pressed his fingers to his forehead as if warding off a headache. "How?"
"What does it matter? He’s dead." I re-shelved what food I could salvage.
"So, let me get his straight. Your Pa, who is now dead, stole something from the people who tore up your place. But based on this note, it looks like they don’t know your Pa is dead." 
"That’s about it." I moved to the next room, picking up things on the way. "Suzie, slow down," Aiden pleaded, still holding the note. 
"Okay, I’ll slow down." I marched straight up to him, toe to toe. "Who owns that truck? And what’s going on near the old mill? And don't tell me they're building a casino."
Aiden looked as if he had seen a ghost. "Why would you ask about that?" 
"Because, the road that leads to the old mine, the road nobody had used for decades, is now secured by a new fence at the entrance camouflaged by brush. A road, I shouldn’t know about, that leads to a place where someone might have taken Ma, and won’t let her go until Pa returns their merchandise. That someone might be the owner of that gold truck." I spit each word louder than the one before it. Each with increasing intensity. 
 "You don’t know what you’re talking about. You don't mess with these people." Aiden responded in kind.
"Well, college boy, they’re already messing with me." I pointed to the note in his hand. 
Aiden's crinkled his brow. "You have something of theirs?" he said, staring at the note. 
"You won't find it in that note. I told you, I do not know what they’re talking about. But I will get Ma and Bee back safe."
"Wait? You think they have your Ma?" 
"Yea, and Bee." 
"Whatever." Aiden rolled his eyes. "And your Pa stole from them?" 
I wanted to slap him for dismissing Bee like that. "Whatever? You learn that in college too? That’s how you treat your girlfriend?" 
He closed his eyes as he shook his head. "Let’s stay focused here. What makes you think they have your Ma?" 
"Who else are they threating to kill. Now, are you going to help me or not?" I felt the blood rushing to my face. If Bee had asked, he’d help.
"Help you do what?" 
"Tell me about the man in the gold truck and what's happening at the old mine." 
"You can’t go against these people." 
"What’s the problem? You said they were a construction crew?" The sarcasm dripped from every word. 
"Suzie, let’s call the authorities." 
"Authorities? You see the way the cops handle things around here. Pa paid off Police and the Social Worker to keep me out of school, folks steal at will in front of the Deputy, and where were they when Father John was killed? Suicide, my ass. Or when Father Joe and several of the town's men went missing. And I’m sure as hell not letting Ma and Bee disappear into oblivion like that." 
Aiden shook his head. 
"There are no authorities anymore. Don’t you get it." I slapped my palm on the end table. 
"I get it more than you realize," said Aiden. "I wasn’t talking about the local police. The FBI." 
"FBI? Yea, right––I’ve got them on speed dial."
"Suzie, please. Sit down and listen," Aiden said.
 I put the books on the bookshelf. 
"I'm serious, Suzie, sit. I can help you." 
Aiden took my arm and guided me into a chair; he sat in the one next to it. I waited for him to talk. 
"That construction crew? They are building more than a casino. They are building a tunnel." He stopped and looked at me. 
"A tunnel? To where? For what?" 
He took my hand. "It’s the Chinolas Cartel."
"The CC13?" Images from the news of full-bodied tatooed men, each branded with CC13 on their foreheads, cheeks or eyelids invaded my senses.  Stories of the of the most notorious and powerful drug cartel in the world, responsible for fire-bombing of tourists, hanging of men in the square, displaying heads on stick in front of police stations, and the raping and torturing women for sport, not to mention flooding America with opioids, cocaine, and fentanyl echoed in my head. 
"Things are coming together." 
"What things?" Aiden looked confused.
"Never mind. The tunnel?" 
"The tunnel goes from Jackson, near the old Copper mine, across the border to Agua de Vida."
"That’s specific. How do you know all this?" I locked eyes with Aiden, who glanced away. "You’re working for them?" 
"It’s not what you think, but kind of, yes." 
I stood up so fast the chair flipped to the floor. "So the biggest, most violent drug cartel is building a drug mule superhighway, and you’re helping them. Is that what you’re saying?" 
Aiden grabbed my hand. "It’s not like that––" 
"Jesus Christ, my Pa stole from the CC13––," My sudden realization shook me. "Brilliant." I pulled my hand away. I felt Aiden's eyes drinking in my every move. Good thing I hadn’t mentioned the drugs and money. 
"So, they're expanding their territory from Nogales to Jackson?" I asked. 
"Not so much expanding, they’ve been entrenched for a while. Think about it. After the Smelter closed in '87, hundreds of jobs disappeared. The Jackson economy tanked––wait, what? Your Pa stole from the cartel? That's what this note is about?" 
I raised my eyebrows, cocking my head. "What does the old Smelter have to do with anything?" 
Aiden whipped his face with his hand. "A perfect storm formed as the economy crashed, the crop prices plummeted, and the real estate bubble burst. The cartel seized the moment, filling the void. On one hand, they pumped money into roads and infrastructure, gave our farmers and out-of-work Smelter workers' jobs––albeit illegal jobs. While on the other hand, they poisoned our neighbors, heck, our country with drugs. 
"So they’ve been here for a while, they're just more visible now with the work on the tunnel." 
The information sunk in. "Ok then. That gives me a place to start." 
"A place to start? Hold up." Aiden’s volume increased. "These animals cut off heads just to make a point." 
"And you work for them. If the Cartel doesn't get their stuff back—Ma and Bee will be the ones hanging from a bridge."
"But Suzie…" 
"And even if they get their stuff back, they will kill us anyway. So, yeah, I’m going after them. What have I got to lose?" 
"Damn it, Suzie," Aiden tried to pull me in close. 
"It’s time for you to go." I pushed him away.
"Stop. Just stop." 
I held the door open. "Leave. Now." 
"I’m on your side. I can help––" I slammed the door behind him. "If you’ll let me." Aiden’s muffled voice seeped through the door. 
He wasn’t even down the driveway before I was back to my planning. At least now I knew who I was up against. First thing was to find out more about that land, how to get in and out, where the mine entrance was, what this casino was all about, and anything else I could use. Mrs. Jones had taken me to the County Recorder's office once. I’d start there. Then I’d venture out to the old mine and see for myself what was going on. </Text>

Her plan starts to come together. It's clear now that Aiden has infiltrated the Cartel for the FBI, but isn't sharing everything with them.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>I drove the ATV straight to Aiden's. I rode around to the back alley to park the ATV next to the stand-alone garage, but was surprised to see Mrs. Jones's car. The main house was dark, but light seeped from the rim of the garage door. What was she doing here so at 5 a.m.? What was she doing here at all? 
The garage had been converted to a workroom for Aiden's mom. Jeb added some windows for natural light, a window air conditioner, and a fan. The floor was still cement but the walls were covered in cork where she hung scissors, spools of yarn, glue guns and other craft tools and materials. On the garage door side, stood a large open cabinet that stored sheets of printed paper, stickers, and boxes of old photos for scrapbooking. Towards the end Jeb moved-in a day-bed which she used to take frequent naps.
Peeking into the window, I saw it hadn't changed much. They hadn't even removed the craft stuff. It sat there as a sad reminder of the fun-loving woman, Joan Manwell was. 
Aiden and Mrs. Jones sat at a long table in the middle of the garage. It was covered with computer print outs, ledgers, a calculator, and a laptop that I recognized was Mrs. Jones. At one end of the table lay the canvas bag and brief case Aiden had at the motorhome. The bag was open revealing cash inside, small wrapped bundles like I found in the babies' graves. The briefcase was also open, but appeared to be empty. 
"This is great work, Aiden," said Mrs. Jones while taking pictures of some printouts. 
I couldn't believe my ears, Mrs. Jones was in on it too.
"Wrap it up, I've got to get these to the store before the boss man arrives," said Aiden.
"So based on what you've uncovered, the bookstore, the bowling alley and the dry cleaners are also indebted to the Cartel. Which corroborates what I'm seeing in their books," said Mrs. Jones. "They are laundering hundreds of thousands of dollars each month, in each business. Amazing." 
"Yep, I agree," said Aiden, who placed the papers back into the brief case and closed the lid. He took out a pen and appeared to mark several of the bills in the bag. "We can't tell the Feds all this yet. If they move in on the store owners, the Cartel might panic and go underground, or worse..." 
"You really think they have her?" Mrs. Jones shook her head. We can't hold it forever." Mrs. Jones leaned over and watched him mark the bills. "Doesn't look like much." 
"Nothing at all, that's the point, but under the right light we can identify these exact bills."
I smiled remembering the marked bill experiment Mrs. Jones had me do.
"You worried about a mole?" asked Mrs. Jones. 
"I know there is a mole. But if the store owners get caught with marked bills, maybe then we can try and flip them. Right now, we don't have enough," said Aiden. 
So they want to pull more store owners into Aiden's money laundering web. But now I knew something their Cartel bosses didn't. I now had leverage.

Aiden also tells the Cartel that the FBI is raiding the store but times it such that the FBI gets there first, so that the Cartel thinks the FBI got their money (which Suzie stole).

With the signal set, he drove to the University. Two hours later, Mark Delacroix rushed out of the University library yelling into his cell phone. "Now, raid the dry cleaners now. No, don't wait for me. Do it now." He raced down I-19 back to Jackson. 
An hour later, Aiden called Mo. 
"Mo, the FBI is getting ready to raid the dry cleaners," Aiden said. 
"What the hell? You said they didn't know about the dry cleaners." 
"They didn't, something else is going on but I'm not in the loop. Something about a source in your inner circle," said Aiden. 
"Shit." Mo clicked off.

            <Synopsis>(SUNDAY) Priest gives sermon about an evil in the town (later learn its the Cartel). The Cartel has a heated discussion with him after the mass, (in later scene he is found dead). Jo and Suzie walk home together. David asks Bobby to help him on the farm tomorrow morning. </Synopsis>
            <Text>The church bell rang and farmers packed into St. Joseph’s Catholic Church. Sweat adorned each man’s shirt, and women dabbed their faces with once white rags. The smell of desperation oozed from the farmers, bitterness seeped from the wives’, and anxiety rocked the pews, fueled by little legs swinging back and forth providing the bored children something to do. 
Overhead fans swirled at a dirge-like pace. The drought had long since taken its toll on the fields and now ate away the very fiber of the community. Each week, more farms collapsed, farmers took any job with a paycheck, and many hung on by their toenails. Shadowy outsiders offered vague jobs with real money. Illegals, who farmers once relied on during picking season, were now met with hostile land, and an even more hostile welcome as ex-farmers saw them as competition for every job. 
Church no longer a place for salvation, but a respite from the devastation that reigned over the land. The service dragged on slower than usual; the stifling heat sucked the life out of the joyous hymns meant to bring a sense of peace and solace to us sinners. 	"Evil lurks in our midst." Father John began his sermon. "Foreigners come and corrupt our good men, and poison the well for future generations. We cannot succumb to temptation." Father John was so laser-focused on the men in the back of the church, that most everyone turned to look at them as well. The men stood there like sentries at the exit doors. 
Ma always called Father John a pleasant optimist, but today his hands trembled, his voice vibrated with anger, and his usual calm demeanor rebelled. The farmers sniped glances at each other; mothers held their kids closer. 
"Times are hard, no doubt. But we must have faith in God and not be tempted by the lure of fast money." He paused and scanned the pews. His eyes stopped at each man who, in turn, averted their eyes. "We must stand united against these foreigners, protect the sovereignty of your land, and do not allow evil to take hold." 	A nervous hush bubbled up; the men at the back stood straighter. Unsure what he meant, I figured it had something to do with the construction down at the old mine. No one would talk about it, but more and more men were signing on with their crew. Some, never came home. 
My eyes grew heavy, but when Father raised his voice and slammed his fist onto the pulpit, it jolted me to attention. 
"Who here will stand with me against this heresy, against this abomination that seeks to corrupt our men, steal our children’s future, and co-opt our land for evil?" He eyed the parishioners. "Who among you will support your fellow farmers and stand as a sign of your commitment to God, your community, and your families?" 
Murmurs rose, and the pews creaked as folks scanned the reactions of their neighbors. A few farmers stood. Uncle Bobby, who sat in front of us, turned, looked at pa and cocked his head. Other men turned to glance at the men in the back. Did one of them just give a slight nod? Sure enough, more men rose, then the remaining men rose, including pa and Bobby. 
Father’s hubris erupted. "Good, good. We fight this evil!" He sat on his thrown-like chair on the side of the alter with a satisfied smile. 
The usher stood at the end of the pew, waiting for the collection basket to make its way across the row. No matter how bad things were, most folk put money in the basket. Margaret Carter placed her dollar bill in the basket and passed it on to me. Dropping my quarter in, there it was––the dollar bill with the three stars I put on it. I couldn't believe it. Wide-eyed, I glared at Mrs. Carter. 
"What's wrong with you, girl?" Mrs. Carter cocked her head. "It's just a dollar." 
I closed my mouth and passed the basket to Ma. I couldn't wait to tell Mrs. Jones.
 
After mass, the parishioners lined up to tell Father John how nice the service was; it was the polite thing to do, my Ma said, even if the service was boring. I jockeyed to be the last in line. 
"Father John," I said, shaking his hand. "What happens to the collection money? I'm mean, where does it go from here?" 
"Well," he said, lowing his chin and raising his eyebrows as if deciding if I planned on stealing it. "Joan will count it, record it, bundle it, and drop it in the overnight box at the bank. Can't have little hoodlums trying to steal it now, can we?" 
"Yes, sir, thank you." I quickly followed the others.
Outside, we stepped into our weekly ritual of socializing after mass where we celebrated or commiserated, or both. The womenfolk set up a table with watered-down punch, cookies and brownies. What it lacked in quantity, it made up for in taste. A lovely day despite the gloom and doom sermon, and the fact that rain would have been more beautiful than anything. 
The men gathered around a withered Palo Verde tree that did little to shade them from the mid-morning sun. The women congregated on the west side of the building, catching the last of the morning shade. 
I stood with the women while Bee lingered outside the circle. She didn’t much like crowds of cackling women. She avoided curious glances of busybodies wagering on her pregnancy status and who the daddy might be. 
"Can you believe this, almost August and no rain?" said Dot. If Dot didn’t discuss the weather, she gossiped.
"And this heat. My god," replied Joan as she fanned herself with a folded piece of paper. 
"My, my, he was in good form today." Margaret glanced over to Father John. 
Ma leaned in and whispered, "Don’t Father John know about the priest before him?" The other women lowered their eyes or looked away. 
"Apparently not," said Margaret. 
I glanced back to see Father John talking with a group of men just across the field. Their Michael Jordan sneakers and gold watches screamed: not farmers. Father John’s arms waived like one of those blow-up advertisements wiggling in the wind; his face chicken-comb red. 
"Who are those men, Ma?" 
"Stop gawking." She grabbed my arm and yanked me forward.
"Look, there goes Conchita Romero." Margaret whispered so low I had to strain to hear her. "Her husband took off. They haven’t seen him for weeks now." 
I had gone to school with the Romero’s daughter, Maricela. They were good people. I couldn’t believe her pa abandoned them. 
The women watched in silence as Conchita and her kids, Angel and Maricela, got into their car and drove off. 
"Do you think it was ICE?" Margaret asked. 
Most shrugged their shoulders. 
"He is not the only one missing. Who's next?" whispered shy Beth Pillar. 
With furtive glances, Dot changed the topic. Dot, who always knew everything about everybody, shared the news that Andrea felt much better after that awful summer cold. Dot swore her aloe-vera fruit concoction had cured her. I’ve had her aloe-vera concoction, and there wasn’t much fruit in it, but did contain a lot of Tequila. She said anything from a Blue Agave plant produced miracles. When one drank Tequila, according to Dot, one experienced the "healing hand of God himself." 
I wanted to burst out laughing. Some women turned their head, others lowered theirs, and the rest pretended to wipe sweat from their upper lip, concealing their smiles with their tissues. What better justification for getting drunk most days than to claim it was the ‘healing hand of God’. She was a drunk, no doubt, but she didn’t get mean, like pa, she just talked a lot. Then again, she talked a lot when sober too.
Despite that, she was a good neighbor. She had a garden that produced like rabbits, and she never failed to share when others were down on their luck. So, we all played polite like, nodded in agreement, and stifled our laughter. Her heart, beat from the right place.
"Let’s go you two," pa yelled from across the field. Ma and me said our goodbyes, and we rushed to catch up with him.
As we passed Bobby, pa stopped. "Hey, meet me at the lower forty tomorrow? Tractor’s acting up," he said to Bobby. 
"Sure thing, David. God knows, you sure ain’t no mechanic." Bobby fake punched him, one-two, in the stomach. Bobby was often mistaken for pa’s brother rather than his brother-in-law. 
"Yea, but at least I can read and write," pa walked away. 
"Pa?" I took advantage of his good mood. "Bee and me, we going to walk home." 
Ma glared at me when I mentioned Bee. Pa stopped, gritted his teeth. Ma caught his eye and motioned towards Father John, who was in ear-shot. Pa’s eyes darted from Father John back to me. Pa never wanted anything to do with Bee. I doubt he even acknowledged her when he banged her. 
"Do what you want," he grunted. "Don't be late for supper."
I touched ma’s arm. "Don’t worry, ma, we’ll be home in time to help with supper." Pa’s good mood boded well for ma; she’d be safe for a while. 
"I know dear," ma smiled and patted my back. "Have fun."</Text>

</Synopsis>
            <Text>That evening I luxuriating in what a great day it had been. In the rare moment I felt happy, I re-lived the day Aiden and I spent in the abandoned hunting shack, replaying the scene in my head. It always started out so nice. 
The smell of his skin, the taste of his rough tongue, and the gentle touch of his hands. It was a year before the rains stopped. The store was slow, crops were picked; thus, things had slowed to a regular pace. Aiden and I walked, holding hands in the desert warmth of fall, not going anywhere or following any path. We talked and talked. It was the last time I had considered the future. 
An hour into our walk, we happened upon a shack three miles off the highway. Its sun-rotted wood, tin roof, and broken windows ached for company, to which we obliged.
"Shade sure is nice," Aiden said as he pounded on an old couch, causing a flurry of dust everywhere. 
"Nice." I coughed, waving my hands in front of my face to clear some breathable air. "My pa has mentioned this place before. Hunters used to use it a lot." 
"My lady," he extended his arm towards the couch, pretending to be a knight or something.
I rolled my eyes and sat. Aiden settled next to me with his arm around me. It had taken me months not to pull away from his touch, but now, if I closed my eyes for a second and took a deep breath, I could settle into it. In one smooth motion, he shifted, leaned in, and kissed me for the first time. His teeth didn’t slam against mine; his tongue didn’t choke me. I wondered if kissing was supposed to be this way––warm, soft, gentle. I found myself participating. Again and again. 
Another shift and before I realized it, he had slipped my body under his, laying now on the couch. A wave of fear crashed over me. I looked for Bee, but the panic resolved into a calm puddle. I had no urge to fight or to get out from under. A serenity flourished each moment I was with him. Now that we were alone, it blossomed. My guard thawed to a mix of comfort and an odd flipping in my stomach. Vulnerable but relaxed, he encased me in a sanctuary formed by his body, his kisses and, above all, his gentleness.
But once the scene started to replay in my head, I couldn't stop it after the good part. 
When the kissing ebbed, I laid next to him with my head in the crook of his shoulder, snug between him and the back of the couch. His hand moved ever-so-soft, ever-so-light, up and down by arm. 	Sure I was dreaming, Aiden’s voice woke me. "You know? In the fall," he said, sounding as though he had started in the middle of his thought, "I'm off to Sierra Vista for community college. I can’t believe it." His glossy eyes fixated on the ceiling while his hand caressed me. "I’ll be the first in my family to go to college. Imagine that." His head moved side to side. 
The cracked window that first beckoned us to enter, now stood as an omen to giddy girls who dreamt of sanctuaries and let down their guard in the arms of a man––they are fools who deserve what they get. 
Sadness pierced me. The pain, not like being beaten, but not unlike it either. Then, with no other provocation, my anger simmered from within, causing my tears to flow with earnest. How did I let this happen? I know better? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. 
My body, once snug, now felt trapped. I shifted and pushed until freed, sitting beside him now, apart. 
"No, no, no." Aiden, now alert. "What’s this?" He leaned in and cupped my face in his hands. "Sierra Vista is only 45 minutes away. And I still need to help my dad, so I’ll be home all the time. This is No. Big. Deal." 
I pulled away. "Yeah. Sure. I get it." His betrayal, bitter on my tongue. Bee lurked nearby; she knows she should have been here, not me. Bee could handle this. This would never happen to me again. I stood and paced. 
Aiden rose, he started to say something but the sounds of a truck screeching to a stop caused both to whip our heads towards the door. 
"Who’s that? Who else even––" 
The door slammed open with a fury that matched a Javelina protecting her young. It bounced off the inside wall, and back at Aiden’s dad standing in the door frame, holding a shotgun. 
His pa was as mad as a rabid dog. He grabbed each of us by an ear, pulled us to his truck, and tossed us in the back. He was a wild man driving to my house. When we got there, he yanked me out of the truck bed by my jeans and chucked me through the front door. 
I laughed, remembering the scene. It wasn’t funny then, though. No doubt he wanted to kill pa. He had him up against the wall so fast, pa was all — what the hell? Jeb, nose to nose with Pa, screaming how nobody from this family would steal from him ever again, and how his daughter was no better than her thieving, home-wrecking father. 
I had no idea what Jeb was talking about, but it gave me a good reason to stay away from Aiden. Bee handled him after that.

            <Synopsis>S assists FBI in finding the bodies in the field 
Angel convinces her to go to the funeral. </Synopsis>
            <Text>With the tunnels shut down, and the investigation of the Casino construction in the works, Agent Delacroix gathered teams of agents, forensic personnel, cadaver and drug dogs, and ground penetrating radar. 
The suffocating heat of another day exacerbated the already high expectations. Word had gotten out. Town’s folk lined the edges of the field, held back by State Police. 
Experience had shown that the cartel buried money they couldn't launder fast enough. But families looking on with expectant faces did come for the stashes of money, but for the hope of bringing their loved ones’ home. 
Eleven bodies in total. On one hand, the families of seven of those men exhaled relief; their husbands, brothers, or sons hadn't abandoned them. But on the other hand, grief overwhelmed them. They’d never see them alive again. 
I stood with the families. We watched as FBI forensic teams lifted body after body from the ground, placed them in black bags and carried them away. Muffled sounds of tears punctuated with wails of grief accompanied each find. With no more hope, their anger, hardened by time, melted into desperate mourning. 

It took days for the identities to be confirmed by dental records. Angel walked out of the hospital as I arrived to take Aiden home. Jeb had another day. 
"Angel. Your dad. I'm so sorry," I said. 
"At least now we can bury him," said Angel. "But you, you've lost the most. Your Pa, your Ma, Bobby. You know the families are getting together and having a mass funeral for the seven men from town, and your family, right?" Angel said. 
"I heard," I said.
"Someone donated the cemetery plots. Will you be there?" said Angel. 
"I don't know..." I said. 
"You have to be. If not for you, they’d be digging up more dead men. Mom, Maricela and I couldn’t bury my dad, none of us could. You've gotta be there." </Text>
            <Notes>Suzie uses the money her Ma had saved to give her a proper Catholic mass and funeral. She disavowed her Pa which resulted in him being buried an unmarked paupers grave. The whole town shows up for Ma's service, and gathers afterward with food and stories. Jacob is provided leave for the funeral. Aiden welcomes by Suzie closeness to him, but is still cautious with her. News comes out the Casino plan is quashed, but a manufacturing plant is going in instead - offering lots of legal jobs. Starts to rain, better time are on the way. </Notes>

            <Text>Aiden fought with the nurse, insisting on walking out of the hospital on his own, but she was having none of that, placing the wheelchair to block the door. 
"Okay, lets get you in the truck," I said, pushing Aiden to the curb with my one good arm. 
Aiden stopped the wheelchair. "It will be good to have time alone, we need to talk." 
Before I responded, Jo jumped out of the truck. 
"Aiden!" She kissed him and hugged him gently. "Just like you to wait until things calm down at the store to come home." 
We all chuckled. "Good to see you too, Sis."
Jo chattered all the way home. "... and you know, for a while there, our store was FBI central. It was crazy. You can't believe the town. It was all a buzz. The bakery is making plans to reopen, the boutique too. Oh yeah, wait until you see the cards and gifts for you and Pa. And food, god, you've never seen so much food." She finally took a breath. "The funeral is tomorrow," she said in a thoughtful tone. 
"Damn-it. Did we send flowers? Do anything for the families?" said Aiden. 
"Don't worry about it, it's been taken care of," I said.
"Really? Who?" 
"A mysterious town benefactor. It's all like something out of the movies." Jo parked the truck in front of their house. 
"Let's get you comfortable," I said. 
"Jo, we need a minute." Aiden motioned for her to leave. 
"Oh, okay. Sure." 
I opened my door. 
"Suzie, please stay," Aiden said. 
I left the door open but turned back to him. "You need your rest." 
"You're avoiding me." 
 Thunderous silence roiled between us. 
"What's going on? Ever since I found you in the desert, you can't look me in the eye. Did I do or say something wrong? What?"
Quiet tears wet my cheeks. 
"I'm worried about you," he said.
I looked at the open door. 
"And don't tell me I'm only worried about Bee," Aiden continued. 
"Bee's gone." My voice barely audible even to me. 
"What?" 
"I said, Bee's gone. She was never here, I guess." 
"Oh, Suzie," Aiden moved over and put his arm around me. 
"Convinced the Cartel had her, my stubbornness almost got us all killed—but she always protected me. How could I live without her? But I recognize now I can. She’s a part of me, always will be. Just not separate from me." Crying, I jumped out of the truck and ran. 
"Suzie!" Aiden chased me. 
I tripped. Lying on the ground, I sobbed. 
Aiden sat next to me and rubbed my back. 
"It's you I love. Always has been. It was never Bee." 
"Yes, it was always Bee. She's part of me, the part I refused to accept. The part that dealt with things to difficult for me to handle. The part that's going to take me a long time to understand and embrace."</Text>

            <Synopsis>FBI goes to shack to find body and Cartel 
Catch cartel men 
Suzie is there to witness it </Synopsis>
            <Text>A female caller provided an anonymous tip regarding a cartel murder victim. She provided a specific time and place, and promised the FBI would catch the cartel moving the body. 
Delacroix listened to the call three times. There wasn’t time to search for corroboration before acting, but his gut told him this was the same person who had provided the documents. 
He briefed four seasoned agents and provided tactile backup from State Police. He warned them it could be a trap, a hoax, or the real deal. 
“Valenzuela, you're in charge,” ordered Delacroix.
Delacroix wondered which it was. "Watch your six, boys. I promised your wives you'd be home for dinner." 

Valenzuela lead the team to the shack. Stealth and surprise were their primary weapons, along with an arsenal strapped to to their bodies. They surround the building but kept their distance.
"We need eyes and ears in there," said Valenzuela. 
An agent nodded and crept up to the shack. Through a cracked window he secured a small camera and microphone. Valenzuela watched through his cell phone. 
"Bloody shirt, but no body," said Valenzuela, "living or dead. The agent at the window retreated. The men outside on high alert. It took four minutes, and he was back with his team. Valenzuela scrutinized the image to detect even this slightest of movement. 
"Everyone pull back. Now we wait," said Valenzuela. 
"Agent-one here, gold truck heading your way," said the agent stationed at the top of the road. "Odd, though. He's driving like an old lady trying not to scratch the truck, rather than an underworld criminal trying to collect a body."
"I got him," interrupted agent-two. "Senior cartel member. ID confirmed. That's Mo, El Brutal's second. He's got three others with him." 
"Roger that," replied Valenzuela. 
"Boss? We got another one. A woman on an ATV." She's parallel to the road, winding her way to you. You should pick her up now, agent-two, I've lost sight." 
"Negative, she's not in sight," said agent-two. 
"She has to be," said agent-one.
"Negative." 
"Gold truck is parking," reported agent-three.
Valenzuela watched as a Hispanic man got out of the truck and headed towards the house. His head was on a swivel, his gait hesitant. 
He made it to the front door, and within seconds announced, "All clear." 
Mo and the others got out of the truck. Mo inspected the side of his truck before trotting to the shack. 
"Okay then, nothing here. Figure out how we get into the crawl space." Valenzuela heard through his earpiece patched into the planted microphone.
"Boss, a woman is approaching from the rear, but keeping her distance." 
"Who the hell is she?" Valenzuela said. 
"Unknown, sir." 
"Shit. Keep focused on the shack. Four, keep me updated on the girl." 
"Here," said one of Mo's men. 
The sound of wood chaffing and rusted hinges filled the ear pieces. 
"Let's go," said someone sounding like Mo.
"What are we looking?" said one of Mo's men. 
"Money, and lots of it, and if any of it's missing, it's on you. Now go." 
"Money?" Valenzuela said into the comms.
Through the cracks in the shack's skirt, the agents saw shadows of men on their bellies searching the crawl space. Infrared confirmed four men.
"There it is," said another of Mo's men. 
"Move in," announced Valenzuela. Each man pulled on his gas masks. 
Valenzuela and other agents charged the front door and had the hatch to the crawl space covered in seconds. Another rushed in through the back. Four other agents ripped the skirt from the crawl space and rolled a tear gas bomb toward the cartel men.
Within minutes, the agents dragged out Mo and his men, along with a body wrapped in a carpet. The agents cuffed the men.
"We'll be out in no time, big man," Mo’s spouted to Valenzuela. "You need the head of the snake and you'll never get him." 
"Stop, FBI. Raise your hands." Agent-four yelled to a woman approaching the body.
"What the hell?" Valenzuela spun around. 
"That's my mother," the woman said, falling to her knees in front of the carpet. "They killed her."
"You again?" scouled Mo said. "You're dead."  
She turned to Mo. "Not before that snake's head is on a platter."

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Priest's suicide</Title>
            <Synopsis>Priest body is found naked in the desert and deemed a suicide. At his funeral, outsiders stand guard with guns as if to warn the townsfolk to stay in line. (MOVE AFTER PA STEAL FROM CARTEL Scene). 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Catholic Priest's Naked Body Found––Suicide Suspected. The headline loomed across every paper, a week after Father John’s fire and brimstone sermon. Hikers found his corpse on the California side of the Colorado River. His naked body was caught amongst a clump of fallen trees and debris—so the article reported. Took a while for the news to travel back to the Arizona side.
For a while after, we did without a priest. We still congregated each Sunday, and mostly we talked about Father John. No one, including me, believed the suicide story. After all, who commits suicide naked? Conspiracy theories ran wild, like they do in the absences of facts. Farmers prone to conspiracies, said ICE, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, killed Father John, because he provided sanctuary to illegals who poured in from Mexico. Others said farmer Cane Murphy did it, an illegal had raped his daughter, and he too wasn't in favor of the Father John's protection. 
But any farmer could be guilty. Illegals had trashed their farms, threatened their children, or snuck into their homes to rummage for food and money. Over the last decade, most farmers grew to loath them. But when farmers couldn’t hire enough pickers in time to get the crops out before they rotted, the illegals were their savior. But no one spoke of that. 
Still others blamed Father John’s death on the illegals. Although Father John did take-in illegals, he couldn’t take them all in. So the theory was the illegals that he turned away, killed him for it. 
And then there were the conspiracies around the new construction crew, and that they were this "foreign invasion" Father John preached about before he died. The construction crew coincided with the influx of drugs that ravaged our community, which aligned with Father John’s concern about the children’s future. 

The Catholic diocese sent down a temporary priest, Father Ralph, to preside over the Father John’s funeral service and help until a permanent replacement could be found. Only thing, Father John was already a temporary replacement for the priest before him, Father Joe who left without any word. Any priest might conclude an assignment to the Jackson Parish was not a good career move.
Father Ralph said he’d officiate over Father John’s funeral, but only unofficially because suicide was a mortal sin. He didn’t wear any robes, or even his collar, but he prayed with us. There was a good turnout for Father John’s funeral. Too good. The men who'd argued with Father John after his last mass apparently brought friends who felt inclined to exercise their right to open carry which only stoked the conspiracy fire. 
"What are they doing here?" Bobby said, tilting his head towards the uninvited guests. 
"Insurance." 
Bobby crinkled his face as if he didn’t understand, believing the Mexicans had killed the priest.
"You slow? If you didn’t get the first warning," pa glanced at the grave, "then you better get the second." He patted his hip, darting his eyes towards the men. 
"Ah-ha. Subtle." Bobby shook his head as if he understood, but I wondered who, exactly, was giving this 'message.'

            <Text>Turned out, an ATV rode way easier than driving a tractor. I left my truck down the block from Aiden's and rode the three-wheeler home. I headed out to the barn where Pa kept his hunting gear. I gathered up his backpack and loaded it with his night vision binoculars, some flares, extra ammo, and his hunting knife. In the kitchen, I made a peanut butter sandwich and tossed it and a bottle of water into the backpack. From his bedroom, I grabbed Pa’s hunting rifle with his day/night ATN X-Sight scope. I caressed the scope remembering how much it meant to Pa, but caught myself––the combined cost of the scope and the night vision binoculars had cost more than the combined total of everything he had ever given to Ma and me. Often we didn't have enough money for groceries, but he always had money for beer and hunting gear. She deserved more. I had to find her. I shook off the memory and went back to the house.
My cell rang. 
"Hello?" 
The voice on the other end sounded demonic. "Time’s running out. Return what’s mine, or someone dies." The call ended. 
I stood there, frozen. Dread rooted in my every breath. I dropped the cell and ran to each room in the house, then barn, even checked the field. Still no Bee. 

With heightened urgency, I started out about 2:00 a.m. Only three more hours of darkness, with first light around 5:00 a.m. 
 Donned in my helmet, I revved-up the ATV. Queazy with fear, I had tossed and turned all night. Every sound, every house-settling thump caused me to jump up and see if it was Bee. I had rationalized away what I knew to be true: the Cartel had Bee. I had to Ma and Bee before, as the caller so clearly stated, 'someone dies'.
A new moon, and my dark pants and jacket provided me stealth-like cover. The roar of the bike did not. I drove, slow and steady, on the edge of the cleared service road, trying to keep the dust down and the noise to a minimum. 
I stopped to review my notes from when I reviewed the maps of the area. The construction permit showed the new Casino site just up ahead. I pulled over and hid the bike in a thicket of low hanging Palo Verde trees, chocked with mistletoe. The rest of the way was on foot. 
 The darkness comforted me. The sound of machinery told me I was close. I slowed my pace, became more deliberate in my steps. The camp came into sight. The foundation of a building, approximately 70,000 square feet, loomed in silence waiting for the workers to build it into the Casino that I'd seen in the County Recorder's office.
So the construction for the Casino was real. But no one was working tonight. However, Pa and Bobby worked every night, and only at night. I watched and waited, but the construction site lay dormant. To the north, a flicker of light caught my eye. 
I skirted the west side of the Casino site, creeping toward the North end. Another camp appeared, hidden by a slight drop in elevation. I saw people milling about. Crouched down like a catcher, the hunting rifle with the attached ATN X-Sight lay at my side. //Todo/find name of scope From my backpack, I pulled out the binoculars, the peanut butter sandwich, and my water, laying them on top of the backpack. I slid the hunting knife, safe in its sheath, into my boot. 
I hunkered down in the brush, prickers scratched my thighs, rocks dug into my stomach. My elbows burrowed into the dirt as they held my shoulders and head up as I peered though the binoculars. 
I scouted the area to get an overview. This camp was set up in a square. On the north side a large, black polished, shiny motorhome, with pop-outs and a patio, something a rock star might travel in, loomed over the camp. Behind it protruded a wooden roof of another building, the size of a small bedroom. 
The west side of the site housed a sturdy metal shed large enough to hold three cars with an attached awning of equal square foot projecting from the front, toward the inside of the square. Opposite the main building on the south side, a covered area led into the construction site. Another smaller, 3-sided metal framed building, sat on the east side, butted up against a hill which completed the rectangle. Its front door faced the center of the square where a few men were working. Equipment, big and small, dotted the area. From excavators and tractors, to welding equipment, small cement mixers, and hand tools. Scattered everywhere were planks of wood, sheets and rods of steel, and garbage. 
Five trucks were parked in front of some port-a-johns, and another two near the fancy motorhome, one of which was the gold Ford dually. I was in the right place. 
The door of the motorhome opened. A man stood in the doorway talking to someone inside. When he turned to exit the building, Aiden's face came into focus.
So, he did work for the Cartel, I kept him in my site. My face felt flush, my hands trembled, but eased when I realized he could know where Ma and Bee were.
Aiden carried a canvas bag and a suit case to his truck and drove off. My muscles twitched. That confirmed it. Aiden was corrupt. He drove off, I wanted to follow him, to confront him, but glancing back at the camp, I decided to stay. I'd find out what Aiden was doing another way. 	A man walked into view and started up his truck. Four others followed him and jumped into the back of a black pickup. I backtracked their path to the entrance of the covered area leading to the construction site. A herd of men trudged out, way to many for the area under cover. Their dragging feet were pulled along by slumped shoulders and lowered heads.
I adjusted the binoculars to zoom in on the motor home. As I focused on the front door, it flung open and a man stared right at me. I jumped and banged the binoculars against the bridge of my nose. My heart pounded. Had they seen me? 
Deep breath. Calm down. 
He couldn't have seen me. 
Sloth-like, I raised the binoculars into place. The man stood at the bottom of the stairs. A white cloth apron tied at his waist, covering his thighs. He headed toward the building behind the motorhome with, what appeared to be, a tray of food in his hands. 
A flicker of movement behind the east side shed caught my eye. From my southeast vantage, I had a clear view of the back of that building. I focused the binoculars. With his back towards me, he poked his head out, sneaking peaks at the motorhome’s front door. The irony of me spying on a man spying, didn't escape me. Who was this? 	He whipped around and slammed his back against the rear wall of the shed.
I scanned to the front door of the motorhome to see what had spooked him. Gold-man stood on the porch holding open the door as a southern gentleman might do for a lady. Another man, older, more dignified, less blinged-out than Gold-man, walked out and down the steps. Gold-man followed like an obedient dog. Dignified-man walked over to the patio area and stood next to a table and chairs, while Gold-man’s eyes hunted within the flock of men.
I swept back to hiding-man. With his back still against the wall, I got a good look at his face. 
I gasped. 
Impossible. 
I dialed in the focus-wheel again. I alternated between the looking at him through the binoculars and with my naked eye. 
It was Pa.
My heart raced. Consecutive waves of relief, sadness, and anger crashed over me. I lowered the binoculars and tried to clear my eyes. It must be the shadows, the night vision distorting things, the late night, something. With the binoculars back in place, he looked in my direction, almost as if he had heard me. No doubt, Pa was alive. I watched him as he disappeared into the darkness surrounding the perimeter of the site. 
A ruckus broke out in the camp. Gold-man had found his quarry and moved in, yanked his prey out from the crowd, and slammed him down in front of Dignified-man. 
I watched the confrontation unfold, distraught by the thought of Pa being alive. I zoomed in as much as the binoculars allowed. Gold-man stood nearby guarding Dignified-man, not from the prey dropped at his feet, but from the potential danger in front of Dignified-man, specifically the pack of men, now stopped in their tracks, glaring at Gold-man. 
I focused back on Dignified-man; his face contorted, spit flying as he spoke. Looking back to the gang of workers, their blank faces came alive, they leaned and whispered to each other, heads shook, feet shuffled, but all for naught. They cowered within their pack like caged mice. 
I panned over to the worker-man being berated. I twisted the focus wheel in, once again denying who I saw. 
Bobby. 
Dignified-man looking more like a ruthless drug lord now, held a gun under Bobby’s chin while holding him close with his fist wrapped tight into his shirt. A stain appeared on Bobby’s crotch causing Gold-man to break out in a deep, evil laugh I heard from here. Without notice, Dignified-man whipped the hand holding the gun, out from under Bobby’s chin, and back to his right, clipping Gold-man’s jaw, and just as quick, back under Bobby’s chin. 
I heard my heart beat. My eyes widened to take it all in. 
A few more words were spewed, and Dignified-man gun-whipped Bobby across the face, then shoved him to the ground. Dignified-man ejected the chambered bullet from the gun, and tossed it onto Bobby, and walked back to the motorhome door. Gold-man, still rubbing his jaw, sucked air, but rushed to keep up with Dignified-man, and closed the door behind them. 
With the 'don’t-mess-with-me' message received, the mice, masquerading as men, scampered into their trucks and peeled out of camp. 
I swept to Bobby, still on the ground. Minutes seemed like an hour before he moved. With the help of a chair, he got to his feet and stumbled to his truck. His truck mates had abandoned him.
I slumped flat on the ground and rolled over, trying to absorb all that I had seen. I had more questions than answers. 
A twig snapped nearby. My senses heightened. My ears to pierce the darkness. I didn’t move. The sound edged closer. Adrenaline pushed a snake-like shudder through my body. 
With the backpack in one hand and binoculars in the other, I jumped to my feet and ran. 
A shot rang out. I kept running. The darkness, the fear, the gunshot disoriented me. But I fled, until I tripped and rolled into a shallow ravine. I quickly snugged under the brush in a fetal position, shifting a tumble week in front of the brush. Another gun shot rang out. Foot steps approached, and stopped. I held my breath.
"Probably just a Javelina," said a man.
"Yeah," said another man. 
They didn’t move. I couldn’t move. 
"Let’s get back. Whatever it was, it’s gone." 
"Yeah. Let’s not report this. Coming back empty-handed, well, let’s not mention it." 
"Roger that." 
I hid in the ravine long after I heard the last of their footsteps. A quick glance at my watch signaled less than 30 minutes before first light. 
My throat tightened; my stomach flipped. Barely able to breath, I peaked out from under the brush without a sound. The stillness of early morning announced that danger, for the moment at least, had passed. I got up and jogged to the ATV, glancing over my shoulder every chance possible. //timeline/same time line as 'Bobby 2nd Cartel encounter' Bobby 2nd Cartel encounter

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Store scene</Title>
            <Synopsis>**Four weeks after after birth, Suzie and Ma go to Jebs store. Suzie is confronted with hostility from Jeb the store owner, the community is faced with hostility from Cartel and from illegal crossing from Mexico into their ranches and farms (demonstrated by the new on the TV in the store. Suzie is approached by Aiden, an old beau from high school but Suzie tells herself he is there for Bee. 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>	Two months passed, and Bee was healed, physically at least. Life with pa resumed, including late-night visits and regular beatings. Things were back to normal. 
Ma and I headed into town for groceries. Even more shops on main street had withered away like our crops. The Corner Store owned by Jeb Manwell thrived even though a new Walmart had opened a seven months ago. Along with TV’s and clothes, it had a sprawling grocery store, three times the size of Jeb’s. He lowered his prices just before the opening, but The Corner Store couldn’t compete. But ma insisted we shop here. Supporting our own, she said, that’s what mattered. More likely we shopped here for the same reason all the other farmers shopped here, because Jeb extended credit to farmers until after the harvest. 
When we walked in, Jeb smiled and nodded to ma. He ignored me as usual, and never acknowledged Bee. He went out of his way to be kind to Ma, but my very existence––irritated him. 
The TV on the wall behind the cash register blared "Breaking News." Local Jackson police, during a normal traffic stop on 10th Street, fifteen blocks from here, seized a semi-truck carrying over 1000 pounds of Marijuana. Not really 'Breaking News' around these parts. Jackson shared the Mexico border with Agua de vida, Mexico, just steps away for many ranches. Over the last two years, Bill Derks had seen 46 trucks drive through his cattle ranch after they cut a wide birth in the fence between the two nations. One night a while back, one truck broke down, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot in the middle of the night. Bill’s told the story so many times about how he stood watch all night on the porch with his shotgun to make sure the driver didn’t have any thought of paying him a visit. Later, authorities seized the truck, and that one too, filled with Marijuana.
"Despite the 1000 pound Marijuana bust, the DEA reports that highly profitable drugs such as opioids and Fentynal are on the rise."
Jeb eyed me like scum. He switched the channel. "Mind your own business, girl." 
"Hey, turn that back," shouted Deputy Collins who had been glued to the news. 
I started to sass back, but Mrs. Jones appeared from behind the snack counter and grabbed my arm. 
“My goodness, girl. A few weeks of rest did you good. Did you get taller?” Mrs. Jones said, whisking me away from Jeb.
Folks always have to tell me how tall I am, as if I didn't know. But I didn’t mind it from her. Even after she moved away, she stayed in touch with me, pushing me to learn stuff. 
"She bothering you, Caroline?" Jeb said. 
"Shush, Jeb. This lovely young woman?" She waved him off. 
"Watching the news, ain’t a crime," I said loud enough for Jeb’s ears.
Jeb mumbled something under his breath as he unloaded the cans of Campbell’s Tomato soup. He kept one eye on me, always did. Didn’t matter, he never caught me lifting, which I only did when things got desperate––and never when ma was here. However, when a can of beans, a potato or two, or a loaf of bread magically appeared in our kitchen, she never asked, I never told. 
The other customers either looked right past me, or they’d look me directly in my eyes, huff and turn away. Couldn’t blame them. Most of the time, like today, I’d come straight from the field and imagine I didn’t smell too pretty.
"In other local news, the charges were dropped agains El Brutal //todo/need full name, the alleged Drug Lord over Agua de vida territory, after the three women, who had accused him of rape, were found dead, hanging from three different bridges. 
"DEA Agent Ralph Lorenzo states that there was not enough evidence to pursue the charges. In addition, the womens' apparent suicides suggested that the accusations were brought in retaliation for them being fired earlier in the year. The shame of that resulted in their suicides." 
Margaret Carter's booming voice echoed throughout the store. "Genevieve, you got another rose? Persistent, that's for sure." 
"Who do you think it is?" said Dot, slipping a bottle of Tequila into her basket. 
"Hush. Knowing might spoil the fun," said Genevieve. "I hope it never stops." 
The wives' cackle reached the husbands over by the guns and ammunition. They glanced over to the gaggle, and immediately back to the TV news, but it wasn't news to them. They had first-hand experience with the illegals crossing. Years ago, back when things were good, Mr. Darling, like many farmers and ranchers, offered them work. Most of them accepted. Mexicans worked hard, harder than most, and farmers needed the help. But the last few years, it's been less like people fleeing a bad situation looking for a better life, and more like a swarm of deadly bees wanting to cause havoc and chaos. 
"Susan, did you read those books I dropped off last week?" Mrs. Jones always called me Susan, even though that was my mother’s name. She reached to give me a hug. I pulled back.
"Well, only one." I hated when time slipped away without reading. But taking care of the Bee, helping ma, and salvaging our pitiful crop––kept Pa off my back.
"How's things at home, honey?" Mrs. Jones said as she pulled me out of Jeb’s ear shot. 
"Fine." 
"Let me see." She lifted my chin with the middle knuckle of her finger. Turned my face from side to side while she inspected. Then she reached out for my hands, pushed up my sleeves and examined each arm. "You got matching bruises on those legs? Don't lie to me, I'll look for myself." 
Ma busied herself near the corn basket. 
I pulled down my sleeves and lowered my head. "Yes, ma'am,” I said. Her attention bewildered me. 
She lifted my chin again. "You don't ever have to lower your face to me," her voice grew louder, "or to anyone else for that matter." She looked straight at Jeb. 
I didn’t need to see his face, I could feel Jeb’s blood pressure rising. She always said things like that to me, though I was never sure what she meant. 
"Yes, ma'am." I said, knowing that’s what she wanted to hear.
"Your ma told me you birthed a calf last week. All by yourself and just weeks after the––well, you know." 
"More like pulled it out," I said with my head high now. "Betty didn't want to give her up. Some of those bruises on my legs I got the normal way. That calf is paying for these groceries. Mr. Perkins bought her," I said, proud that I negotiated a better deal than pa thought possible. But he'd never know it. I stored away the extra to give to ma. Seemed like pa never gave her enough for food, but always complained there wasn't enough to eat. 
"You wrestled a birthing cafe and kept the mamma down? My girl, you’re strong enough for anything." 
"Like Father John says, the meek shall inherit..." My voice trailed off, embarrassed I sounded so hoity-toity. 
"Well, Jesus said it first," she chuckled, "and you girl, you are not meek. You are strong, pretty and smart." She bobbed her head. 
She must've been talking to Bee. Covered in salty, sun-dried sweat, I sure wasn't pretty. My aching arms, burning feet, and back spasms––remnants of the day in the field––didn't make me feel strong. And still stuck in this town at 18 years old––proof positive I wasn’t so smart.
Mrs. Jones jerked away from me and grabbed the arm of a young man tucking a six pack of beer under his shirt. 
"Jeb," she yelled. Her slight five-foot two inch frame dragged a red-headed hulk of a young man to the front of the store, "this man is stealing from you." She revealed the beer. 
The man showed no fear. He even smirked at Mrs. Jones and gave Jeb a full-teeth smile. 
I had never seen Jeb at a loss for words before. Mrs. Jones stood faced Jeb with that "Well?" look, and his eye ping-ponged between her and the would-be thief.
"Jeb?"
"Eh, yeah, okay, I got this. Thanks, Caroline, I'll take it from here." Jeb walked around the counter, and with one hand under the man's elbow, and one holding the beer, escorted him to the back room.
"Caroline," Bill Derks whispered. "You shouldn't have done that." He walked out the front door. 
"Are you just going to watch TV or do your job, Deputy Collins?" Caroline turned to see the other men staring at her. 
"Looks like Jeb has it handled. Never you mind, Caroline," said Deputy Collins, his eyes didn't leave the TV. 
Bob Perkins whispered,"That boy has powerful friends." He brushed passed Caroline leaving the store." Several of the other men grabbed their wives and followed him out. 
With her hands on her hips, Caroline shook her head.
"Hey, Suzie." Aiden, Jeb’s son, emerged from the stock room. The mood in the store shifted as if nothing had happened. “Great to see you. I've been meaning to call.” 
I jump at the sound of his voice but quickly recovered, "Hey, Aiden." His warm eyes and inviting smile told me he had been talking to Bee, not me. Blushing, I lowered my head. Boys preferred her to me, and I preferred it that way too. I had no interest in boys; hell, I didn’t want anything to do with pretty much anybody. Bee'd smile her coy smile that made boys think she liked ‘em. Not sure if she really did, but hoped, one day, she’d have the sense to kick every last one of them in the nuts, especially pa. 
Aiden looked like he swallowed a bowl full of sweets, and before he could catch his breath, Jeb yelled, "Aiden, help get Mrs. Carter’s groceries to her car." 
Aiden smiled. "We should catch up. And be sure to tell Jacob I said hello," he said, trotting over to Mrs. Carter. 
Folks around town hadn’t yet forgotten about Jacob. Most said to say hi, as if we talked to him every day. I wasn’t sure what to tell them about my brother. Not word from him since he left for the Army, but also no word from the Army either. That’s all I needed to believe he was safe. 
I watched Aiden as he helped Mrs. Carter with her bags; I envied his comfort around people, his ease at talking with them, his deftness at fitting in. Loyalty in his face, but betrayal in his actions. I knew. I’ve known him all my life, and over the decades as I vanished into the background, he stood out. Many wondered why he'd even come back here after graduating college. Potential, they said. If kids got out, they didn't come back. I wouldn’t.
Mrs. Jones was grinning at me. 
"What? I got something on my face?" 
She winked and said, "Not a bad catch, eh?"
 
Ma and me paid for our two cases of Bud, three pounds of hamburger on special because the sold-by-date had passed, two loaves of bread, and a five-pound bag of brown potatoes. First time we'd ever bought potatoes, but the drought had caused a lot of firsts. 
As we drove off, the would-be-thief hopped into a brand new Ford F-150 Rapture decked out like it was on the center display at a car show. He had two six packs of beer now, and placed them on the front seat before driving off.

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
       by Forename Surname
Chapter One
     Standard manuscript format is often required for novels
so that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors
to estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages
will be required to produce a book using the page size, style
and font used by their house. This PDF file was generated
using Scrivener's Compile feature and was created using the
"Novel" project template.
     Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate
title page. The author's name, address, telephone number and
e-mail address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the
title page, single-spaced. The title of the story should
appear in all-caps about half-way down the page. The author's
name follows the title on the by-line as the author wants it
to appear when published. A real name or pseudonym may be used
and may include initials, actual given name or professional
Surname / TITLE / 1
designation.
     All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with
a ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about
five spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional
blank line. (It used to be traditional to separate each
sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors
this is now less common.) A 12-point font such as Courier,
Times New Roman or Arial should be used throughout. In
Scrivener, however, you can write using any font and
formatting you choose--the options in Compile can be used to
change the formatting in the compiled document. In the "Novel"
project template, the Compile settings will deal with changing
the font and formatting to those required for standard
manuscript format.
     Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header
comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work
(or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page
number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled for you by the
"Manuscript" Compile formats.
                               #
     Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do
not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by
Surname / TITLE / 2
the typesetter. The "Separators" pane of Scrivener's Compile
sheet can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
Compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave
empty lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash
character during Compile) or use different documents for
different sections (and Scrivener will add the hash between
them).
     Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be
indicated by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener,
this conversion can be handled by Compile. The "Manuscript
(Courier)" Compile format will convert italics to underlines,
whereas the "Manuscript (Times)" format will not.
Surname / TITLE / 3
Chapter Two
     Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the Compile settings.
In Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
"Manuscript" compile formats.
     Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number
of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will
happily accept a word processor word count these days. In
Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by
using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you
may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in
which case select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded
To Nearest 100--this feature is used on the title page of this
manuscript, in fact).
Surname / TITLE / 4
     Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but
a tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export.
In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only
really crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first
time novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and
agents are often less picky about format and will point you in
the right direction before submitting your work to a
publisher.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Ma doesn't return</Title>
            <Synopsis>Ma and Bobby leave with Pa's body. Suzie fears that Ma has nothing good to return to, so probably won't. Suzie obsessively cleans, denying anything is wrong. *** Add Suzie thinking about how much she loves her Ma? They prepare for picnic Ma had promised, but never go. Next morning, she plows the field trying to be normal. At midnight Bobby comes to "pick up" Pa but drives off without him. </Synopsis>
            <Text>The porch screen slammed when Ma left. Bee and I watched from the kitchen, afraid to get to close. The front doorway glowed from the rising sun seeping through the fine holes of the screen. Ma tossed our shovel into the truck, her hand covering the letter B in circle burned into the handle. B for Bannon. 
The silhouette of Pa slumped against the window framed the passenger side, Ma slid into the driver’s seat. She drove down the road with Uncle Bobby’s truck right behind. 
A dark stain blotched the front yard. I turned away. Eventually, I got up and moved the dishes to the sink. Bee followed. I washed, she dried. We sneaked looks at the front door. 
With the dishes done, we stood by the sink.
We both looked at the front door again. I wondered what she was thinking.
Bee moved to the closet, brung out a mop and started mopping the floor. 
Bee glanced toward the front door, then continued mopping. 
I shrugged and started to leave, but stopped before stepping out of the kitchen. It wasn't mopping day, but we mopped. Underneath the table and chair, even around the icebox, and in back of the pantry--anything not to have to leave the kitchen. 
When the mopping was done, we got on all fours and dried the floor with a towel. We even took an icepick to the corners and scraped off old grease coated in dried crumbs and bug bits. Floor never been this clean. 
This time we looked toward the front door together. 
This time there was no doubt, we were thinking the same. 
"Don’t you worry, Bee, Ma will be back." I tried to calm her down. She held Jacob's ring in her hand. He had given it to her the day he left. Said it would protect us. "Should we let Jacob know about Pa?" I considered it but decided against it. With or without Pa, Jacob was better off without us. 
The sun high in the sky, we needed a distraction. "Let’s go on that picnic Ma talked about."
We made our way out the back door and headed to the chicken coop. The cackling got louder the closer we got. We grabbed the basket at the gate and headed in. 
"Let’s gather any eggs first, then pick us a chicken to fry up."
We were getting less than half the eggs we used to get back before the rain stopped. 
"Which one you thinking?" I asked. None of them looked too good, all of them looked scrawny and tired. The drought and relentless heat had taken its toll on everything.
"Okay, this one. Not much meat on these bones, but we’d be putting it out of its misery." 
Stretching her neck across the tree stump, I raised the ax.
"Sorry little guy." 
Smack. 
The body jerked loose, and tried to deny the inevitable, but eventually succumbed. 
We plucked, cleaned and chopped the chicken into chicken part. Mixed the batter, heated the oil in a big pot, and using a wire basket, lowered in the chicken parts. The oil spit and crackled, then settled into a soft bubbling, turning the chicken golden brown.
Once we were done with everything, packed and ready to go, Ma still wasn’t home and neither of us could leave the house without her. 

Evening crept in. Bee disappeared as she always does when sexual threats are at bay. Her alone time she calls it. Fried chicken sat on the kitchen table. The once crispy skin, now slack; the fat congealed.

For a flash when the first raze of the sun hit our window, everything seemed normal. Until it didn't. I opened my eyes and kicked off the tangled bedsheet. A dark quietness permeated the house. Ma was still gone. I screamed until I couldn’t breathe. I threw a glass of water against the wall, took a deep breath, and marched into the kitchen. 
The day-old fried chicken, our celebration picnic, greeted me from the table. I smashed it into the garbage. Tears flowed as I thought of Ma, Pa, and my brother, Jacob. To hell with all of them. I didn't need anybody.
Routine. Routine was good. So the ritual of the morning chores began, I fed the chickens, gathered a few eggs, milked Betty, and mucked the barn, moving through each task, on a mission to return to normalcy. 
While in the barn, Misery caught my eye. Misery, Pa’s take on the outdated nickname coined for the Minneapolis-Moline tractors, with their MM logo emblazoned on the front. Farmers coined their own meaning for MM tagging it Modern Misery for the tractor’s unreliability. Although our tractor was a John Deere, Pa named it "Misery" anyway. He said that’s farming––pure misery. 
With the tractor in my sights, I remembered Pa had wanted me to plow under the back 40 acres––with his strength and experience it was less than a two-day job for him, but near five for me. No sense putting it off. Besides, keeping Bee busy would keep her mind off things. 
I filled old Misery with gasoline and oil. Grandpa had purchased the 1967 John Deere 3020 during the 1980 farm auctions. It still ran, but barely. Its notorious finickiness with cold starts wasn't a concern in the middle of the Arizona summer. With the throttle set and the choke positioned, I cranked the ignition. She coughed and sputtered but didn’t turn over. Two more times, and she gave in. With the four-foot wide span of the three bottom plow, I expected to cover eight acres. But Misery didn’t agree.
The once fertile ground, starved of rain, cracked and crusted like five-day-old pudding brought Misery to its knees at least once a furlough. I’d be lucky to plow four acres, but only if she held up. By the time she calmed down and found her rhythm, the blistering heat of the sun reminded farmers everywhere that Mother Nature controlled the day. She made life easy, or not. And as of late, not. 

The old tractor barely made it into the barn. She groaned while hissing steam erupted from the engine. I’d check with Bobby to see if he could work his magic, but then I noticed the rear tire. Dry rot; it was shot. No wonder Misery dragged. Even if Bobby fixed her, I couldn’t afford a tire. I suspected ol’ Misery had seen the last of her productive days. Sputtered steam prolonging Misery’s inevitable death.
I brushed off the dirt of the day while walking to the house. Once inside, the emptiness of the house screamed out. No mater how much routine I relied on, I wasn't in control and I didn't know who was. 
I stood, I sat, I paced, gasping for air. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. But it wasn't. Pa, Ma, and Jacob all gone. Even Bee had taken a hiatus as she does when Pa's not around. Chaos swirled around me. 
My panic exploded into a desperate desire to visit the graves of the babies in a vain attempt to feel connected. I ran the 150 yards to the backyard. Pa had buried the three babies under a Mesquite tree. Two girls, one boy. No names, no headstones like I’d seen on graves where we had laid Gramma to rest; just a small, homemade, wooden cross Ma had placed here after the first baby died. I guess if you don’t have a wake, where everybody looks at you, you don’t get a gravestone. 
The holes were different shapes and sizes. The last two bigger than expected, but then again, I had never dug a grave. 
Chaos took over my brain and my stomach. Overcome with despair, I dug into the graves. My fingers bled from the hard soil littered with cactus needles and prickers. Nausea rose as I got closer to unearthing them, but I couldn't stop myself. 
My fingers scratched on something. More digging unearthed an raged shoe box large enough for mens cowboy boots. I cradled the box and rocked, smiling for what could have been, and wept for what was. 
My breathing started to slow, the impending doom took a step back. As I reached out to put the box back into the ground, I noted the weight of the box. Too heavy for a stillborn. I shook it lightly. Solid. 
With care, I lifted the lid. I don’t know what I expected to see for a dead baby, but it sure wasn’t this. I flipped the lid onto the ground, and couldn’t believe my eyes. 
Money. 
The dead baby’s coffin-box was packed with cash. Neat packets of strapped $100 bills. I’d never seen so much moola. 
"What the…?" I started digging up the second grave, and then the third. 

Covered in dust, I glared at three boxes filled with bundles of cash. 
"Where are the babies?" I surveying the area around me, expecting to see them lying somewhere. Instead, three more grave-like mounds beckoned from under a nearby Palo Verde tree. I scrambled over to them and started digging. 
This time the grave-like holes stored white bricks of powder wrapped in clear plastic. Ten in total. 
Bewildered, I dropped to the desert floor. On one side lay packets of money, and on the other, plastic wrap bricks of white powder. I looked down at my body; a thin layer of silt stuck to me like powdered sugar on a sweater. In my hair, on my skin, and up my nose. I had seen this before. I glanced between the drugs and the money.
So this is what Pa had strapped to him after his mysterious late-night ventures. Though an ingenious hiding place, you'd have to be sick to use the graves of dead babies to hide drugs and money. My moment of grief over his death, vanished. 
An instinct, strong as a mother lioness protecting her cubs, compelled me to move the drugs and money. I ran to the house and returned with the wheelbarrow. The drug bricks and cash weighed it down making the push to the barn slow going. 
Surveying the barn for a hiding place, I spotted Misery parked in the back corner. Her big tires a perfect spot. I slid between her and the wall, and stuffed the flat tire with the drugs and money. Took an ax to the other, and packed in more. I gathered some soft dirt from the barn floor and tossed it over her, making her looked like she'd been there for a while. 
I headed back to the graves, and re-burried the boxes, refilled the other holes and tried to make it. I knelt over the buried boxes and said a prayer for the babies that weren't there. 

That night my body wanted sleep but my mind buzzed like an electric razor. A mix of sadness, excitement, and fear stirred within me. Ma saw her chance to get away and stay away; I was sure now. Bee had held firm that Ma wouldn’t leave us. But why not? No sense looking for Ma. She didn’t need rescuing; she was free. 

Around midnight, a truck approached the house, awaking me. I jumped out of bed, crouched below the window sills and crept into the front room. I pulled the shotgun in-close. Hidden next to the window, I peeked through the edge of the curtain. The full moon reflected on Bobby’s pickup with five guys piled in. Bobby knew Pa was gone. What was he doing? 
He idled, motor running, lights off. No one moved: them or me. My breath deliberate and slow. 
After a few minutes, the truck rolled out, lights still off. 
I stood there a while longer until certain the house was out of their view. </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Cartel believes Mo, that David stole the $750K</Title>
            <Synopsis>FBI informant tells Cartel that no money was recovered in the raid. They don't believe Mo when he swears, he delivered the money to the dry cleaners, and they kill him to set an example. Mo's body is found in town to warn folks. </Synopsis>
            <Text>"It will be announced today," said the man on the phone. 
El Brutal listened as he paced the length of the motor home.
"Are you sure?" asked El Brutal. 
"Dead sure. FBI heads will fly, and I don't want mine to be one of them. You gotta get me out of here. We had a deal." 
"Yeah, yeah, tell me the details," said El Brutal. 
"We recovered no money, during the raid on the dry clearers. Zero-zip-nada."
"None?" 
"Not a penny."
El Brutal clicked off his phone and threw it against the wall like a fast ball in the ninth with two outs.
 "Get Johnson on the line," El Brutal screamed to his assistant in the next room. 
He picked up the phone. "Whose signature is on the last drop to the dry cleaners. 
"Let me check," said the Cartel accountant. "It's signed by Mo, $750,000 received by Mo from Aiden Manwell, and Mo delivered it to the dry cleaners on the same day."
"Was there anyone there to confirm the delivery." 
"Not usually. Dry Cleaner deliveries are usually done around lunch - they're pretty busy around then. Not likely anyone would have noticed. Besides, we don't usually require Mo to have a receipt signature."
El Brutal clicked off his phone. "Damn it."
Bobby walked into the motorhome. 
"Well, well, surprised you have the stones to walk in here," El Brutal.
"Look, look. I didn't lie to you about David. I thought he was dead. Really I did. I even helped move his body. And you know, when you move a body, you think someone's dead. But turns out he wasn't. I didn't know, really. I can make it up to you. Yeah, I can make it up to you. I know where he is, you can send one of your goons to get him," Bobby rambled. "I think he might have stole from you too, but you already know that. Of course you know that." Bobby lowered his head. 
El Brutal remained silent. So David stole my $750k? It wasn't Mo. This was proving to be interesting.
"I don't know where the stash is, but I know where David is. Really, really I do. And I was thinking, maybe if I tell you where he is, that will square things between us and I can go back to work for you. Maybe even get promoted or something for, like, helping you out on this." 
"Hmmm," El Brutal raised an eyebrow.
"Or not, whatever, just getting back to work would be good. We'd be square, right?"
"Where?" El Brutal asks. 
"Where? Here, we'll be square here, now, right?" Bobby blathered. 
"No seas menso," El Brutal said, whacking Bobby in back of the head. "Where is David and my $750k? You moron."
"$750 large?" Bobby almost choked on his own spit.
"Where's David," El Brutal screamed. 
"Oh yeah, David, of course, where is David. We got a deal, right? He's at the old hunter's shack just off of State Route 63, about 3 mile into the desert, near the river bottom. Well he's probably not there now, he was there, I mean. I don't know, maybe he's there now..." 
El Brutal clutched Bobby shirt near his neck. "Stop. Enough with your vomit. As I see it, you owe me." He said, thrusting him against the wall.
"Yeah, yeah, I owe you, sure. But I'm paying - I telling you where David it, you can get him, and maybe get your stuff he stole too." 
"You help him steal from me?" El Brutal asked.
"No! No, not me, not really. I mean I found out about it after-the-fact like. But I didn't know nothing about it before. No, no, I wasn't involved with it, or helping him or anything like that." 
El Brutal was amazed at how many words could rush through Bobby's mouth in one breath. 
"You get David, we're good, right?" Bobby's voice pitched higher.
El Brutal let go of Bobby's shirt but stayed within a nose length of his face, close enough to smell fear oozing from Bobby's pours.
After a beat El Brutal stepped back. "My goons are busy. We'll be square when you take care of David. Get me my $750k first, then kill him. Make him an example to the others. We don't tolerate thieves."
"What? Wait? You want me to kill David?" Sweat trickled from Bobbys scalp, past his temple.
"You want to be square, right? You want to play a bigger role here––what'd you call it––a promotion, right?" El Brutal ricocheted Bobby's own words. "Bring me my money and his hand and we'll be square. 
"Square. Good, that's good. Yeah, yeah. That'd be great. Okay, then, I'll figure something out. Then we'll be square." 
"You have until tomorrow, and no more chances. The money and David's head on a stick -- or your dead."
Bobby nodded. 
That little twerp might earn his keep after all. El Jefe will never know. 

 Bobby gripped the wooden banister; his legs like spaghetti, his body trembled. 
$750K? No way. I'm out of here.</Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Follow the money</Title>
            <Synopsis>(Saturday) Suzie goes to work for Mrs. J. Mrs. J gives Suzie a dollar to mark so that she can start to learn to "follow the money". Mrs. J hint at a history between Ma and Jeb. She also gently presses Suzie about Bee and tries to help her see the truth (cautiously as she eyes the scars on Suzie's wrists).

Suzie thinks Mrs. J might not have understood Pa. </Synopsis>
            <Text>After two years of drought, a ballooning bank loan, and no income, ma took in more ironing. I gleaned local corporate farms, and for a while had worked nights at the local dry cleaners, closing the store, tallying the day’s receipts. By the third year, we supported the household. 
But weekends, after chores, was my time. On Saturday, I bounced out of bed earlier than usual so that I could collect the eggs, feed the chickens and horses, and muck the barn. With the farm fallow, pa disappeared after breakfast most Saturday mornings. Sometimes he'd reappear at Church the next day, but more often we wouldn't see him until he'd come home demanding his Sunday dinner. The second the screen door shut behind him, I gathered my books and raced to Mrs. Jones, checking over my should to make sure pa wasn't lurking around. 
When Mrs. Jones returned to Jackson, she insisted I drop by her house as often as possible to continue my education. "You don't need a classroom for learning," she'd tell me. 
I looked forward to my visits with her. Bit by bit, through her stories, questions, examples and puzzles, and books, I learned real stuff, usable stuff, stuff I could use to get out of this town. Mrs. Jones taught me about money and how to track it. I couldn’t for the life of me figure what someone like me, who had dropped out of school, lived on a drought ravaged farm, and was too ugly and too mean to ever get hired, could have a knack for numbers, but oddly enough I took to it. Maybe there was a chance for me.
"The topic for this week is 'Follow the money.' Let's make this real," Mrs. Jones opened her purse and took out a one-dollar bill. "Now write something on this dollar bill, something only you would write." 
"What? Why?" I cocked my head. 
"You'll see. Now do it." 
I took the dollar bill and put three stars on it. "One for ma, one for Bee, and one for Jacob," I said. 
Mrs. Jones smiled at me and touched my arm. "Ok, now when you and your ma go shopping, be sure to use that dollar bill. Don't save it. This won't work if you don't spend it." 
"I didn't earn this," I said, holding the dollar out to her.
"You're going to earn it. I'm trying to teach you how money flows, and this is the best way. Now promise me, you'll spend it." 
I put the dollar in my pocket, shaking my head. She always won. 
"Good. Now, let's get to work on the bookkeeping. We have a lot to do," said Mrs. Jones, reaching for her ledgers and laptop. Even when Mrs. Jones was my teacher, she had done bookkeeping on the side. When she and her husband moved to Tucson, she continued to do the books for local farmers, and when she returned after her husband died, she did it full time, and took on big clients that paid for the free work she did for the farmers. 
"Wait. That's it for following the money?" 
"For now. You must be patient. What did you learn from the work you did on the books last week?" Mrs. Jones asked. 
"Well," I smiled, "Robert Thompson." I waited for her reaction. 
"And..." 
"Robert Thompson is the one leaving the rose on their door step every week for his wife, Genevieve." 
"And how did you conclude that?" 
"Easy. The florist's charge was on his credit card. The same one he uses for his farming stuff." 
"But how did you know it was the same flowers left on their front door step?" 
"Oh yeah, I called the florist and confirmed the delivery address, and dates." 
Mrs. Jones smiled, nodding her head. "You've become a little detective now, haven't you." 
"I guess all-n-all I learned that there is always a story behind the money," I said, looking at the ceiling. "Like Jeb's store. In the last few months, it is doing a lot better. Great, in fact. Just like Bobby's business. But I haven't figured out how yet. It's like a puzzle." My eyes met hers. "I would have thought Jeb's revenue would fall considering how busy the new Walmart is." I tapped my pencil on the table. "Maybe I did something wrong?" 
"Maybe. I'll review it." Mrs. Jones waved her hand, wiping away any concern. "What else?" 
"The obvious, I guess. Farmers around here aren't doing so well. Although a few of them have paid down their bank loans more than I would have expected." 
"Paid down?" Mrs. Jones sat straighter. 
"Yeah, weird, right? No farmer pays down their loan in a drought." 
"I think that's enough for today. Let's have some lemonade."
"We barely started..." 
"It's hot, that's all." Mrs. Jones snapped her laptop closed and brushed the ledgers into a drawer. 
When we stepped outside on the porch, the heat sucked the moisture from our lungs like cement drying in the sun. Her lemonade, southern sweet, diluted the stifling effect. 
Aiden drove by. He honked and waved. His old truck kicked up a cloud of dust as he passed. Mrs. Jones waved back.
"What ever happened to you two? You were inseparable when you were younger," asked Mrs. Jones. 
"Bee, that’s what happened. Boys like her better." 
"Oh? I've never seen them together, honey." Mrs. Jones said, giving me that do-you-understand look. 
 I’d nod yes, but thought no. Wasn’t worth trying to to make sense of the crazy talk. I liked Mrs. Jones, but I didn’t much care what she or anyone else thought about Bee. I needed Bee, and she needed me. End of story.
An infrequent silence filled the space between us. I swirled my glass, and the ice jingled against the sides, capturing my full attention. 
"You know you’re pretty, right?" Mrs. Jones asked. 
"Yea, sure." This was a frequent question of hers. 
"Well, that was convincing!" Mrs. Jones laughed. 
"You told me once that if I got a skill, it would help me get out of this town." 
"Nice change of topic, but yes, that’s right. If you had a skill." 
"But Aiden graduated from college, and he came back?" 
"Well now, it’s different when you have something to come back to. His daddy is getting on, and with his ma passed, Aiden came back to help. He might even take over the store."
"Board it up, you mean. Between the new Walmart and the banks foreclosing, I’m not sure how it’s lasted this long," I said.
"Regardless, his pa needed him. Aiden stepped up; his ma would have been proud." 
"But they were doing much better the last few months, right? Did you check my work?" I said. 
"Lots of reasons income rise. Don’t you worry about it. We won't be doing Jeb's books anymore, Aiden is going to do them for his dad from now on." 
The wooden rocking chair creaked as I rocked. The heat saturated my bones, giving relief to my stiff back, and soothing my aching legs. I’d never come back to help my pa, and I wondered if I'd ever done anything to make ma proud.
"She sure was nice, Aiden’s ma that is," I said, remembering her timid manner. She always said her constant cough, not a loud croup but a dry, persistent cough, reminded her to be grateful for what she had. An odd reminder, I always thought. "But Aiden’s pa never took to me. Calls me white trash - thinks that store of his makes him better than me. But he’s never plowed a field, birth a calf, or milked a cow. That doesn’t make me white trash."
"Whoa there, Nelly. Don’t you mind him. Jeb’s a good man. He’s had a rough go at it. Isn’t easy running a business nowadays, much less being a single parent." Mrs. Jones sipped her lemonade. "You know, he and your pa? They were best friends in school." 
"What? No." I shook my head. "They hate each other. He won’t even let pa step foot in his store."
"Your ma never told you that story?" Mrs Jones said, raising that eyebrow. 
"What story?"
Mrs. Jones shrugged.
"What?" I insisted. 
"Well now, I’m sorry I said anything. Not my story to tell."
She gazed north out to the Chiricahua Mountains. 
I didn’t let it go, but knew to approach it from a different angle. 
"Jeb, eh, Mr. Manwell was pretty pissed about me and Aiden. I thought he was going to kill pa that day he caught Aiden and me together in the abandoned hunting shack. But he hadn't allowed pa in his store long before that. But I reckon that didn’t help any," I prodded. 
"Sorry, not my story to tell." Mrs. Jones turned away from the scenery. "But my, my, girl! You sure have a story of your own––you and Aiden in a shack, tsk, tsk." She bounced her eyebrows and smiled ear to ear. 


Later that afternoon, I gave Mrs. Jones’ dollar bill to ma. She wasn't happy that I had accepted it, but agreed to spend it, so we walked to the store. We bought a one-pound bag of rice and ma paid with Mrs. Jones' dollar bill.  </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Aiden and Mrs. Jones afraid the stress will break Suzie</Title>
            <Synopsis>Aiden sees Cartel get a note, and overhears that it is a threat. Cartel thinks it is Aiden threatening them. Since it mentions Bee, Aiden knows it's from Suzie. He's decides not to tell the FBI. He and Mrs. Jones wonder what this will do to Suzie's psychic when Bee never returns. ***Add their concern about another suicide attempt. Aiden goes to talk Suzie off her threat. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Aiden sat on the dirt leaning against the side of The Corner Store. Just before lunch, he watched Mo strut to his truck with a duffle bag. "What the hell?" Mo said noticing the note on the seat. Aiden peeked around the corner to see what he was talking about. Mo seemed to scout the area looking for someone but didn't find anybody. He opened the door, shoving the note aside and rolled down his window. "This god forsaken place," he grumbled as he started the truck. Aiden could hear Mo's air conditioner on full blast. After a few minutes, Mo rolled the window back up, and appeared to be reading a note. 
Aiden watched as Mo flipped the note over, then flipped it back again an reread it. When el Brutal rapped on his window, Mo was visibly confused. 
"Go straight to the motorhome. No stops. Got it," said el Brutal. 
Mo looked at el Brutal, "It's got to be the boy. I think he's trying to blackmail us?" 
Aiden knew they meant him. Mo called him "the boy" just to infuriate him. But he wasn't sure what he was supposed to have done. 
"What the hell are out talking about?" El Brutal said. 
Mo read him the note. "You have Susan and Bee XXX [//todo/need last name for Bee's family] . If you don't return them by this afternoon, I'm going to the FBI and telling them about your money laundering operations here is Jackson. You have until 3:30 pm."
El Brutal looked around. Aiden popped his head behind the corner to avoid detection. 
Susan and Bee? Damn it, Suzie. What the hell are you thinking? 
Aiden stood out of sight until Mo and el Brutal had left. Then he darted to his car. 
"Caroline? Yea, is me. We have to talk," Aiden said. 
"Whoa, slow down. What's happening?" said Caroline Jones. 
"It's Suzie. She's gone and threatened the Cartel. She threatened to tell the FBI about the other money laundering stores." Aiden sped down the road to his house. "Meet me in the garage, okay? I'm almost there now." 

Minutes after Aiden arrived at the garage, Caroline Jones hurried into the side door. 
"Now tell me from the beginning," said Carolyn. 
Aiden told her about Mo and El Brutal's discovery. 
"But wait, why do you think it's from Suzie," asked Caroline. 
"The beginning asks for the return of Susan and, wait for it––Bee." 
"Oh dear god." Carolyn lowered her head into her hands.
"It's all my fault. I should have come clean with her. I was the one who suggested she go to the FBI, but not this way." 
 "Now we have to tell the FBI about the other store," Caroline said.
"No, no, no. We can't now. Don't you see that? If the FBI goes after those stores, they'llhunt Suzie down and kill her," Aiden paced the length of the garage. 
"What's her end game. She can't bring down the Cartel? And we're not even sure they have Susan? Are we?" 
"I don't know. Even if they did return Susan, assuming they have her like you said, in Suzie's mind will she just automatically think Bee is back? Or does she need to be raped or beaten to believe that?"
"This could break her, you know," Caroline said. 
"I know," said Aiden nodding his head.
"You're just about the only one who might be able to get through to her." 
"I've tried, believe me, I've tried." Aiden opened the side door. 
"Where are you going?" 
"To talk Suzie down." 

The bosses motorhome seemed even smaller with el Brutal yelling while waving the note. "Who is this Susan and Bee?" el Brutal said, "And who thinks we have them? Somebody better not be running a scam without my permission." 
"Maybe it's a joke? They don't mention any stores specifically. Wouldn't take too much to figure some were needed for an operation this size. It's got to be Jeb's boy," said Mo, "would be just like him not to ask for money. Idiot." 
El Brutal slapped him, "You better get me some answers, and yesterday!" He slammed the door on the way out.

            <Text>Newspapers landed on doorsteps and in coffee shops around town. National news websites hummed with Cartel headlines and interactive maps detailing shipments, stash house locations, and Cartel figure heads. FBI closed two tunnels: One in Jackson, and another east of Los Algodones that extended to Yuma, AZ. Over 9 tons of Marijuana, methamphetamines, and Fentanyl were seized, along with 1.2 billion in cash and annuities. Articles credited the FBI for the successful raids. Five top Cartel figures were arrested, along with dozens more of various ranks.
On page 5, a related article reported that the FBI arrested one of their own for working with the Cartel. Former Agent Bob Palmer was being held without bail. Mark Delacroix was commended for apprehending the mole that had hampered the FBI for months. </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie goes to Aiden after kidnapping </Title>
            <Text>"What the hell––? Aiden jumped up and rushed to help Suzie to a chair near the door of his garage. 
"I've had worse," I said faking a smile. 
"Where were you? I've been searching for you all night." [Aiden Searching all night for Suzie when she was kidnapped. Aiden dabbed Suzie's face with a rag, wiping the blood away. 
"El Brutal's boys got me." I winced. 
"Angel told us. What were you thinking Suzie? You can't blackmail the Cartel."
My pain morphed into anger. "Why not? What are we supposed to do? Nothing?"
Aiden's silence fueled my ire. 
"Just sit here and let them kill Ma and Bee? Because why? Because they're bullies who have this whole town shaking in their boots? It's about time someone stood up to them." 
Aiden sat with his head in his hands. [Maybe add him saying something about comparing her standing up to them to her standing up to her Pa.]
"I shouldn't have come here," I said whipping off the remaining blood on my face. "Sorry to have bothered you." 
Aiden grabbed my arm as I turned for the door. "Suzie, wait," he said in a calm quite voice. "I'm sorry. Sit back down. Let's talk this through." 
I wanted to leave. I wanted to stay. I wanted my life back and wanted this whole damn mess to go away and get back to they way they were. Handling Pa's beating were getting easier, Suzie handled his midnight visits, and Ma, she was okay, even she would want to go back to normal rather than this. We each had our role, we each took our cuts. 
"If they did this to me, what have they done to Ma and Bee?" I shivered. 
"Come on, sit down." Aiden ushered me back into the chair. "Let's start with where they took you." 
"The make shift building directly behind the motorhome," I said. 
"Hmmm," Aiden responded with a furrowed brow. 
"I know. I know. That's where I thought they had Ma and Bee." 
"And you didn't see any sign of your Ma?"
"No. But then I search the motorhome." 
"Christ Suzie, the motorhome." 
"It was all hands on deck searching for me. They thought I had left, so they all fanned out. I'd never get a chance like that again." 
I felt the papers tucked into the small of my back. Once in the motorhome it was clear Bee and Ma weren't there. Everyone had left in a hurry. Warm coffee cups sat on the desks, a half-eaten hamburger lay on top of its wrapper, with fries spilled out around it. Envelopes stood ready to be filled with the day's pay for each man. Half of them were filled. Even the safe stood open, its content beckoning me. Careful not to leave a trace, I left the money untouched. I perused the papers. I wasn't sure what I was looking at, but it had to leverage. I copied numerous pages, and placed the originals back in safe where I found them. 
"Suzie?"
Should I tell him? 
"They kept asking where Pa was and what did he know..." Something was off. 
"What is it?" Aiden asked. 
"What they didn't ask about was their stash?" It was as if a light bulb had turned on. "And they didn't use Ma and Bee as a bargaining chip to get me to talk," I said shaking my head. 
"So, you're suggesting they don't have your Ma?" 
"I don't know." 
Why didn't he mention Bee? And why did his oversight trigger anger in me? With Pa's absence, Bee seemed to fade into the background, even for me. Guilt rushed through my veins. 
"What I do know, is that Pa is in serious danger. I didn't think they'd go after him. I was just trying to deflect attention from me when I forged that note in his writing. They will kill him."
"Good. He'll reap what he sowed," said Aiden. 
I knew Aiden was right, but he was still my Pa. </Text>

El Brutal arrives in Mo's truck (mo is dead) 
Shoot out - Suzie shot in shoulder, El Brutal and FBI mole dead, FBI agent wounded 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Agent Bob Palmer left the hospital. Sweet stains, big as cantaloupes, soaked his armpits. Exiting the front doors, he clicked open his car. I scanned the parking lot. Lights of a dark-colored sedan flashed. Palmer's phone rang. I snuck out behind him and made my way to his car. 
Weaving in and out of the parked cars and staying low, I kept in eye on Palmer. He hung up his phone only to make another call. I quietly opened the back door of his car and crammed myself into the floor-well behind the driver's seat. If anyone knew where El Brutal was, it was him. 
"Hey, it's me," said Palmer into his phone as he approached the car. "I've got the info. Our friend’s confirmed it, but you need to see it... Not on the phone." He opened the door and got into his car. I held my breath.
"If it’s real, you need to move fast... Yeah, yeah, I know the place. Be there in twenty." Palmer tossed his phone onto the passenger seat. 
Ten minutes later the car stopped and Palmer got out. Were we here already or was this just a quick pit stop? I lifted my head and Palmer turned towards the car. I dropped and tucked in tight. The crackle of steps on dirt diminished with each footfall. 
I peek over the seat. We were at the quarry on the other side of town. The car was parked on the side of a building. This had to be the meeting place. Palmer walked away from the car to an earth moving tractor. He hoisted himself into the cab and scoured the quarry.
I pulled on the door handle, slow and smooth. The warm steel and protection of the building offered some comfort. I inched out, stayed low, and pushed the door partly shut. The smell of dirt and oil, sprinkled with a touch of sulfur, lined my nose. 
I lurked to the back of the car. From there I proceeded to the other side of the building. Visible through an ironwood tree, Palmer focused on the road and the sloping mounds of earth and rock around him. No shortage of hiding places here. My gun, secure in my hand. 
Footfall near the car drew my attention. Crouching lower, I peaked around the corner. Delacroix darted from the building, followed by another agent once Delacroix ducked behind another tractor twenty yards up. Not wanting Delacroix and his crew to hurt Palmer before El Brutal got here, I darted behind a port-a-potty. Next jump, and they'd flank Palmer on either side. If El Brutal sees anyone other than Palmer, he'll bolt and go underground for a long time. I can't let that happen.
Mo's gold truck barreled in from the opposite direction. Dirt and rocks flew everywhere. No doubt Mo, even from his prison cell, stung with each ding in his golden baby. Mo would have killed El Brutal himself for hurting his pride and joy. 
The truck stopped just yards from me with the passenger door on my side. Still running, El Brutal got out. He seemed to be alone. His semi-automatic in view. 
Bobby’s image hanging from the statue, his hands and fee chopped off; news report replays of women beaten, raped, and burned; photos pinned to the community board of missing men—flickered before me. Ma, Bobby, Pa, Jeb, Aiden. Deaths of children, additions, destruction of our town. The man, the monster responsible for all of it, stood close enough to smell his rotting soul. His name—apt. 
The metal in my hand heated with my fury.
Palmer stepped out from behind the tractor, his gun holstered under his FBI required jacket. 
"You alone?" Palmer asked El Brutal. 
"Good question, you?" said El Brutal.
"This info can bring you down," Palmer said.
"You've done good." 
"The whole enchilada. This will save your ass—that's better than good. And it's all yours for $500,000." Palmer seemed to enjoy this. 
Delacroix and the other agent split-up. The other agent moved close to Palmer, while Delacroix fixated on El Brutal. The passenger door of the gold-truck creaked open. A boy, no more than 13 years old, slipped out and hunkered low. He wore brand new red and white Nike(r) La Bron James Zoom Kicks. Their recent release had been big news. El Brutal had lied. Surprise. Surprise. 
"After you hand over the info."
If Delacroix knew kicks-boy was there, he didn't show it. His partner was opposite the truck now, and too high to see him. 
"Not until I get the money. Bring it tonight, to the airport. And you can watch me fly out of your life forever." 
"Well, now that does sound good." El Brutal rubbed his chin as if considering it.
Kicks-boy drew his gun and aligned himself towards Delacroix, who was oblivious to the danger. If I stopped kicks-boy from shooting Delacroix, I'd put myself in danger. But if I didn't, a young boy would die. I tucked my gun into the back cross-straps of my bra just below my neck and grabbed a metal pole leaning against the port-a-potty. 
“FBI, drop your gun,” Delacroix announced.  
Kicks-boy took aim at Delacroix.
"The head of the snake." I stepped into El Brutal's line of sight, drawing everyone’s attention. Kicks-boy flinched.
"My, my, the infamous Suzie." El Brutal raised his gun. 
Kicks-boy swung around to me. His mouth wide open, his eyes as big as fried eggs. I was right behind him. I swung the metal rod at his knees.
El Brutal's gun fired. 
Kicks-boy flopped to the ground screaming. His gun flew a couple of yards away.
A piercing pain penetrated my shoulder. 
Two more shots. 
Delacroix had dropped to one knee and pulled his trigger. His partner shot at the same time. Three shots, one dead, followed by that one second of silence broken by the cries of kicks-boy. 
"Don’t move." Delacroix's partner aimed his gun at me. My gun, still on my back, but visible to him. 
I laid on the ground. He yanked my gun. My shoulder flared with heat. But it was worth it. 
El Brutal was dead. 
"I've got her. Get Palmer," ordered Delacroix as he cuffed kicks-boy. 
His partner swirled his head right to left. 
A car started behind us.
The agent sprinted to the gold truck. 
Palmer peeled out, but before reaching the main road he came face to face with a tsunami of flashing red and blue lights and sirens.
He swerved into the desert. A barrage of gun shots thundered from the swarm of police cars, blowing out Palmer’s back window, flattening two tires. He ditched the car and sprinted through the desert. 
"You gotta be kidding me," said the agent in the gold truck. He whipped the truck into the desert and pursued Palmer. 
It didn't take long. 
By the time Delacroix and I drove up to the scene, the other agent had Palmer in cuffs and lying on the ground. The frenetic scene buzzed with cops scrambling, and FBI agents shouting orders. 
Delacroix approached Bob Palmer. 
The paramedics rushed to my aid. 
"Why Bob? Why?" 
"Why?" Palmer tried to lift his head as he spoke. "We get paid shit, eat shit from the public, deal with greedy low-lives, and live like shit with all the travel, safe houses, and stake outs. This job is crap." 
Delacroix dragged Palmer to the side of my stretcher. 
"Do you know this man?" he asked. 
"Yes, sir, he accepted money from El Brutal's men during the FBI raid on the dry cleaners." 
"Thank you." Delacroix nodded to the other agents. "Get him out of here."

            <Synopsis>Bobby takes Suzie to Ma's truck abandoned on an old road. Leaves Suzie there wondering why there is blood on the seat. Pa had been dead a while before they put in the truck, so there shouldn't be blood. ***Off scene: Bobby knows Pa wasn't dead but had planned with Susan that he would be dead before she disposed of the body. Pa fakes unconscientious and hears their plan. That's when he decides to take out Ma. -- where to add??? 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>[Maybe have Bee go off on her own suggesting that she does that often - would help explain why she isn't in the next scenes.]
The next morning, still bewildered from our find yesterday, the questions piled up: What had Pa been into? Where was Ma? Did Pa’s stash have anything to do with Ma missing? Worried and confused I rubbed my forehead. We settled-in on the porch swing with sweet tea to help calm and cool us. As we swung, I spied a dust cloud rolling in from the main road. It was too early for visitors. 
I stepped inside and reached behind the door for the shotgun. This time, I stood out on the porch, shotgun cocked. As the vehicle approached, I spotted Uncle Bobby at the wheel. 
"Whoa Annie Oakley, what’s got you so riled up?"
"What do you want?" I relaxed the shotgun on my shoulder, but left it cocked. 
"Where’s your Ma?" Bobby asked through the window. 
"What do you mean? She left with you, and," I gulped, "Pa." 
"No, we drove out together, but went our separate ways. She never came back?" 
I shook my head. 
"Well, your pickup is down by the river bottom. Happened upon it last night." 
"And Ma?" 
"Assumed she was here." 
"Anyone else in the truck?" Thinking about Pa. 
"No." Bobby said. 
I gazed at the very spot Pa laid a few days ago. very spot Pa laid a few days ago.//timeline 
 "Grab the keys, I’ll take you there," said Bobby. 
I kept the shotgun at my side, and retrieved the extra set of keys from the kitchen drawer. 
"Get in," Bobby scolded from the cab. His left eye twitched as he tilted his head like athletes do to crack their necks.
I put my hand on the dash to steady myself as Bobby sped down the road. 
"You look awful," I said. 
He scowled, "Gee, thanks." 
"You must be working hard, your shop is doing much better," I said.
"How do you know that?" Bobby's head whipped in my direction.
"Your credit card, you dolt. Remember, I help Mrs. Jones with your bookkeeping for your shop. And next time––pay cash for your hooker." 
 Bobby pounded the steering wheel. "You better not tell Susan," he said, glaring at me long enough to veer off the road onto the dirt shoulder. "Shit, shit, shit." 
I smirked. I loved figuring out the story behind the numbers. Amazing what you can learn about people you thought you knew. 
About two miles from the house, Bobby turned on to a dirt road. [//Todo/is two miles down far enough?]
"Who uses this road anymore? Isn’t this the way to the old mine?" I asked. A year or so ago it had hardly been a road at all. The miners abandoned it on account of the mine closing. For years it lay rutted and useless from the monsoons. Now the ruts were smoothed over and the road cleared, standing in contrast to the entrance still hidden by overgrown brush.
"About time you learned to mind your own damn business, little Miss Nosey." 
I rolled my eyes. "How d’you happen upon the truck out here, anyway?" The landscape changed as we approached the dry river bottom.
"Hunting," said Bobby. 
"Hunting? You hate hunting. In fact, this shotgun by my side makes you nervous––admit it," I laughed. 
Bobby had no comeback. Something was off.
"Is this where you and Pa go at night? Which reminds me, why did you come by the other night when you knew," I hesitated, "about Pa?" 
Bobby slammed on the brakes so hard that I barely caught myself before my head could hit the dashboard. "Don’t ever talk about that. Ever." Bobby grabbed my arm. "Bad enough, the mess you made with your Pa." 
"Mess I made?" I yanked free of his grasp. Bobby didn’t scare me. He had more words than Pa, louder too, but he wasn’t near as big––scrawny you’d say if you wanted a punch in the nose. I had a couple of inches on him, and 20 pounds more muscle. I could take him in a fair fight, but with Bobby, no one expected fair. 
"Listen here, Suzie. You never saw your Pa go out at night. Or me pick him up at night. And forget about this road. It doesn’t exist––got it?" His eyes locked on mine. "We’re just here to retrieve your truck. After that, forget everything." 
I’d never seen him so serious. I threw up my hands. "Okay. Okay, already." 
He held my gaze another second. "I mean it, Suzie. Ne-ver." He emphasized never like two words. Bobby shoved the gear stick into drive and pealed out. 
A little farther, I saw our truck. It rested off the road in a shallow ditch. Most of it hidden from the road except the passenger’s side, rear bumper which stuck up at an angle with the tire just off the ground. As we got closer, I saw the front driver-side bumper hugged a tree. Bobby pulled over.
I opened the driver-side door and stopped. 
"Hood opens. That’s a good start." Bobby inspected the engine. "Radiator looks fine." He pushed and pulled a few more things, then declared it safe to drive. He slammed the hood shut, wiped his hands on his jeans, and headed to his truck. 
"Don’t just stand there, get in. I got to get going," he said, but I didn’t move. "What’s wrong with you now?" he quipped. 
"There’s blood." I stood, just inside the driver-side door, glaring at the dark spot on the passenger side. 
"Of course, there’s blood, you imbecile. Happens when you shoot someone." 
"Dead men don’t bleed." I gave him a now-who’s-the-imbecile look. 
"You some doctor now, smart-ass?" Bobby cranked his ignition. "I did my good deed for the day. You’re on your own. Get out of here before someone sees you." 
He sped off, leaving me on a road that didn’t exist, with a truck I wasn’t sure ran, and blood that shouldn’t have been there.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Cartel threatens Bobby (second encounter) </Title>
            <Synopsis>Cartel threatens Bobby to produce David or die. Does this in front of the other men as a warning. </Synopsis>
            <Text>The foreman stood on the porch of the motorhome, arms crossed. Bobby kept an eye on him as he got out of the car. The foreman scanned the crowd, searched each man's face before moving to the next. 
Bobby passed him, then glanced back to see the foreman glaring at Bobby.
What's the big deal? Can't a guy take a night off? Bobby avoided eye contact with the bossman.
"Think he noticed David's not here?" Bobby asked one of the guys who drove in with him. 
"Think your dick is big?" Laugher broke out all around Bobby. 
 "Yea, yea. Funny. So funny. None of you better miss a day. You'll see then how funny it is..." Bobby chatted non-stop to the surrounding men to ease his anxiety. 
At the end of the night, the men packed up their gear, and emerged from the mine when Bobby felt someone watching him. He looked up at a big man in a suit, with a gold tooth, and dreadlocks, his eyes set on Bobby. Lowering his head he quickened his pace, but was grabbed from behind. 
Gold-man slammed Bobby at the feet of Dignified-man. 
Bobby tried to scramble to his feet. Gold-man was there with a swift kick, followed by Dignified-man yanking Bobby up by his hair to within inches of Dignified-man's face, and jammed a gun under his chin. 
"You vouched for him." Dignified-man had emphasized 'vouched' like a sacred blood oath. 
"I'm sure he'll be here tomorrow." Bobby blurted, hoping to buy time. 
Dignified-man pushed the gun in harder. "Consider yourself warned." 
The gun's muzzle pressed in hard enough to tilt Bobby's head back; the smell of vengeance bathed Dignified-man like a bad cologne. 
"Do you understand who I am––" 
Gold-man bust into hysterics when he saw the dampness grow between Bobby's legs, causing Dignified-man to whisk the gun away from Bobby's chin, across Gold-man's jaw, and back again to Bobby. "Never interrupt me," threatened Dignified-man. 
Gold-man eyes lit up. His fists clenched for battle before a deep breath enabled him to calmed his shaking, but the hate in his eyes didn't quell. 
"Either David reports here in the next 48 hours," Dignified-man said to Bobby, "or there will be consequences, and you know what they are." 
"You have my sister." Bobby responded more as a statement than a question. 
"Forty-eight hours." Dignified-man lowered his gun from Bobby's chin only long enough to swipe it across his face. 
Scoffing, he pushed Bobby to the ground. "Let this be a lesson to you all," Dignified-man lectured the other men looking on. 
In one smooth motion, he ejected the chambered bullet and tossed it onto Bobby.

            <Synopsis>Suzie is in utter despair. Doesn't know what to do, doesn't want to go on. She has a choice - to tell the FBI and get Pa arrested for killing Ma, which likely will hinder her chances of getting Bee freed; or should she can go after Bee and let Pa get away with murdering Ma (because he will have to leave town when FBI start hauling in the Cartel and she doesn't think the FBI will find him). At home, Suzie finds Bobby, fights (as in fist fights) with him and tells him Pa is alive, and Ma is dead - how can that be?? ***Bobby confesses that Pa wasn't dead when they put him in the truck, but that Susan said "she'd take care of that - he was as good as dead." </Synopsis>
            <Text>I ran screaming through the desert brush towards home. A collage of images: Ma's body, Pa's body on the front law, dead babies, mutilated chickens, fallow land, and rotten food flashed before me. Grief seared me like a branding iron, slow and seething. I feel to the ground heaving, trying to rid my body of all the death. 
I laid back and looked up. No moon, no stars, just a black void where the sky should have been. 

First light hitting the horizon woke me. I had run, not to the house, but to the babies' graves. I knew they weren't there, but the graves represented the idea of the babies that formed into some part of me. An evolving feeling sucked the air from my lungs and left a hole inside me. 
The graves had been dug up again, since I had been there and found the money. The shovel, with the engraved handle lay a few feet away. The shovel Ma had taken to bury Pa. He had been there. 
Stupid, stupid, stupid. I pounded my head. Pa had tried to grab the drugs and money and run, leaving me and Bee, to fend for ourselves. To pay for his sins with the Cartel. How could I have been so naive to think he had even a spit of decency left in him. 
I staggered my way to the house. Nothing seemed real. The sight of Aiden's truck, the 110 degree heat, and the ghosting tongues of sorrow combusted into a flashover of rage. I exploded through the door.
"Ma's dead. Ma's dead." I repeated the words each time my fists made contact with the wall. 
"Suzie stop," said Aiden. 
I continued punching the wall until my fist broke through it.
Aiden grabbed me from behind trapping my arms at my side. 
I kicked and screamed, finally pushing against the wall with my feel until we both fell to the floor. 
"Calm down." Aiden repeated over and over. 
"Calm down?" I kicked and bucked but couldn't escape his grasp. "What do you care? You were probably in on it?" I said. "Let me go."
"You going to stop punching things?" Aiden said holding tight. 
Catching my breath, I nodded. Aiden loosened his grip.
Aiden rolled on his side and faced me. Now tell me what's going on?" 
"I'm not telling you anything. You work for them." I said. 
"What? We've been through this." 
"But then you told them about the shack."
"The shack, why would I tell them about the shack?" 
"They must have gone there to get Pa, and they killed Ma. Or Pa panicked and killed Ma. She's dead," I said as if it were a news report. "She always thought he'd end of killer her. Or me."  -- If you didn't tell them about the shack them who killed Ma? Then it hits her Pa did. --
Aiden scooted closer and put his hand on my shoulder. "How? Are you okay?"
I looked directly into his eyes. 
"I saw her." My spine tingled at the flash of her face passing before me. Aiden grasped my hand. 
"I went to talk to him, warn him. Christ I was so stupid to think he had some good in him. I found her body beneath the house in the crawl space." 
"Oh my god, Suzie."
I stiffened under his embrace.
"You get word to Jacob? The Army would let him come home to help you out."
"What? Tell him I killed her?"
"What are you talking about?" Aiden focused on my eyes. 
"I wanted Ma to admit to herself that Pa was the daddy of those three babies, but she couldn't. I should have seen that. She just couldn't. If she accepted what Pa had done to Bee, what did that make her. She wanted the roof over her head, a life with her children, and she knew that would go away if she acknowledge that evil." 
Aiden didn't move.
"Sure enough, the second her brain accepted reality, bam!" I clapped my hands. "She picked up the shot gun and killed him. But he wasn't dead." 
Silence. 
"Careful what you wish for," I said. 
"What do you mean," Aiden said rubbing my arm. 
"I wished she'd do something. I loved her but also hated her for not doing anything." I wiped the tears from my face. "Well, she sure did something." 
A stillness settled in. 
"So," Aiden broke the silence, "you think if you hadn't wanted your Ma to accept the truth, she wouldn't have shot your Pa, and in turn he wouldn't have killed her." 
"Pretty much sums it up." I broke away from him and got up and moved to the couch. 
"It doesn't add up at all," said Aiden. "Your Ma was just protecting herself. She couldn't accept the truth about your Pa anymore than you can about Bee. That's how she protected herself, she knew she couldn't live with the truth. And if she couldn't live with it, then what would happen to you. So, she was, in her own way, protecting you." 
"Protecting me by ignoring Pa raping Bee?" 
"She accepted it when she realized you were strong enough to accept the truth. And with that truth, it's no wonder she couldn't allow your Pa to live. In her own way, she was a strong woman your Ma."
I searched his face, but for what, I wasn't sure. 
"You're strong like your Ma, Suzie. It's time you too accepted the truth--about Bee," Aiden said. 
It was one of those phrases I had heard Ma and Mrs. Jones say during their heart to hearts in the kitchen. It pulled at me from the inside. The truth about Bee––what did that mean? My stomach flipped with anxiety. I should be angry, but I wasn't. There was something right about what he said.</Text>

            <Text>
	Waves of rising hot air danced outside the windowpane of our three-bedroom slump block house. Over the next few weeks, the unrelenting sun wreaked havoc on the already dry and cracked ground. The scorching heat fueled our sorrow my stillborn baby and our farm. The U.S. Drought Monitor had been raised from D2 to D3, extreme drought: DefCon3 for farmers. By the government's definition, that meant widespread crop losses, heavy water restrictions and shortages. We didn't need the government to tell us that. 
Before the neighbors uttered their last syllable of condolences for the child lost, the conversation forked to farming or gossip, but mostly gossip. I watched as they huddled in the corner sneaking sideways glances at me filled with of sorrow but I felt judged - I must have done something to deserve the rape.    
After a still-birth, Pa took  the baby’s body and bury it. No name, no ceremony, no last rites. Just a cardboard box and a hole in the ground in the backyard. Once he left with the body, he didn’t come back for a few weeks.
"David gone to stay with Bobby?" said Dot, our most outgoing neighbor said to my Ma. She handed me a cup of her Aloe Vera juice made with her secret ingredient. 
"Now don't guzzle it, honey.  It's meant to be sipped," said Dot. 
Before the concoction hit my lip, the smell of Tequila filled my nostrils. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the warm sting of alcohol as it slipped down my throat. My body shuddered. I waited for my pain to subside. Dot's a good person. 
"David said he needed to get away for a bit. It's a good thing. We all grieve in our own way."   
"I'm sorry Susan, but I just don't get it. Bobby's your brother. How can he be David's friend. Between, well, you know," Margaret lowered her eyes to the empty bassinet, "and your Pa snubbing Bobby and leaving the family farm to David and not him--and he blood. I'm surprised he can even stand to look at David." 
I wondered what Margaret knew.  
"Grieving? Pa?" I scoffed. "More likely his way of paying penance."
"Penance? Whatever for?" Ma said. 
She didn’t have a clue. I wanted to ask her who she thought the daddy was? Hell, I wanted her to admit who the daddy was, but I knew she couldn’t face that demon. We all had our demons, and who was I to question hers. 
It happened on my eighteenth birthday. A message when out to all the day labors   that day to join the group of day labors in the Walmart parking lot.  
The clank of Dot' coffee cup on the wood table brought me back. 
"Come on Margaret, would you leave your farm to a convicted criminal? And besides, they never cleared him of," Dot lowered her voice, "that prostitute's murder. That poor family, not knowing what happened to their daughter after all these years."
"Well, he still could have left it to blood," Margaret said, motioning to Ma. 
"Bobby isn't one for confrontation. If he can't talk his way out of something––he just takes it..." ma's voice trailed off, "until he can't." 
Margaret and Dot exchanged glances. 
"Enough of all that." Dot waived her hands, washing it all away. "Did you all see Genevieve in town the other day, carrying that single rose?" said Dot. 
"She's still getting those?" said Margaret. 
"Every week, since their son left for Iraqi," said ma looking out the window.
"You think it's Bob Palmer?" asked Dot. "You know, since his wife died he's been lonely."
"Stop," said Margaret. "He'd never flirt with a married woman. And besides, what does it matter? Gen deserves something nice in her life." 
The women nodded in agreement. 
Ma continued to stare out the window. Was she thinking about pa? She had been kind of right. Pa couldn't give penance, he’d have to be sorry for that. He left to avoid the sideway glances and under the breath scoffs from the neighbors who poured through the house daily, offering condolences, baskets of baked goods, bags of food, and casseroles. 
Neighbors barely had enough for themselves, but during bad times they always stepped up. Losing a baby was the worst of the bad times, according to them. I don't agree. Pregnancy was a respite of sorts. Pa called Bee a fat pig during the last few months; a name we took to with affection since it meant he left her alone. And the stillbirths, those were a blessing too––no little pa's around to feed and raise. What was the sense in that? Pa’s pa was no good, pa was no good, I was no good, Bee was good but messed up, so likely pa’s baby’s baby wouldn’t be much better. And god forbid if a baby boy had lived––just another generation of beatings up-to-bat. 
People said that time would heal the hurt. Again, I’d nod on the outside, but inside there was no hurt to heal. I was never sad the babies died. Couldn’t blame them for coming into this world and saying, "Fuck no." I felt nothing but an emptiness for not wanting them at all. What kind of woman doesn’t want a baby? No matter, it ended how it needed to end, no sense crying over that. 
 
Mrs. Jones was the most persistent visitor coming three or four times a week for the first few weeks. She had been my fifth-grade teacher, but moved away for a few years with her husband, Michael, before moving back after his death. I seemed to be her special project, maybe thought I was a hopeless case she’d save. We were usually invisible to people like her: educated, fancy clothes, and a nice house. Never could figure her angle, but she never let up.
Through the years, it was during these 'grieving times' as folks called it, she and ma became friends, maybe her only friend, at least the only one I ever saw ma take more than a gossip-sharing liking to. 
On Mrs. Jones' most recent visit, she and ma had talked at the kitchen table while I pretended to pour through the books Mrs. Jones had brought me. I heard them talking about Bee, wondering what to do about her. They both looked real serious with their heads leaned in close, voices low, sniping glances at me every now and again. Sometimes Mrs. Jones would put a hand on ma’s knee and ma would put her hand over Mrs. Jones’ hand. They talked about Bee as if she was a problem. They seemed more worried about me than Bee. I didn’t need their worry, Bee did though. 
A few days later, Ma and Mrs. Jones called me into the kitchen with them. They suggested it was time Bee go out on her own. It was time, Ma kept saying. 
"What do you think about that, dear?" said Ma.
"I’m not living here with Pa without Bee. If Bee goes, I go." I left the room. My stomach turned, my pulse quickened. Where would I go? 
But it didn’t stop them talking. Walls were thin. 
"Now why would she say that?" Ma said. 
"You know, she isn’t wrong," said Mrs. Jones. "At eighteen years old, she can’t keep going on like this. She has to learn that she's strong enough to handle it. After all, ice doesn’t melt if there is no heat. People’s tolerance of Bee is waning." 
I could hear them sipping coffee. 
"It’s not 'cute' anymore," Mrs Jones continued. "She’s got to accept the truth or one of these days she is going to break, and you might lose all of her." 
"She can’t leave. And she can’t stay," said Ma.
I wasn’t sure what they were talking about, but I was sure I didn’t like it. Why would Bee leave? Why couldn’t she stay? They were talking crazy. I’d had enough of this. I walked out the front door, letting the screen door slam so they’d know I’d been listening.</Text>

            <Text>What the hell? First Betty wandering about, and now a legless chicken placed in the center of the road, some 50 yards from the house. 
Who did this? I scanned the area but saw no one. A low gurgling growl escaped through the chicken's beak. I had to stop her suffering; I wrung its neck until the evil sound stopped. 
Stunned, I tried to get my bearings. I looked towards home. A glimmer of light shown through where the front door would be. I squinted. Was it open? 
I scrambled into the pickup mashing the gas pedal so hard the rear tires spun before lurching forward the last few yards. 
I jumped out and bursted through the swinging front door. Tearing through the house, I screamed for Bee. Where was Bee? She'd be home by now. But no answer. The cupboards bare, dishes shattered, food strewn everywhere, furniture tossed. What happened here? Searching room to room, I checked closets, under beds, the bathroom, even the attic. Nothing. 
No Bee. Bee was always around in times of trouble. Where was she? 
The mysterious tornado that had ravaged the inside, had continued outside: the coop––empty, eggs shells and feather-covered chicken parts littered the ground. Nearby, an ax, shimmering in blood, evidenced the weapon used to mutilate the remaining chickens. 
The silence of the barn echoed through its gaping door. Clyde stood in his stall, even with the gate wide open. Why hadn't he left? The sight of the legless hen flashed before me. Frantic, rubbed him the length of his back to his tail, down each leg, and around his head. All good. I kissed him on the nose. 
But still no Bee. 
Grabbing a rope, I ran to the field to fetch Betty. Streaks of scabs emblazoned her side, but she had dodged any lasting damage. I led her back to the barn closing it up before heading to the house. 
Replacing the cushions on the couch, I sat, paralyzed. Where was Bee? Who had done this? 

 Dusk covered the windows before I shook off the numbness. The glass from the smashed lamps crackled underfoot as I made my way into the kitchen to switch on the overhead light. Then I saw it. 
A note. Taped to the refrigerator door. 
"Return what belongs to me, or say goodbye. You have 48 hours." 
Bewildered, I read the note again and again. Did these people take Bee and have Ma? And what did they want back? 
I surveyed the room, assessing what might be missing. I raced to my bedroom, pushed the bed, and lifted the floorboard. Breathing easier, I pulled out my money-stash.
I took a deep breath, gathering my thoughts. The note meant they didn't find what they came looking for. Maybe I could. The mysterious tornado that tore through here looked like a mild breeze by time I was done looking for whatever it was they wanted. My thorough search, resulted in finding only a pair of earrings Ma had lost, some change, a safe deposit box key, a dead rat tucked in the corner of the closet, and some porn magazines Pa stashed within a cubby in the bathroom wall, but nothing a stranger would care about. 
Ma had hid her diary inside a slit on the side of the mattress. The Sealy label, affixed by thin Velcro where the stitches used to be, covered the jagged opening. She took time making sure the diary wouldn't be discovered. 
I fanned through the handwritten journal; most of it painful memories, I guessed. But diaries recorded dreams and aspirations. Did Pa always beat her? Did Ma have ambitions? Had she written about Bee, and why she did nothing? Did she even realize why?
The cool, soft leather burned my hands. I tossed it on the bed to shed my betrayal. An envelope fell out. On the outside, in tiny print, a list of dates with amounts varying from $1.00 to $8.00. The dates representing when Pa gave Ma her weekly allowance, going back seven years––around the time Pa started doing Bee. Over fourteen hundred dollars in one hundred-dollar bills. Her independence. Her lifeline. I smiled. My back slid down the wall until I sat on the floor. I clutched the money as if holding Ma herself. She hadn't abandon us, or her would have taken her stash. I jumped to my feet. Bee was right. Ma had planned to return.
 


The rhythmic sway of the porch swing did little to calm the sense of doom that gathered around me. My heart raced, my palms clammy. A tingling in my chest sucked the oxygen out of my breath causing me to pant. I tasted danger I couldn't see. I frantically gasped for air. Something awful loomed. A hollowed out shell swung on the porch.
Ma wasn't coming back. Bee was missing. Jacob was gone. I even grieved for Pa. Abandoned. I had always dreamt of being on my own, but now the isolation was suffocating. With every frenzied breath, a panic swarmed within me. </Text>

Mrs. Jones calls FBI to deliver the paperwork

</Synopsis>
            <Text>I pulled into Bobby's place and hid Aiden's truck. Someone might have seen me leave Jeb’s. A flip of the visor in Bobby’s truck and his keys were in my hand. Bobby was a creature of habit. The keys took on a mirage like appearance. I wiped the eyes. Bobby was gone. 
Shuddering, I started his truck and headed to Aiden's garage to meet Mrs. Jones. 

Mrs. Jones jumped up and met me at the door. "My child, what's happened to you? Are you alright?" 
"Aiden's been shot," I said, bursting into tears. 
"What?" Mrs. Jones guided me to a chair. 
"My Pa, and Jeb too." 
"Are they alive?" 
"I don't know." My tears flowed. Mrs. Jones held me in her arms and petting my hair smooth. 
"Ma's dead too," I said. I wiped my tears. "But there's no time for this." I opened my backpack and pulled out the stack of papers. 
Mrs. Jones looked at the papers and back to me. 
"I need your help. There's something here, but I'm not sure what." 
Mrs. Jones read the first page, flipped it over, and repeated until the last page. I sat and watched her, noted every flinch, every flicker in her eyes.
"You've done it, Suzie. You've got them," Mrs. Jones said after she flipped the last page. "It's everything. Times and dates of shipments, names of bosses, even deeds to land owned by the Cartel under various shell companies. Everything. Where did you get it?" 
"Doesn't matter. A lot of people lost their lives because of that." I rubbed the stack and thought of Ma, Bobby, Angel's Pa, the dozen or more men who had disappeared, Father Joe, and Father John, not to mention the hundreds and hundreds poisoned by their drugs. "And this town. They killed this town." My eyes glued to the stack. 
"Let's call the FBI," Mrs. Jones said, lifting her phone. 
"No. Not yet." I snatched the phone from her hand. "They've been one step ahead the entire time. We can't trust them."
"What then?"
"First, we need to add some information to give them the whole picture." 


"It's 3 a.m. This better be good," said Agent Delacroix, answering his phone.
"Yes, sir, sorry about the time, sir, but I think this is important. A Mrs. Caroline Jones is here with a package of documents she said was anonymously delivered to her. There in a clear plastic bag." 
"Documents?" 
"Yes, sir. She showed me the top page.” He lowered his voice, “It's the organization chart of the Cartel, with names." 
"Holy shit. Call in everyone. I'm on my way." 

Mark Delacroix entered the FBI office. Mrs. Jones greeted him by handing him the plastic zip-locked bag filled with documents, 3 inches thick. The top document, an organization chart that announced the names of all the top dogs in CC13, many whom Delacroix knew, but many he didn’t. 
Mrs. Jones pulled the package into her chest and folder her arms over it. "In this package is everything required to bring down the cartel. I need your word you'll live up to your promise that Jeb, his family, Suzie, and any store owners threatened into participating in the Cartel's money laundering operation won't face any charges." 
"If that is what you say, I have no need to go after anybody but the Cartel." 
Mrs. Jones handed the package to the Agent. A quick perusal told Delacroix it was likely legitimate. A smaller typed note tucked on top read, 'In one week this info goes public'. 
"What the hell, Caroline? You're threatening to go public with this?" Delacroix raised his voice. 
"Not me. That's how I got it. I couldn't sleep. When I got up, I found this on my computer station, in my home." 
"Aiden?" 
"No, he's still in the hospital, his father too." 
"Have you read it?" 
Caroline nodded. 
"Credible?" 
"I'm no expert, but I'd say so. The numbers they mention align with the what I know about the money laundering operations. Seems authentic." 

Before sunup, Delacroix assembled over a 100 agents, who were steeped in planning. The room buzzed with coffee and speculation. Delacroix had the IT team shut down the internet to and from the building, searched and confiscated all wireless and cell devices including phones, wireless mp3 player, e-readers, and smart-watches. He wasn't taking any changes of this getting back to the Cartel. 

The FBI accelerated its normal procedures and set out to raid, round up, and collect as much intel, drugs, money, and Cartel members in the coming days as possible. Delacroix excluded local police. The documents included names of cops and amounts paid to them over the years. He didn't want to take the chance there were others. So the state police, FBI agents from around the country, INS and DEA agents were brought to execute simultaneous raids throughout the southwest and parts of Mexico with the cooperation of the Mexican government running their war on drugs.
"Hey boss, where's Bob? I figured he'd be coordinating all this for you," said an FBI Agent. 
"I've got him out checking out credible intel in Phoenix. He should be back later." Delacroix said. 
"Really? Phoenix? Man, he's gonna be pissed he missed this." 
All the local agents chuckled. 
Raid groups were assigned, and each group briefed separately with details specific to only their operation. Delacroix, alone, grasped the complete plan.
"Okay, everyone has their orders. When it's your turn to execute, I'll call you. Do not move until you get that call. Understood?" said Delacroix. "Okay then, you're dismissed.”
Bob Palmer walked in through the door. "What's going on? What's happened?" he said to agents storming out the door. 
“Bob, welcome back. My office.” Delacroix motioned towards his office.
"What's happening?" asked Palmer.
Delacroix pulled a chair in front of Bob, sitting knee-to-knee to his second-in-command. He wanted to see the man's eyes. 
"We got intel about the Cartel. Maybe credible, may not. But more important, and not publicly known, we have a mole."
"A mole?" Bob shifted in his chair.
"Yep, and until we identify him, or her, they could alert the Cartel and this would be a very public FBI fuck up."
Bob cleared his throat. "How can I help, boss?"
"I want one other person to understand the whole plan. The exact timing of each of the raids, everything." 
"Sure boss, lay it on me." 
The next hour Delacroix briefed Bob on a plan, but not the plan.
"So, I need you to go straight to the first raid location and scout the area. Report back to me. We need to confirm that it’s in fact a Cartel stash house before barging in." 
"Thanks, Mark. I appreciate your trust." Bob read the piece of paper he took from Mark. He nodded to Delacroix and left the room. 
Another agent poked his head into Delacroix's office. "All set?" He nodded towards Bob. 
"Yep, I hope I'm wrong though," said Delacroix.

It was a winding, poorly maintained but paved road that crossed the river bottom in several places. It was flanked by gullies, thick with Palo Verde trees, Ironwoods, and Joshua. The mine was seven miles in from the main road.
The maps showed a utility service trail that ran parallel to the ol' Mine Road, but was a straight shot, cutting out almost four miles. I made a mental note to check that out.
On my way back to the house, an SRP crew worked at the entrance to the utility service trail. I pulled over across the street and hopped out.
"Hey there," I said to the workers. They looked up and nodded. I recognized one of the men. at Aiden’s welcome home party. //todo/did we have a party? 
"You’re Sammy, right? We met at Aiden’s place last week." 
"Yeah, I remember you. What you doing out here?" Sammy stepped away from the crew towards me. 
"My house is a mile or so that way. I noticed your trucks here and wondered what's happening. Our power's been glitchy, you know, flickering, and outages and stuff. Flickering, and outages and all that." //Todo make sure this happens earlier in story 
"Yeah, seems to be getting worse, we're checking it out," said Sammy. "Something's causing a lot of power surges." 
"You maintain this trail?" I looked past him, down the dirt trail under the big power lines. 
He turned to look at the trail with me. "SRP does, yeah, but that’s a different crew. I only work on the electrical part of things."
"Sure looks clean. Nothing like the Ol' Mine Road." 
"They clear the brush eight feet on either side to keep the lines out of any fires around here. Doesn’t always work, but usually helps." 
"Can anyone use this trail? Like regular people?" 
"Regular people?" Sammy laughed. "If you mean folks who don’t work for SRP, then no, they shouldn’t be using it. But people do anyway."
"What for?" 
"Mostly, raising hell. Kids on their three-wheelers––that kind of thing. Sometimes we get coyotes in the middle of the night transporting illegals, and who knows what else. Our cameras catch them." He lifted his eyes to the top of a nearby pole."
"Three-wheelers." It got me thinking. 
"Why the interest?" Sammy asked. 
"No reason. Like I said, saw your trucks. Hey, you know anyone that owns a three-wheeler? Sounds fun." I tried to sound casual. 
"Yea, so do you," Sammy said, "Aiden." 
"Really? I didn’t know that. I doubt he’s raising hell, anywhere." We both laughed. 
"I better get back to work. Good to see you again." Sammy headed back to the SRP crew huddled around the truck tailgate. 
I crossed the road and jumped back into the truck, but instead of home, I made a u-turn and headed back to town. 
As I drove up to The Corner Store, I noticed the gold dually truck in the first spot out front. I parked next to it. As I got out, I casually peered into the cab. Damn thing was tricked out: dash was trimmed in gold, the door handles, buttons, and vents––all gold.
I didn’t want Aiden’s Pa making a scene because I was in the store, so I snuck into the alley to hang-out until Aiden came outside to take a break, or toss the trash. The back door was propped open with a cinder block. I slipped behind the door, and sat on a crate, waiting. Two men were talking, one was Jeb, and the other voice I didn’t recognize. Jeb sounded more ornery than usual. 
"We need to pick up the pace to 250 this week," demanded the stranger. 
"250? Who's gonna believe my little store did $250k? Hell, the Walmart probably didn’t bring in that yet." 
"What do you care? You’ll get your cut," the stranger sniped. "The vendor invoices and the cash register receipts will back it up as usual."
Who was this guy? I cocked my head trying to catch a glimpse of him. As I did, the crate shifted enough to make a slight noise. The conversation inside stopped, as did my breathing.
"Aiden is that you?" Jeb yelled. Footsteps approached the back door. I froze. The door opened a few inches. "Anyone there––," Jeb hollered. 
"You need me, Pa?" Aiden asked from the far side of the room. Jeb released the door, which banged against the block. I exhaled. 
"Glad you’re here. Our friend here says we need to up it to $250 this week." 
"Wow, uh, okay," Aiden responded, "What brought this on, if I can ask?" 
"Tunnel’s open for business, boys, keep up, or get out." Just as the stranger said, 'get out' he stepped into my line of sight. He'd been at Jeb’s store before, sitting in the back room at a table working on the books. He was unmistakable with this dark blue suit and pressed, white, tabbed collar shirt offset by his dark nose hair, a gold front tooth, pocked skin, and unwashed white-man’s dreadlocks dangling past his shoulders. He wore two gaudy gold chains around his neck over his designer tie, gold cuff-links the size of a quarter that looked like a gold version of somebody’s family crest, a gold watch with the face the size of a silver dollar studded with diamonds, and one gold stud earning in his left ear. Man, this guy had a thing for gold. Even the tattoos that jutted out from under his cuffs, and up from his collar were done in gold. He looked like some weird transformer evolved from the clothes of the Godfather, the hair of Marshawn Lynch, [ML didn't play until 2007, need one who played in 2000 with dreadlocks.] [//todo need player from early 2000] the jewelry of a Mr. T from the 80’s TV show, the teeth and skin of a Hells Angles member, and tattoos any death-row inmate would envy. No doubt he was the owner of the that gold Ford dually truck. 
"Yeah sure, we’ll keep our end of the bargain." Aiden said. "Come on, Pa, let’s get back to work." 
Footsteps faded away, and the room went silent.

As I waited for Aiden to come out, I played Gold-man’s words over and over. So this was how The Corner Store’s revenue doubled each month. The revenue wasn't real, but the bank deposits were. They were laundering money for the Cartel. That explains their books. But Aiden's reaction was so calm, so agreeable. Jeb at least sounded angry. Aiden was in on it with them. Was this why he came back?
I couldn’t think about that. Finding Ma was my priority. I’d deal with Aiden later. Bee should have listened to me, Aiden is no good for her. 
Waiting in silence, my plan emerged. The three-wheeler idea was gaining traction. I’d get as close to the mine using the utility trail; the Ol' Mine Road was too busy with workers and Cartel bosses. A half a mile out, I’d hide the bike in the brush and head in on foot.
Startled by the back door swinging open, I jumped out of its way before it hit me. 
"What the heck?" Aiden said. 
"Hey, hoping I’d catch you," I said, trying to sound carefree. 
"How long have you been there?" Aiden looked serious, glancing back inside. 
"Just got here." I bit my tongue.
"What’s up." 
"Nothing. You know." I should have thought of what I'd say. "Hey listen." I tried to gather my thoughts.
"You’re acting weird," Aiden glanced back at the door.
"Sorry. I wondered if I could borrow your three-wheeler." 
"My ATV? Why?" asked Aiden.
"No reason. We’re not planting the fields, and I've got the time, and it's something I've wanted to do." 
Aiden’s brow tightened as his eyes seemed to search for something in my face. "So, you’ve given up on the idea of looking for your Ma? To have fun and all. Why the dramatic change of heart?" 
I shrugged my shoulders. 
Aiden squinted at me. "Okay. But on one condition," said Aiden. 
"What’s that?" 
"You stay off the Ol' Mine Road." 
"Yeah, sure," I responded. 
"Really, Suzie. I’m serious. I’ll know if you’re on it."
"I bet."
"What’s that supposed to mean?" said Aiden.
"Nothing. I'm being a smart-aleck. So? Can I use it?"
"I will know. I installed a LoJack after those thefts last year on campus." 
I looked to the ground. 
"You agree to stay off Ol' Mine Road."
"All right already. Yes, I agree." I threw my hands up in the air. "Now, can I use it?" 
"Let me get the keys." Aiden eased back inside. A minute later, he held out the keys. "It’s behind my house, under the lean-to." Aiden pulled back the keys. "You even know how to ride it?" 
I hadn’t thought about that. "Well, the way I figure it, if I can ride Ol’ Misery, I can ride any thing." I snatched the keys from his hand. "Thanks. I’ll get it back to you in a few days," I yelled back as I rounded the building, jogging to my truck.

            <Synopsis>Pa confronts Jeb to find S but ends up in a shoot out 
S shoots Pa dead, Jeb is shot, Aiden is shot, Suzie gets away. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Jeb's backroom was quite for this time of day. Aiden closed the door to the store. 
"We've got to go to the FBI," said Aiden.
"No, the FBI doesn't care about your Pa and his store. And the other stores sucked into the Cartel's money laundering cesspool? And who is looking out for those missing men like Angel's Pa?"
Silence lingered in the air like bad incense. 
"And besides," I continued, "have you forgotten about the FBI mole? 
"What about your Ma? Shouldn't we tell them about her? We can't just leave her body out there." 
"What? You think I want to leave her there?" I glared at him. "If Pa knows, that I know Ma’s dead, he'll kill me too." 
"Then we have to tell them the Cartel threatened you," Aiden pressed. 
"Yeah, like that's never happened before. I have no intention of having my tongue cut out and buried alongside Bobby's hands and feet. What's with you trusting the FBI like their your best buddy?" 
"It's not like that. We need help, that's all." 
"I could return their money," I said out loud. 
"No way, once they have it, you're dead," said Aiden. 
"Looks like I'm dead no matter what. I was wrong, I thought if I hurt them, they'd go away. I’ve been wrong about a lot of things." My hand held Aiden’s. 
"Only one way out of this. It's them or me," I said. 
"We need hard evidence," said Aiden.
"Evidence," Suzie said. With her hand on the door knob she turned back to Aiden. "I need a favor," said Suzie. 
Aiden cocked his head, "Anything." 
"Get word to El Brutal that Pa is at the shack. And give me the number of your FBI contact." 
"But why?" 
"For an anonymous tip." 
A raucous argument broke out on the other side of the door in Jeb's store.
"Leave now," Jeb screamed at a man who had burst through the door. 
Aiden and I peered out from the back room. 
Jeb stood behind the counter facing Pa whose back was to us. Pa held a pistol at his side. 
"Where's your no-good son? He'll know where Suzie is. Never could keep it in his pants." My Pa tapped his gun against his thigh.
I held Aiden back. 
"You better tell me, or you can join your beloved Susan." Pa mimicked the kickback of a gun. 
"What the hell have you done to Susan?" Jeb said, reaching under the counter. 
Minutes turned to seconds, and seconds slowed to eternity. Before Jeb got the gun above the counter, my Pa raised his gun. 
"Pa, look out," Aiden said, rushing through the door. Ma's voice rang in my head--Pa wasn't going to hurt anyone ever again. He's sure as hell wasn't going to take Aiden from me again. I ripped the gun from backpack.
Three guns fired. 
Jeb fell back. 
Aiden fell to the ground, hitting his head on the corner of the counter. 
Pa crumbled into the fertilizer display. 
A hush, layered with groans of pain and topped with stillness, stifled the room. The other patrons frozen in place. 
Enough! This must stop. 
I grabbed my backpack and Aiden's truck keys and escaped through the back door.</Text>

            <Text>The swamp cooler, servicing Jeb’s backroom offered no relief during monsoon season in Arizona. Air, heavy with moisture, dampened not only everyone’s clothes but also their moods. Sweat of desperation stained Mark Leon’s shirt; he needed this job. 
"Wife’s name?" asked a large man wearing a dark suit, looking at the incomplete job application. 
Mark Leon, a local farmer, hesitated, fascinated by the glint coming off of the man’s gold tooth that matched his gold earning.
"Do you want the job or not?" 
"Abegail," Mark replied. 
"Kids? How many, and names?" 
"My kids?" Sweat beads formed.Mark cocked his head.
"You heard me. Now answer or get out." 
Mark had three inches and thirty pounds on the man in front of him. He locked eyes with him. Remembering his drought-devastated farm, and the bank notice on his desk, he lowered his stare to his lap. 
"Angel and Maricela," said Mark. 
"You know how this works?" 
"No, just that you're hiring," he cleared his throat, "and you pay good." 
"We do," said the man, "but not for nothing." 
The farmer furrowed his brow. 
"Look, you work hard, do what we say, and mind your own business. But mostly we pay you to stay quiet." The man lifted his face to the blowing air. "Get it? You can’t tell anyone, not an-nee-one, about where you work, who you work for, or what you're working on," the man said, spiting as he talked. 
"But what do I tell my wife?" asked the Mark. 
"What the fuck do I care." The man tapped the application. "My insurance. Tell no one. Or your family pays." 
The farmer’s eyes opened wide, he drew-in his chin. Who are these people? His breathing, rapid and shallow. 
"But for $500 per night for six hours work, it should all be worth it," said the man. 
"$500? Per night?" The pit in Gilbert's stomach tightened. With that kind of money, he’d be back on his feet in no time. He wouldn’t have to stay long at all. This can’t be legal, he thought, but his god-fearing life did nothing to pay his mortgage, or feed his family. 
"Yeah, 500-bucks per night. You think you can keep your trap shut for that?"
The farmer’s head nodded as acid rose to his throat. 
"Start tonight. See you at midnight." The man opened the back door. "Julio," he called out. 
"Whatcha need, Mo?" said Julio.
"We got another one," Mo laughed and shoved the compliant Mark out the door, causing him to stumble to the ground.
Outside, in the alley, a few men gathered around the recruit. 
"You get the rules?" said the big one.
 Mark nodded, brushing himself off. 
"Say 'em." 
Mark repeated the rules; they were hard to forget. 
"Okay then. Now, tell your wife, family or friends, anyone who asks, that you’re working on a construction crew for the new casino." 
Mark had never lied to his wife. But if he didn't, he'd lose the farm. He nodded agreement to the lesser sin. 
The smaller guy said he’d swing by Marks' house at 11:45, for his first night’s work. 

As planned, a truck arrived at Gilbert’s house just before midnight. No honk, it just sat there. Mark fought with his wife earlier that evening about whether he should go. Abegail was no dummy. She knew he was lying, but she lived with the desperation they both felt. Mark jumped into the truck-bed while Abegail listened from the bedroom.

While Mark adjusted to his new job, a man crept to the back of Mark’s home where his wife and children lay sleeping. He glanced into a window and could almost smell the homemade apple pie cooling on the counter. He picked the lock and stepped into the house, taking a beat to insure no one stirred. A fork laying on a mat next to sink called out to him and he dug into the pie. Stuffed, he stuck the fork, upright, into the unfinished half. 
He eyed pictures of a young girl, woman really,  and an older looking boy taped to the refrigerator door. Removing the fork from the pie, he placed the pictures on the crust. With more force than needed, he stabbed the children's photos and left the fork protruding from their faces. 
He inspected his work. A grin spread across his face. 
He slithered out the backdoor. 

Around 5:00 am, Gilbert’s first shift ended. The group of men flowed out and formed a line. 
"What's going on?" whispered Mark. 
The man standing next to Mark looked straight ahead and said nothing. His eyes blank. Like a sheep, Mark joined the line, not knowing why but not wanting to be the only man who didn’t. When he got to the front, the foreman offered Mark an envelope, but when he reached for it, the foreman pulled it back.
"Remember the rules," said the foreman. 
Gilbert's eyes darted. 
"Tell NO one. We know where you live with your precious Abegail and your two hijos, Angel and Maricela," continued the foreman, botching the Spanish word for children. He held out the envelope again. 
Mark hoped the anger rising from his neck––like the foam of a pot ready to boil over––might fuel his courage to spit in his eye and refuse the envelope. That's what a real man would do. 
But he wasn't a real man. A real man could feed his family and keep a farm alive without help from likes of these men. Snatching the envelop, he'd never felt so small. 

When Mark arrived home, his wife, Abegail, was pacing the length of the porch. Mark’s mouth went dry.
Abegail took him by his arm and ushered him to the kitchen. She pointed to the apple pie. 
Anger laced with fear pumped through Mark. The money in his pocket seared his thigh. He ripped the fork out of the pie and tried to clean the pictures as best he could, but the fork holes in the middle of his children’s faces sent the intended message. We know where you live. 
"It won't happen again." Mark turned to check on the kids. 
"You know who did this? 
"Leave it, Abegail. Just leave it." Gilbert’s head spun, every muscle in his body tight.
"Like hell. I'm calling the police," said Abegail.
"No!" He grabbed his wife's upper arms and shook her. "No police."
"You're hurting me." She pulled away. "What’s going on, Berto?" 
Mark couldn't move. He watched his wife rub her arms. 	God, what have I done?
"What would we tell them? Someone ate our pie and moved the photos," he forced a chuckle, trying to lighten the mood. "Besides, everyone knows you make the best pie in town. Who wouldn’t want to break-in for that?" He pulled his wife in for a hug. "Did the kids see this?" 
"No, they're still sleeping." 
"Good. Good. Let’s get this cleaned up. And forget all about it." </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Cartle considers new threat</Title>
            <Synopsis>Cartel realized the 1st threat was not a hoax. Bobby tells them who the people are in the note: Susan is David's (Suzie's Pa) wife, and Bee is David's daughter (Bobby goes along with the facade because he really sin't sure what's going on). They zero in on David as the one making the threats, but don't understand how they are supposed to return two people they don't have. (Major revelation to reader that the Cartel doesn't have Ma or Bee). During discussion, 2nd threat is delivered. Cartel lash out at Bobby, telling him he has to find David and stop this -- or else; and decides to put an end to this now. </Synopsis>
            <Text>//Todo/** add either at end or next scene something about how Bobby got away and how he feels. 
The afternoon sun penetrated the back slump block wall of Jeb's store heating up the back room where Mo and El Brutal stood towering over Bobby and Aiden seated at the table. 
"So that first note was no joke," El Brutal said drilling daggers into Mo's eyes. "We'd just dropped $750k at the cleaners. Someone's going to pay." El Brutal slammed Susie's original threat on the table. 
Both Mo and El Brutal starred at Aiden. 
"What? Why are you looking at me. I warned you the FBI was on the way."
Bobby glanced down at the note with its creepy cut-out, tapped letters. 
"So you did," El Brutal said flatly. 
"Wait," Bobby turned the note toward him. "The note demands the return of Bee?" Bobby looked up. 
"Susan and Bee," said Mo. "Why? Does that mean something to you." 
Aiden gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head to Bobby realizing Bobby could blow everything. 
"Well," Bobby looked down at the note again, Aiden could see the wheels spinning and had faith that the con man could smell a con, "Susan is David's wife, and Bee is his daughter." Bobby nodded affirmatively as if putting a period on his statement. Aiden's heart slowed to normal; Bobby had not mentioned Suzie, or outed Bee. 
Before anyone could process the information Mo's truck alarm started to blare. At first, everyone looked around as if accusing the other of setting of the alarm. Then Mo rushed out followed by Bobby, Aiden and El Brutal. Once outside, heads swiveled searching for the culprits, but none were found. Mo inspected the truck for damage. 
"No damage," Mo announced, still inspecting the car. 
"Turn the damn alarm off you idiot," El Brutal said. 
Mo fumbled for his keys and pressed a button. The alarm ceased. He opened the door to inspect the inside and he saw it. 
Another note, this one was hand written. 
"What the hell is going on here?" El Brutal said. "Read it out loud." 
"...and if this Bee and Susan aren't there by noon, this person, whoever this is, will tell the Feds about our other stores. They also threaten to talk about the stash house and the tunnel," Mo paraphrased the note. 
Aiden watched silently as El Brutal's face turned blood red, veins bulged from his neck and forehead, his fist were balled. "Somebody better start telling me what the fuck is going on here?" 
Bobby took the note from Mo and inspected it. "This is David's handwriting." 
"What? You sure?" Mo said.
"I've know him since I was born. I'm sure. Besides, look how he spelled XXX. Only David does that." Bobby flipped the note over, and back again. His brow was furrowed, the wrinkles in his leathered face darkened. 
Three teenagers walked out of the bakery across the street, talking fast and laughing. 
"Let's take this inside," El Brutal ordered. 
Bobby and Aiden followed. Bobby mouthed the words, "Can't be" searching Aiden's face. Aiden shrugged unsure what was happening but knew it could have only come from Suzie. 
The wind slammed the front door of Jeb's store. And Mo slammed the door to the back room. 
"The same David you brought us," Mo said glaring at Bobby, "and who hasn't showed up for work the last few nights?" Mo moved towards Bobby. Bobby clenched the arms of the chair. El Brutal stepped between them.
"Hold up. Let's hear what he has to say, then you can kill him," El Brutal said as if he was ordering a burger and fries.
Bobby looked up at El Brutal, over to Aiden, then darted to Mo. 
Mo whacked the back of Bobby's head. "So..."
"That's David's hand writing, that's all." He nodded to the note Aiden was now reading. 
"So where is he, you moron?" said Mo. 
Bobby glanced over to Aiden who held his gaze steady. 
"I thought he was dead." Bobby lifted the note and shifted in his seat. "I thought he was dead." 
"Were you lying to us when you said he was ill, or are you lying now?" Mo placed his foot between Bobby's legs on the edge of the chair, thrusting the chair back two feet. 
Bobby grabbed the sides of the chair. "Damn it, damn it, damn it. I'm not lying, I thought David was dead, I mean he is dead, hell I don't know, I think he's dead––"
"Enough," said El Brutal, slamming his hand on the table. "So why does he think we have his wife and daughter?" El Brutal looked at Mo.
"No. No way. No one in our crew is behind this," said Mo shaking his head. 
"You better be fucking right," said El Brutal. 
"Where is David now?" Mo looked at Bobby, then Aiden. 
Aiden shrugged. 
"I don't know, I just don't know, I––" started Bobby.
El Brutal threw up his hands. "For fucks sake, shut-up. We know where he'll be tomorrow at noon."

</Synopsis>
            <Text>I found some comfort from the State Police guard stationed at the door to Aiden and Jeb's hospital room. I sat between Jeb and Aiden's beds, holding Aiden's hand. It was me in that bed and him holding my hand, just two days ago. I kept my back to Jeb. He wouldn't keep me from being with Aiden.
"Is Aiden going to be okay?" Jeb said to the back of my head. 
I turned to look at him, pondered whether to I respond. "He is in a comma. Something about swelling in his brain. They say he needs time." 
"Was it my shot?" 
He'd find out soon enough. Better he find out from me rather than the FBI.
"He's going to be fine. It will take time." 
"I shot him, didn't I?" said Jeb. 
"It was a freak accident. Your shot ricocheted off the freezer and grazed the side of his head. They say he's lucky, the freezer took most of the force. More damage was done when his head hit the counter."
"Jesus Christ." Jeb turned his head toward the door, away from Aiden. 
"Your Pa get away?" 
"No, sir, he's dead." 
"Dead? How?" 
"I shot him," I said, surprised at how easily it came out. 
He turned back to me. "Christ, girl. Can't say he didn't deserve it."
Did he deserve to have his daughter and his wife shoot him? 
"What was he saying about your Ma? Back in the store, did you hear him?" 
I got up and stepped towards his bed. His voice warm, his concern genuine. 
"She's dead," I said softly. 
Jeb's eyes filled with tears, and again he looked away. 
Mrs. Jones' words flooded back, 'It's not my story to tell'. It struck me out of no where. 
"You loved her," I said, as if it was a known fact.
Jeb took a deep breath. "Yes, a long time ago. But I never really stopped loving her."
"That's why you hated my Pa?" 
"I hated your Pa because of what he did to your Ma. Your Ma and me was an item in another life-time. But one night, when she was walking home from my place, she ran into your Pa. He told her she was too good for me, and that he'd show her what a real man was like. He..." Jeb's fist balled, shades of red anger rose from his neck to his cheeks like a tsunami. 
"He killed her didn't he?" Jeb said through gritted teeth. 
I nodded. 
He grabbed the bed rail and shook it. "Damn him to hell." 
"What's with all the racket. Can't a guy get some sleep here?" Aiden said from his bed. 
I whipped around, "You're awake! Nurse, nurse," I yelled.
The nurse rushed in. I moved against the wall to get out of the way. A man in a suite followed her. He held back while the nurse checked out the two patients. 
It was him. The Clark Kent looking man. The agent with the cartel boys when the FBI raided the dry cleaners. He was the FBI mole. Why hadn't Delacroix pulled him yet? I had provided him everything he needed. I slipped in to the bathroom, leaving the door open a crack. 
"We didn't expect you to come around so soon," said the nurse flashing a light into Aiden's eyes. "The doctor will be in soon. You're doing much better than expected." 
The FBI agent cleared his throat. The nurse turned and glared at him.
"You feel up to talking to the FBI? If not, I'll tell him to go." She put her hands on her hips, cocked her head, and solidified her stance, daring the agent. 
"No, it's okay, we can talk," Aiden said. His Pa nodded in agreement. I listened through the door. 
The agent introduced himself as Bob Palmer. He said he worked with Mark Delacroix, who was busy at the moment and had asked him to interview them. 
He's the mole, I said over and over in my head, hoping to transmit it to Aiden. 
"Busy?" asked Aiden, "Doing what?" 
The agent tossed a photo copy document Delacroix had provided him. "You know anything about this?" 
"Are you accusing me of something?" Aiden said. Jeb sat up straighter. 
"Well?" pressed the agent. 
"Well, what? I've never seen that before." Aiden flashed the document towards his Pa, who shook his head. 
"No, never," Jeb said. 
"It just showed up yesterday in Caroline Jones' house, and you know nothing about it?" 
"Yesterday? Check your facts, dude. I was shot a day earlier? We both were. We sure didn't deliver anything, anywhere." 
The agent turned towards Jeb. 
"Then who?" the agent turned back to Aiden.
"How the hell do I know?" Aiden winced as he adjusted himself to sit up straighter. 
"Who? Mo? Bobby? Who?" the agent pressed. 
"I'll tell you again, I've never seen that paper and do not know who gave it to the FBI." 
"Well," said the agent, sounding less hostile, "if you're up for it, I'd like to go through the rest of this with you and see if you can confirm any of the information. El Brutal’s gone underground, and this might help us find him." 
Aiden was quick to agree, too quick, I thought. He was about to confirm information to the one person who could blow this FBI operation to smithereens. </Text>

They talk about Suzie getting out of the town someday - but she won't leave w/o Bee and Ma.***Add that Suzie looks at her wrist scares when she thinks about leaving w/o Bee. Tells Suzie to come to her place to work anyway. </Synopsis>
            <Text>In most parts, the sunrise would have portended a glorious day. But in these parts, it was insidious. Beguiling but harmful.
We finished breakfast and pa left without saying a word. With the drought-ravaged crop not even worth gleaning, what did he do all day?
A knock echoed at the front door. 
"Caroline," ma opened the door, grimacing at the books in Carolines’s hand; she surveyed the yard. 
"Don’t worry, honey, I waited until he left." Caroline Jones stepped into the house, nudging ma aside more with her over all presence than with the weight of her skinny, five foot two frame. 
Ma looked at the ground. "You know you shouldn’t be bringing those around." 
"You know, I should." Caroline raised her left eyebrow and stared at ma until she met her eyes and nodded.
"He doesn't want you seeing Suzie anymore." 
"Really? He doesn't does he?" Mrs. Jones said laying the books on the table. 
"It could get bad for us," Ma's head was hung low, her eyes focused on the ground, "if you continue." 
"Never you mind, sweetie, I'll take care of him." Mrs. Jones flicked her hand twice as if swatting flies. "Let's see what we have here." 
Mrs. Jones and I sat on the couch. Ma sat in the stuffed chair kitty corner to us. 
"Boy, I just don't know when this weather is going to break," said Mrs. Jones, wiping her brow. 
"What ya bring this time?" I asked. 
"Ya?" As my former teacher, she could never resist correcting me. 
"What did you bring?" She was alway correcting my english. 
Ma smiled and picked up her knitting. Although ma was always nervous pa would find out about her visits, she had grown accustomed to Mrs. Jones stopping by unannounced, looked forward it even, and Mrs. Jones was always discreet. Although her presence alone provoked Pa, she extended him a deference I didn't think he deserved, saying we all had our cross to bear. 
"I brought you a beautiful photography book with wonderful pictures of places you’ll see someday. And another book that tells you all about those places." Mrs. Jones handed me the two books, but held back a third. 
I flipped through the photography book recognizing some of the places from the postcards Mrs. Jones had sent after she moved away when her husband was transferred to Tucson, just after Pa forced me to quit school.
"And this here is a second year algebra book. You tore-through the first-year book so fast!" 
She was always talking like that, telling me how smart I was. Before the draught, I had worked the fields 12 hours a day with pa. School had become a luxury, so he pulled me out after ninth grade. It had infuriated Mrs. Jones, who had been my fifth-grade teacher. She sent the police over to find out why I wasn't in school. They came out into the field one day and talked with pa. I couldn't hear what they said, but it was clear that money had changed hands. The next day a social worker stopped by and pa walked her out to her car, and again, money changed hand. We didn't have enough for food that week. I never did return to school. When the Social Worker she sees me town now, she tells me how well I'm doing. 
Quitting school, though, I agreed with Pa. School bored me, and it did nothing to get me out of this town. But, Mrs. Jones never stopped teaching me and never stopped telling me I'd 'experience' other places, maybe even leave here someday. I didn’t see how, but more and more it was all I could think about. 
 Mrs. Jones whisked us away from the scotched earth around us to places of lush trees, oceans, lavish beaches, and abundance. She charmed us with stories of natives dancing around fires, and herds of animals pounding the earth. She choked up when she mentioned Michael, her husband, and how much he had liked this place or that. It had only been a year since his death. 
Mrs. Jones cleared her throat. "Tell me why your Pa doesn't want me teaching you anymore."
I looked at Ma, and Ma looked at her knitting. 
"He found my math book," I said caressing the cover of the new book. 
"Yes, and what dear? Don't hold out." 
"Pa said we don't accept charity, and it must be charity because I'm too stupid to work anywhere. He forbade me to see you again," I said. 
"Good god. He said that to you? You know that's not true." Mrs. Jones said, tossing her head back. "I suppose that includes a ban on your job helping me with the books?" 
"Yeah," I said.
"Christ, does he want you to become one of the overdose statistics skyrocketing in this town? I won't let that happen," said Mrs. Jones. "Well, we'll see about that." 
Ma and I shared furtive glances. 
"Please don't Mrs. Jones," I said to the book cover. 
She shifted her weight on the couch, leaned over and patted my thigh. "Don't you worry honey. He's just a big bully, and with 25 years of teaching under my belt, I know how to handle bullies." 
We sat in silence. Mrs. Jones flipped through the photography book, Ma worked on her knitting, and I read about the Terra-cotta Warriors in China. It had taken 700,000 laborers to chisel the specific facial features, expressions, hair styles and clothing on each of the 6000 figures. The magnificence of its size, power, and uniqueness stood in sharp contrast to our little town of 15,000 struggling farmers. A hollowness seeped throughout my chest. 
"Mrs. Jones? You're always talking about me getting out of here. Why did you stay?" 
"I didn’t stay, dear. I came back. Sometimes all we need is perceptive to see what you have here."
"The rate this town is suffocating--shops closing, people dieing and all, there won't be much to stay for," Ma said. 
I couldn’t imagine where else I might live, but dreaded being stuck here forever. And ma and Bee? They’d never leave, and I couldn’t leave without them. It was like I was one of those statues on a mountain top watching a moving train wind through the valley and disappear past the horizon. Children grew up, moved out, strangers move in, and others' lives moved on while I stood still.
Mrs. Jones gathered her purse and wiped her upper lip with a tissue tucked under the sleeve of her shirt. 
"I'll see you tomorrow then. We have a lot of books to catch up on." 
Ma's eyes darted at me. 
"I'll talk to your Pa on Sunday after church," Mrs. Jones said in the voice she used when talked to parents about their little hell-raising darlings during parent-teacher nights. "Don't you worry, my dears, he'll change his mind. You told me your Pa always leaves after breakfast on Saturday - so when he does, you come over and we'll get to work." </Text>

She is about to leave when she hears Bobby telling the Cartel about Pa's location. She gets an idea. *** Needs to leave message fro Aiden - that she has an idea and is on her way back. When she is leaving she runs into the guards again (the same ones that shot at her earlier) and begin to gang rape her. She gets confused. Her psyche fights with becoming Bee to shield Suzie from the rape, and staying Suzie to fight them off and continue with her plan (which causes even more dissonance because her known plan is to save Bee. Or was the plan to get her Pa all along?). If she chooses to stay Suzie, it forces her to denounce Bee. She decides to denounce Bee. *** How does she get away? Leave her for dead maybe tie her up to a cactus? after they get a call from the boss telling them to get back to the Motor home? Maybe she has the ATV again, and Aiden uses the LoJack to find her? - she never returned the keys. 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Under protest, Aiden left me alone with my thoughts. The wind kicked up from the southeast, threatening a storm. Grains of sand swirled around in chaos. I could be blown away in the storm. Become part of the soil, part of something good, something productive, something alive. 
I faced Ma's chair. Her knitting sat on the table next to it at the ready. On the needles, Ma had cast a shawl for me in purple and green. A shawl. I chuckled. The little free time she had, she spent knitting for me. Now she was dead. Tears streamed. Should I pray for her? 
Fingering the yarn evoked a rush of images: Ma cooking dinner, sewing clothes, knitting, working in the garden, shopping, putting away groceries. And other impressions not so pretty: bruises on her face, wet cheeks, her arm in a sling, fear in her eyes, desperation, resignation. Did she write about these things in her diary? I pulled it from my pocket and starting reading. 
The pages, now stained with my tears, sang with fear but even more with love. Love she had for Pa in their early years. She wrote of tender words, a loving touch, and a safety she didn't know existed. But soon after the words soured, a darkness moved in. Sprinkled in, flecks of joy derived from little things: shopping, tending the garden, chatting with Mrs. Jones, watching me read. The surrounding desolation, swept over me. 
Her scent from the chair, warmed my resentment that she left me, didn't fight back against Pa, didn't defend me from Pa. Through my tears, bitterness resigned to understanding. In the end, she had defended me to her death. And now I wished she hadn't defended me at all. I'd rather have her back. 
How would I get along without her, without Pa even? The wind howled through the window. The sand swirled on the porch. Each grain independent, yet being pushed along by an unseen force. Would that force whoosh me away? My thoughts whirled like the sand. "Everything's going to be okay, he'll never hurt you again." Ma's words that day she shot Pa. "You're strong. You can do anything you set your mind to. You can handle it all, even without Bee." The phrases Ma had repeated over and over throughout the year. I heard them when the babies died, when Pa beat me, when he pounded Bee, even when Ma's jaw was wired shut from Pa's blows she wrote them on paper. And I heard them again from Aiden today. 
“You're strong enough for all of it.” She believed in me. Mrs. Jones believed in me. Aiden believed in me. I dreamt all my life of living on my own, of needing no one, of getting away. But now with Ma dead, Pa gone, and Bee missing––was I whole enough to be on my own. And if I did nothing, if I gave into defeat, I was no better than Ma. 
A shiver rose up my spine. I had to save Bee. 
The storm rose in elevation and passed over, leaving nothing more than blown trash and a few cracked branches. Another cruel tease of rain from mother nature. 	With a renewed sense of purpose, I shook off my sadness and gathered my thoughts. But when I find Bee, what then? Would we stay in this house? This town? What would we do? Who would we be? Bee had always protected me, and now my need to protect her swamped me with confusion. Was I protecting her, or her—me? Was she better off without me? Without Pa here, finding Bee seemed to tug less at my soul. Maybe the Cartel didn't have her. They didn't have Ma, never did, even though I was so sure. Maybe I could survive without Bee. Should I let her go? Maybe she was safe. 
No, I had to be sure. Sticking my head in the sand was not an option. Finding Bee will be dangerous, but Ma cannot have died in vain. I must save Bee. For Ma. For me. 
Doodling on a napkin, I drew out the layout of the construction area. If Bee wasn't in the building behind the motor home or in the motor home, then there was one last place the Cartel could have her. She must be in the tool building. 
I'd have to go back, but driving the truck down the main road was too dangerous, even at night. I searched the pockets of my backpack. The keys to the ATV were under the papers I had taken from the motorhome, and the outside pouch still held Pa's loaded pistol.

With the ATV safely hidden in a thicket, I hiked in the last three-quarters of a mile. The camp was quiet. The men already out of sight, hard at work. I made it through the window of the tool building. Tools, machine parts, supplies, lumber all shuffled together. More of a storage dump than a productive space. 
"Bee? Bee, are you here?" I whispered, searching around palettes of materials. I kept my cell flashlight low to the ground, warding off prying eyes from the outside. 

Thirty minutes and two passes through the building later, Bee's absence pulled me to the ground. A sense of relief collided with a confusing sense of knowing she wouldn't be here. Maybe she was safe. Maybe she got away. 
"All hands on deck." The voice boomed from outside. 
"I'll round up the others," the second person responded. 
Shit. I didn’t have much time.

When I was clear of the camp, but within the patrolled perimeter, I raced the rising sun with my flashlight off and no moon. Just before I reached the ATV, I slammed into a refrigerator of a man, my body ricocheting to the ground and my back pack flew into the brush. I recognized his red-hair and enormous shoulders--the thief at Jeb's store. 
"Well, well, what have we here," said the hulk man. "Hey Jorge, look what I found." The man put his foot on my chest as he displayed me to the second man nearby. 
"Ain't she something," replied the other guy.
I broke free of his foot and was scrambling to my feet when a kick sent me down again.
“Yeah, and looks like someone's already softened her up for us." The second man said, examining the bruises on my face. 
The one man held my shoulders to the ground while refrigerator-man ripped at my pants. During a split second when my pants were clearing my feet, I kipped my lower body and freed my self. The second man jumped forward and stomped on my ribs. 
The men's laughter fueled a seething resentment deep within me. A third man appeared out of the darkness. Refrigerator man unbuckled his pants. The other two pinned me to the ground, only releasing their grip after their friend had worked his way in between my legs, crushing me with his weight. His pig-like thrusting and grunting forced air from my lungs, pounded my spine. 
The pain swirled with shame and collided with the realization that this was happening to me. Not Bee.
Refrigerator-man forced his tongue down my throat, his red hair scratching my face. The smell of sour body odor and the taste of rotten teeth overwhelmed me. I called out for Bee. 
"Oh, look. She’s calling for a friend." The laughter grew louder.
This couldn't be happening to me. I get hit, Bee gets raped. But I couldn’t fight. I was no match for the shear force of his weight. I can’t be here, this must be Bee. 
His junk hammered into me, jabbing my ribs into my lungs with each hit. Am I being raped? The bitter taste of familiarity lingered on my tongue. 
I've been here before. 
A darkness swept through me. Bee seeped forward, but when I opened my eyes, Pa on top of me. The pounding continued. Panting grew louder and faster. If this was Pa, then it must be Bee. 
Relief, then shame overcame me. Why would I push this on Bee? How could I? Refrigerator-man let out a sick, low-pitched grunt with one last deep thrust. He shuddered, then stillness. 
"Come on man, my turn," said the second man pushing refrigerator man aside. The Third guy still had me pinned. 
The second man mounted me. His sandy hair mushroomed into Pa's dark mass, his face melted into Pa's. 
When it was the third man's turn and Pa's face loomed over me again, memories flooded in. Words, once patronizing and demeaning, now echoed with love and concern: Bee's isn't here, she has to learn to live without Bee, Bee must leave - people's patience is going thin. But clearer than fresh rain water, Bobby's words sprinkled down around me, 'You've got to stop putting everything you can't handle on Bee'. 
"Ride her baby, ride." Chanted the two who had already had their turn.
The third man, whose face too had morphed in and out of being Pa, pumped faster. His drool dripped on my cheek.
Aiden's words echoed in my head, "When your Ma knew you were strong enough to accept the truth..." 
All the polite smiles when Bee's name was mentioned smacked me like doors opening and closing in a wind storm. They hadn't been genuine smiles at all, but condescending smirks of knowing something I didn't. The truth. The wind of memories calmed and left the door open to the bedroom where Pa had regularly pummeled Bee. 	Only it wasn't Bee on the bed. 
It was me. 
This humiliation. This total debasement. Only Bee could handle this. But Bee wasn't here. This was happening to me. It had been me all along.
I couldn't save Bee. I could have never saved Bee. It was my fractured self I had to save. There was no Bee. 
Voices blared through the men's radios, distracting the third enough that he went limp. 
"You bitch," he said as he drew back his fist and punched me. "You're spent. I can't get on with the likes of you." 
He eased back, admiring his handy work on my face. The other two had released their grip on me to get to their radios. I bucked. Hard. It sent the man on top of me forward, his head butting with the man who was holding my shoulders. The one of top of me landed on his elbows, his face just inches from mine. I bobbed my head up and grabbed his lip with my teeth and bit down hard enough to spit out flesh. His blood poured over my chin and down my neck. Refrigerator man laughed; tears trickled from his eyes. 
Grabbing his bloody mouth, the third man jerked back, freeing my legs. The man holding my shoulders flinched to avoid the spurting. Refrigerator-man slapped his thigh, howling even louder. In the chaos, I rolled away and launched down the banks of the dry river bed. Before I had stopped tumbling, a truck roared in and skidded to a halt in front of the men.
"Didn't you hear your radios?" A man shouted. "A part of the tunnel collapsed. It's got to be cleared. Shipments coming through. Let's go. Now."
I watched from the shadows as the third man scurried to pull up his pants. 
"Watch who your giving orders to," said the redheaded-refrigerator man. 
"Shit, sorry man, didn't see it was you. Your dad is pissed we need to get back."
 The three men sniped glances among themselves and the river bed. Refrigerator man shrugged and motioned for them to get in the truck. 
The truck drove off and silence encased me. Wrenching pain grew with each beat of my heart, but was no match for the sickening sensation of loss welling in my chest and radiating out. Pressure limited my breathing. A shroud of black grief veiled my eyes. </Text>

            <Synopsis>Sunday morning. Mrs J confront Pa about susie working for her. He relents. </Synopsis>
            <Text> The Sunday morning ritual had started. Ma begged pa to attend church with us. They yelled, then she bargained promising to service him later in return for him going with us. Pa relented. Ma’s only leverage was to service, but I knew if she didn’t, he’d do Bee. I hated him for this. 
Monsoon season should have been in full swing, but as the Sunday sun rose, the hope of a new day gave way to continued despair that turned to apathy fueled by a clear sky, and no rain in sight.
As we approached the church, Mrs. Jones cut us off and asked to talk to pa. A group of women stood nearby sewed gossip seeds to reap after mass. I slipped in with the woman but kept Mrs. Jones in my line of site. She was talking real firm with Pa. Even shook a pointed finger at him. I couldn’t hear everything, but based on the vein popping out on his neck, he wasn’t liking it. Some words… turning him in… bribes… shame, and I even thought I heard the words state police when she poked him with that pointed finger of hers. 
Pa glared daggers at her finger. There they stood. Toe to toe. Eyes locked. With Pa being six foot, and Mrs. Jones right at five foot - it was almost comical when Pa dropped his eyes first. I couldn’t believe it. I’d never seen Pa back down. The words "all right then" slithered between his gritted teeth. Mrs. Jones looked like an eagle about to dive on its prey with her squinted eyes, laser focused at pa. She gave a terse nod and walked away. 
Ma nudged my side, and I closed my gaping mouth. I tried to focus on the other women chatting away, but my mind lingered on pa and Mrs. Jones. 
Mrs. Jones came up beside ma and me. "Susan, may we talk?" I guess she wasn’t asking cause she took Ma’s arm and guided her clear of prying ears. She gestured for me to follow. 
"I had a very fruitful conversation with your husband, sweetie." 
Ma’s head whipped around to make sure pa was across the field. When she turned back, her eyes were as big as charcoal, her lower lip trembled. 
"Now, now, don’t you concern yourself with him." Mrs. Jones shook her head. "He’s agreed to let Suzie continue her education with me. I also told him Suzie was working for me and that I was paying her. He's also agreed that any money Suzie earns is hers to do with as she sees fit." Mrs. Jones nodded once, putting an end to things with pa. 
Ma looked scared but managed a smile. She took my arm in her hands and patted my forearm. "How… how d’you do that?" ma asked. I was asking––who'd pay for this? 
"Doesn’t matter now, it’s done. I expect to see her every Saturday and any afternoon she doesn't have chores to do, or other jobs to work, if you approve of course." 
Ma just looked at her. 
"Okay, then." Mrs. Jones turned to me. "And for you, girl, you review what I outlined for you this week." 
With her eyes averted, ma gave Mrs. Jones a quick hug, saying thank you through her tears. 
We watched ma walk away. 
"Oh, don’t you worry. She’s okay, honey," said Mrs. Jones. She put her arm around me. "She’s happy for you; a bit overwhelmed is all."

</Synopsis>
            <Text> I woke to zip tied to a chair. The plastic slicing my wrists and ankles. The rotten wood of the chair pinched the back of my legs. The acrid taste of blood mingled with the bad breath spewing from the man whose nose was almost touching mine. His lips were moving, spit flying, but I heard only the beating of my heart. I closed my eyes and shook my head hoping my ears would clear and the throbbing in my head might shake away.
"Who else knows our business?" The first man said. 
"What?" I said. 
"Who else knows?" The man smacked his palms against my ears while two other men circled around me. 
"I don't know what you're talking about." My ears rang. 
"If your Pa thought that sending you in would save him, he's wrong." 
Frantic, I struggled in my chair. "Where are Ma and Bee?"
"Mo," the first man turned to Gold-man, "what do you want us to do with her?" He walked over to Mo.
"Who is she going on about?" Mo's gold tooth sparkled as he spoke. He motioned the man back to me. 
"So, you're David's daughter, our blackmailer's helper," said El Brutal. "Has she said anything yet?" The other two men shook their heads. "Well, miss, you and your Pa have caused me a lot of trouble, but it ends here." He looked to Mo. "Do what you have to. Find David, find my money." 
Mo whispered to El Brutal as he left the room. Distracted by their conversation, I missed the first man raising his fist. Smack. His fist connect with my jaw. My head swiveled. Blood spewed from my mouth. A one-two punch. And the second landed square in my ribs. In the background, Gold-man's grin blurred into a dripping, clown-face as my vision tried to refocus. 
"Pussy. You can't even make a girl cry," said Mo, pushing the first man away. He shifted his weight, it was subtle, but I knew that move anywhere. Time slowed. As he drew his elbow back, I rocked the chair. Crashing to my side, his fist flew past where my face had just been. Gravity took over and toppled Mo's body over me. 
Laughter exploded from the background, and what little dignity Gold-man had left was eroded by his lame attempt at unscrambling his legs woven through the chair legs and falling all over again. I thrashed underneath him. One of the arms on the chair had cracked off, freeing one arm. 
The other men chanted, "Fight! Fight!" 
A glint of red fell from Mo's pocket. Pushing against his legs with my foot, I snatched it. 
"Fight! Fight!" 
Gold-man was clear of the chair. 
"Fight! Fight!" 
I hid the red object in my balled fist as best I could.
Mo grabbed my leg and pull me toward him, breaking the leg from the chair. He wobbled but regain his forward motion. My free leg kicked at him, clipping his head. 
Gold-man was on his feet rubbing his head. Laughter once again filled the room. Mo let out a growl, like a tiger protecting his heard. The laugher stopped. The silence, like the silence after a dead baby is born just before the realization set in prefaced his charge on the lesser males. His rage fueled by sour taste of humiliation.
Mo bowled over the two men triggering a tornado of flying fists, legs, head butts. Gold-man would win this fight, if only to restore his dominance, and once he did, I'd be next. I opened my first to see the red object in my hand. It was one of those Swiss-army knifes. 
As the fight ensured, I fumbled with the knife and unfolded one of the "knifes" only to realize it was the small bottle opener. It might still work. Angling it between my wrist and the zip tie, I pulled. It flipped out of my hand and fell to the ground. Still on my side, I shimmied over to it. I tried again. 
Snap. The zip tie sprung away from my wrist. I froze, zeroed in on the men, but they were still holding their own against the raging inferno they called Mo. I reached over and snapped ties around my ankles. 
One man was out for the count. Mo pummeled the other nonstop. It wouldn't be long before he turned his attention my way. I slipped out the window opposite the door, and crouched down underneath the window to orient myself. The room behind the motor home, the very room where I was sure they had been holding Ma and Bee. 
With limited options, running not being one of them, I worked my way towards the motorhome, and pulled back the skirt around the bottom of it. In one motion rolled underneath and replaced the skirt right behind me. A few pack-rats scurried away. 
"Julio, Marcus, Joe––everyone––get out here. Now," Mo screamed. 
Shuffling chairs and quick footsteps reverberated from the floor of the motor home overhead. Through a slight crack, two people approached from the motor home. The woman wore a cop's uniform, her super short hair cut and scar on her left cheek left an indelible impression. Only one man may emerged from the building where I had been held. I wondered if the second man was dead. 
"Find her. Now." Mo sounded frantic. Pairs of steel-toe boots spanned out from the motor home.
"But Mo, we're distributing payroll," said a man's voice. "The men will be out in less than an hour and they'll want their pay." 
"I don't give a shit. Find her," said Mo. 
I laid my head on the hard desert floor covered in cactus needles and bits of trash the pack rats had accumulated. My jaw throbbed, my chest crackled with each breath, but I was alive. Watching the men run away from the motorhome and towards the perimeter, I listened up through the floor of the motor home––the only other place they could hide Ma and Bee. </Text>

            <Title>Character Freewrite guidelines</Title>
            <Text>Start with your character’s flaws and vulnerabilities. Ask yourself what will make them afraid or mean. What will make them strike out or run away? What would make even your nicest character hurt someone else? Where have they been hurt? How did they manage to hide or harden the wound? What happens when something rips away the protective covering of that injury?

in first person from their viewpoint, as if they were writing their own diary. When beginning a character, I just write from that character’s viewpoint, but later when trying to understand motivation, I will give a question to write about, such as “Why did you kill Jake?”

Have your character write about his/her obsession. 	
What do your characters want more than anything? What are their dreams? What are their terrors?  

Next, ask why your character’s friends love her/him. Try freewriting from two or three different friends’ points of view. Then, write a conversation between two friends about your character. This allows you to see your characters as other characters view them, both positively and negatively. I guarantee that, if you do this right, you will surprise yourself with what you will learn about your characters.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Looks for Ma </Title>
            <Synopsis> (still at crash site) Suzie finally decides to look for Ma. She finds the engraved shovel, and six grave-like sites. Hears blasting in the distance. Barely gets out of there before a huge dust storm hits. Close to home she finds one of her chickens dead on the road - someone cut of its legs. 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>I stood in the ditch, unsure of what to do next. If Ma went away on her own, I’d leave her be, and keep my promise to God so she’d be happy. But if she needed help... 
My stomach felt queasy. What if I found her? What if she didn’t want me to find her? Was I that worthless? Isolation suffocated me, abandonment shamed me. 
Pa was gone, but why would I care? Pa was a monster. And Ma? She allowed him to be a monster. Didn’t she care Pa was doing Bee? Why did she let it happen? But he was my Pa. And she was my Ma. 
Pa had taught me how to drive a tractor, and plant a field. Because of him, I thew a punch stronger than most, and held my own in most fights. And Ma? She got it worse than me. Did I allow Pa to beat her? Maybe I deserved what I got because I didn’t protect Ma enough. 
Although glad Bee wasn't here, I was beginning to worry she had been gone too long. She was old enough to take care of herself, but I worried. Where did she go? Maybe for the best, she didn't need this kind of stress. But she would insist I look for Ma, and the only thing worse than disappointing Bee, was disappointing Ma. 
"Damn it." I slammed the truck door. 
Ma couldn’t have gone far. I surveyed the nearby grounds. My throat tightened at the sight of drag marks and footprints heading away from the crash. I gasped for air. Twenty yards out, they stopped. A scuffle, maybe, twigs bent, dirt mussed. I surveyed the area. Who had been here? 
I searched about a quarter mile from the road. Brush wasn’t too thick but thick enough for Ma to hide. But nothing. My mouth went dry. No sign of her. No patch of disturbed dirt the size of Pa. Not even that old shovel, the one with my made-up family crest that I had burned into the handle during my possessive days as a kid. That shovel should be here, I'd seen Ma toss it into the truck when she had driven off with Pa's body. 
I searched further in, the dense brush scratching my legs, but still nothing. But then, over the rise, the thicket opened up into a field of dry grass. From the high-ground, a large patch of grass stomped down, about 30 yards out caught my eye. With my next step, deep within the grass, a flock of quail squawked and rushed the sky. I jumped, my heart raced. Once recovered, I chuckled at myself. 
The adrenalin quickened my step. The dry grass raked against my legs as it swayed in the wind. Focused on the flattened area, I moved towards it. The winds swirled. Clouds gathered. First sign of rain in months. I needed to hurry. Unless it came on slow, a flash food might whip through and wash away my truck in the river bottom. Best case, I’d be stuck here for hours, even days, before it cleared enough to get the pickup out. Worse case, it could wash me away. 
I reached the flattened grass. A rectangle, about six feet by three feet with fresh dirt on top. Was this Pa? 
The wind whistled through the trees. 
This didn’t make sense. The storm-scented air filled my nostrils. From this vantage point, I spotted three more mounds, hidden in plain sight amongst the grasses. 
I sprinted to each one, not sure what I’d find. I recalled the babies’ graves. What would I find in these graves? A few had been here awhile; brownish green grass about three inches tall withered on top. One mound looked newer for the sprouts barely poked out. 
I’d gone full circle returning to the first grave I'd found. With my hands on my knees, I caught my breath looking at the dirt. This grave was recent. 
Thunder rumbled through the valley. 
Should I dig up these graves? Was Pa in one? Was Ma? 
The sudden chill of the on-coming storm dwarfed the heat of my concern.
I paced around the first grave, corralling my thoughts, but a loud boom from across the field distracted me. It must have been thunder. But the sky responded with a raucous thunder that convinced me the first boom was not thunder at all. What was that? I started in that direction, but the first drizzle dotted the fresh grave, forcing me to reconsider. The winds picked up even more, dust swirled everywhere, turning me towards home. 
I jogged through the field trying to protect my shins as best I could. The time between drops decreased. When I entered the thicket, the drizzle turned to light rain. At first, the ground refused to soak up the water, but it wouldn’t take long for it to change its mind and drink in this life-giving miracle. 
I ran the rest of the way, and made it to the truck in 30 minutes. 
 I jumped in and prayed for it to start. 
For once God listened. The truck started right up, but I guess I should have been more clear in my prayer. The tree held tight to the front bumper, spinning my tires. I slammed my palm against the steering wheel. 
In between the thunder roars, more muted booms echoing in the distance. I leaped out, hustled around to the front, and jumped on the bumper. It released its hug with the tree, but the tires sunk more into the soft dirt. The tires needed something other than sand to grab. With my shirt dotted with rain, I checked the bed. God anticipated my need, because there laid a five-foot wood plank. 
I jammed the plank under the tire, thankful for the truck's odd angle that raised the tire about an inch from the ground. 
It was still early afternoon, but the dark clouds drowned the sun into mimicking early evening. My legs slid onto the cheap vinyl seats, patched and re-patched over the years. I threw the truck in reverse and nudged the gas pedal. The tires grabbed the plank hauling the truck out of the ditch. 
"Thank you, God," I sighed and made my way onto the road. 
Around the corner, through the brush, I spotted a ball of dust coming toward me from the opposite direction. Bobby’s warning echoed in my ears. With the truck in neutral, I guided it into a wide ditch with slopping sides and rolled behind some brush and Palo Verde trees. I turned off the engine, cocked the shotgun, and hunched down spying the road. 
A new, gold, four-door, 2004 Ford dually sped by with a dark four-door Chevy beater choking on its dust. They never slowed. 
Half tempted to follow, I thought better of it. When my pulse resumed to normal, I pulled onto the road.
The sight of the gold truck plagued me. Where had I seen it before? Scenes from previous days played out. Jeb’s store. That was it. The gold dually had been outside of Jeb’s store several times in the last few months. 
The storm cleared as fast as it started. Mother Nature teasing the farmers. Not enough rain to save any crop, but enough to muck up the windshield. 
I turned on the road that led to our driveway. Up ahead I saw Betty, our cow, grazing in a field to my left. I was sure she had been in the barn when I left. I looked to the sky. The thunder might have spooked her, and she had bolted from the barn. 
"What the…?" I hit the brakes. 
One of our hens roosted in the middle of the road. The screech of the brakes caused it to flap its wings wildly, but it didn’t go anywhere, it just sat there, panicked. Confused, I got out of the truck and fully expected it to skitter away, but it didn’t. The hen groaned a low, gurgling sound. I squatted to pick her up. 
Then I saw it. She couldn’t move.
Someone had cut off her legs.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Leads Cartel and FBI to the shack </Title>

Informs FBI about the body (her Ma) in the shack and tells them the cartel will be there to clean up the mess.  Also tells FBI that they have a mole. </Synopsis>
            <Text>I replayed the scene over and over while driving. My racing heart caused me to want to speed down the road, but I tempered myself. Last thing I needed was more attention. 
Was Aiden okay? Was Jeb? Did I kill Pa? What now? Aiden was right, we needed evidence. 
Evidence. 
I pulled over. Grabbed my backpack and snatched the papers I had taken from the safe inside the motorhome. Scanning each page, I flipped through the stack. Dates, times, locations, plans. What did it all mean? Was it enough? 
I needed help. But not the FBI. Not yet.
News would soon reach the Cartel that Pa, Jeb, and Aiden had been shot, and in Jeb's store no less. If Pa wasn't dead, he would be soon. Main street would be crawling with cops, and maybe not the ones owned by the Cartel. El Brutal would steer clear of Jeb's until he had control of the scene with his people. 
I made a u-turn back to the store. Six blocks away, I drove into the alley and parked Aiden's truck. On a napkin, I wrote a note, then walked to the main street. I lingered around the corner with my head down and hoodie cloaking my face. A cartel look-out would be near, but I didn't expect Mo. My luck was changing. 
Mo's gold truck idled a couple of blocks from the police perimeter being formed. He was on his phone, waving his arms. His eyes focused on Jeb's store. I slid back to the alley and walked passed Mo's truck. I angled back to the main street and snuck up behind his truck. 
His arms were still waving, his voice angry.
I crept up to his window. 
"What the hell?" Mo said dropping his phone. 
"I gotta message for your boss," I said, pressing the barrel of my pistol against his cheek. I dropped the napkin in his lap. 
"Now, unless you want this pristine truck of yours to look like Swiss cheese, you stay put." 
 I walked backwards until clear of the truck. As I turned, the truck door opened. I spun around and put three shots to his tailgate. 
"Damn you. You're dead," Mo said, pulling himself back into this truck and slamming the door. 

From Aiden's pickup, I called the FBI. "Agent Mark Delacroix, please. It's an emergency." They patched me through.
"Delacroix here." 
"There's a body in a shack. Cartel’s work. Directions are on your phone. Key cartel members will be there soon to dispose of it." 
"Who is this?" 
"Don't go yourself, but send someone you trust, you have a mole. Go now." 
I hung up the phone. 
My stomach turned at my callousness. Using my Ma's death like that. But if it helped put an end to things, she’d be okay with it. 
Next, I called Mrs. Jones. 

"Suzie again?" said El Brutal, wondering if Mo had been drinking. 
"She dropped a note on my lap, and shot up my truck," said Mo. 
"Well?'
"Well, three shots in my tailgate." 
"Not your damn truck, you idiot. The note?" said El Brutal. 
"It says, 'Your money is in the shack off old State Route 63, about three miles off the road."
"Damn that girl," said El Brutal.
"It's in the crawl space," continued Mo. 
"What are you waiting for? Go get it." </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie dupes Bobby 
 </Title>
            <Synopsis>Suzie pushes forward with her plan. Bobby's pressures her to tell him where the Cartel stash is. His words confirm that he doesn't know Pa is alive. Bobby feigns wanting to work together, but Suzie realizes he is just out for himself and will take the stash and run. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Suzie immediately smelled Bobby's stench as she walked to the house. Bobby's duffel bag was open, and clothes tossed about the third bedroom. He had left a mess in the kitchen, and the toilet seat up. When I passed Ma's room, I noticed the bed was mussed up, her closet in disarray––same in my room. In the kitchen , the food in the cabinets was shuffled about. Bobby had been busy. 
I checked my money-stash under the bed, Bobby hadn't found that. The barn was next. Misery sat untouched with the money and drugs hidden in her tires. Bobby's search had yielded nothing. 
Sitting at the kitchen table with a pad of paper and a pen, I wrote down everything I knew so far.
	1. Cartel was building a Casino. 
	2. Cartel used the Casino to hide the building of a drug tunnel. 
	3. Aiden was some sort of runner for the Cartel, but maybe also working against them with the FBI. 
	4. FBI doesn't yet know about the other stores in the money laundering scheme, but Aiden and Mrs. Jones do. 
	5. Bobby is trying to find the drugs and money to save himself from the Cartel 
	6. Pa was alive - what is he up to - what will the Cartel do when / if they find out
	7. No sign of Ma or Bee 
Just like a farmer who assumes the weather will cooperate, the bank won't call-in the loan, and that prices will hold until picking season; I had to assume a few things too. In thinking about what I didn't know, I decided to believe: likely Ma was in that building behind the motorhome, and Bobby and the Cartel didn't know Pa was alive. The last two assumptions related to Pa were pretty likely, but the one about Ma was little more than a hope. 
The door flew open. "Where have you been?" Bobby demanded sporting a bruise the shape of Texas on his left cheek. //Todo/Validate against Bobby 2nd Cartel encounter that left cheek makes sense. 
"I never agreed to you staying here. Take your stuff and leave," I said folding the list and stuffing it in my pocket. 
"Like hell. You're going to take me to the Cartel's stuff if its the last thing you do. I know you're lying to me about not knowing where it is." 
"Cartel boss give you that bruise?" 
"Play time's over Suzie, things are getting serious. Now tell me where it's at?" 
"Getting serious? It wasn't serious when they took Ma, then Bee? But now it's serious because they got to you?" I glared at him, daring him to hit me, so I could whop him. 
"Your Pa was right, you're more stubborn than Misery on a cold day." 
I flinched when he mentioned Misery. Does he know? 
"Either I return the goods, or give them your Pa, if not, I'm a dead man. And as you know, I can't exactly give them David," Bobby blathered on in true Bobby fashion. "Damn him, this Cartel gig was the best thing to happen to me in a long time. I really could have been something with them. But no, David's taken that from me too." 
Bobby didn't know Pa was alive. 
He raged on, "Oh don't worry, you'll know when I'm going to hit you." He must have mistaken my flinch as anticipation of a slug. Bobby closed his eyes and took a breath. "Listen we both want the same thing. If you really don't know where it is, let's work together and find it." 
I considered his angle. He couldn't really think the Cartel would allow him, or me for that matter, to live after they got their stuff back? He wasn't that dumb. The money could solve a lot of problems for him: gives him revenge on Pa, and gives him enough money to get the hell of out of dodge. 
"Yea, and what are we going to do when we find it." 
Bobby hesitated just long enough to confirm he had no intention of returning the goods to the Cartel.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Party scene </Title>
            <Synopsis>(Saturday - a couple weeks after they walked home) At the welcome home party for Aiden, Suzie runs into Maricella who confirms that her Pa (Gilberto - who was interviewed in prior scene/prologue) is missing and he too was going out at night. Suzie learns that several other men are missing as well. Suzie also talks with Aiden about why he returned after college, and Aiden says to help his Dad who is in trouble. [Add interaction wtih Jo}</Synopsis>
            <Text>Saturday rolled around and Jo was good to her word. She had a party to welcome back Aiden, even thought he had been back for four months. Jo waited until their new pool was completed. She almost canceled it because of the funeral, but then decided we needed something happy. 
The Manwell’s ranch style home sprawled twice the size of ours. Four bedrooms and a big kitchen and dining room surrounded by freshly planted grass that edged the cool-deck around the pool. It looked luxurious to me. The stark contrast of the surrounding dry brown desert and the luscious green grass reeked of money. And the water required to keep it green in the middle of the desert, while farmers lost their farms, screamed wasteful, if not deadly. 
"Where’s your pa?" I asked Jo when I arrived. 
"Don’t worry, he’s at the store. Says he trusts us to keep things sane." Jo’s rolled her eyes. 
"So, then, he doesn’t know you're with me," I said. 
We both cracked up.
"Aiden, look who’s here." Jo shouted across the yard in Aiden’s direction. "Ut-oh, look at you. Blushing." Jo poked me in the rigs. 
"Stop," I said. "I’m not blushing. Besides, he doesn’t want to see me." 
"Of course he does. Look here, he comes," Jo said. 
"Hey, Suzie. Glad you made it," Aiden said. 
I nodded. 
Jo winked at me and spun towards the pack of cackling girls near the food table.
"Want something to drink," Aiden asked. 
"Sure," I said. 
We walked over to the drink table in silence. Knowing he was eyeing Bee, I kept my eyes towards the ground. He popped the top on a can of diet Coke and handed it to me. Then did the same for himself. 
"Food?" he said. 
"Uh, no thanks." Thinking I couldn’t manage the can of soda and a food plate at the same time. 
"Let’s sit over there. I’d love to hear how your year went. Every time I was home, you seemed to be busy," he paused, "I’ve missed you." 
I looked around, but Bee wasn’t there. 
"Who? Me?" I said when I turned back to him. 
"Yes, you." Aiden said. 
I had learned my lesson with Aiden, Bee should be here. 
We sat on a rocking bench under the large Mesquite tree that offered us shade and a bit of privacy from the crowd. Taylor Swift on the radio. The girls near the table signing along with Jo's voice booming loudest. A slight breeze and the cold Coke made the outdoor summer party palatable. 
Neither of us seemed to have any words. We rocked in silence. It didn’t feel awkward. I breathed in the stillness. 
"What happened to us?" Aiden cleared his throat and looked at the ground. "I never understood."
I looked at him, but he didn’t look up. His light brown hair, shorter and combed back now instead of in his face, Justin-Beiber-style in his younger years. He had gotten older, his skin tan and tough from the sun, but his hands still soft. Gentle. I remember gentle. 
"Your hair looks good like that," I said. 
He looked up at me with a quizzical look. "Okay. I get it." He sounded defeated. 
"Listen. Can I ask you something?" I said. 
"Sure? Anything?" He perked up. 
"Why’d you return? You were out. Why come back?" 
"It’s a long story." 
"I’m not going anywhere," I said. 
"Well. Let’s just say that Pa needs me right now." He looked around then whispering he said, "He got himself in a bit of trouble." 
"Trouble?" I said. 
"Shhhh." He whipped his head around again. "The town’s changed. He got in too deep, but we’re getting him out."
"We? Who’s we? You and Jo?" 
"No, Jo knows nothing about this. I really shouldn’t be talking at all." 
"What kind of trouble?" I asked. 
"Money trouble. Let’s leave it at that. Please." 
I studied him for a moment, and thought about the store’s books, the sudden jump in revenue and the strange investments.
"Store seems to be doing well, with all those new construction people coming in and buying stuff," I said. 
"Yea, I guess." Aiden swatted a fly.
"Seems like that one guy, the guy with that brand-new gold, Ford dually must have money," I said, trying to be causal. 
Aiden looked at me. A veil of fear crossed his eyes. He took a breath, then shook his head as if shaking off a bad feeling and stood. 
"Hey man, great to have you home." A blond-hair blue-eye man trotted over and shook Aiden's hand. 
"Hey Sammy," Aiden looked as if he had beamed in from another universe. He introduced us. 
"Ah ha! This is Suzie." 
"Come on." Aiden grabbed my hand. "Let’s go join the party."
"You two go ahead, I see Maricela. I haven’t seen her since her pa went missing." 
Marcela looked sad. No surprise though. 
"Maricela, I didn’t expect to see you here. Any news about your pa?" I said. 
"No news," she shook her head. 
"Your pa’s a good man, he wouldn’t just leave, you know that, right? They’ll find him." Her family was from Mexico. His parents had waited years to get into the US legally. She and her older bother Angel were born in the States. Back in school, her ma and pa were the ones who stood and clapped the hardest at the school play, cheered the loudest from the sidelines, and always showed up for Parent-Teacher day. The entire family attended church every week. If you saw Maricela and Angel on the street, they could be mistaken for homeless dressed in rags. But on Sunday, God’s day as her pa said, the Romero family honored God in their finest with Maricela in a fluffy pink dress, and Angel in a suit and tie. Used clothes from Goodwill, but their finest, none the less. 
I wasn’t sure what to say. Her Pa had been missing for weeks now. I rubbed her shoulder and let the silence soothe. 
"You were good to us. Pa always liked you. Especially after that day you showed us that the bosses were cheating us in the field. After that, after you got banned from the field, whenever we got paid, he'd say—Thank God for that Bannon girl."
My checks flushed. "Your pa was the hardest worker out there." 
Maricela glanced around. She took a step closer and whispered, "He’s not the only one." She looked at me as if questioning if I got it. 
"Others are missing?" I matched her volume. 
"Yeah. I ran into Daniel, Margaret's boy, the other night, he’s trying to get on the police force, you know. He was asking me a bunch of questions: Did pa have any work? Did he go out at night? Did he say anything about working with his pa or Jorge’s. He finally told me they were missing to." She glanced around again. "All in the last three months." 
"He thinks they’re connected?" 
"Yeah, all three of them got jobs doing construction work. They all worked at night."
"My pa too." I said. 
Maricela’s eyes opened wide enough to see the white all around. "Your Pa’s missing too?"
"No. No." I hadn’t realized I said that out loud. "I mean, my pa worked at night too. Comes back before sun up covered in dirt. He didn't know that I knew though." It just came out; I searched her face to see if she realized I had talked about him in the past tense.
I continued, hoping to distract,"What do the police say?" 
"Nothing. They say men leave their families all the time. Say there's nothing to investigate." Maricela's eyes started to tear. "Ma’s worried sick. With all the shootings in Agua de vida, she’s afraid it might have spilled over." 
"Agua de vida? I know it’s just across the border, but isn’t that all drug related?" 
"I guess..." 
I stopped her. "They’ll turn up." 
Neither of us believed that.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>I felt a rush of anger when I heard Bobby's Camaro racing down the main road. What did he want now? First Aiden, now Bobby. 
"I don't have time for you," I said as walked out onto the porch. 
"What's with the dead chicken in the middle of the road? And the mailbox? What happened here?" 
"You tell me?" I said, frustrated with his games. "Your nighttime friends paying a visit of sorts, I guess."
"You saw them do this?" Bobby asked. 
 "No, just the path of destruction they left in their wake." 
"They must know." Bobby sat on his bumper, slumped over with his head in his hands.
"Who must know what?" 
"That David’s dead." Bobby’s voice, barely audible. 
"The Cartel doesn't cares if he's alive or dead, but they do care the stuff Pa stole from them. You part of that?" 
"What? David stole from the cartel? You got to be kidding me?" Bobby, up now, paced the length of the car. "Wait. Who told you about the Cartel?" 
"Why, you look like you're gonna puke. What does it matter who told me. And yeah, Pa stole from them, and they want it back, or else." I swiped my finger across my throat. 
"What'd he take? Where is it?" Beads of sweat emerged on his forehead. 
"Thanks for your concern. Questions you should have the answers to. Now tell me, what’s at the old mine. Any buildings? Anything you know." I headed back into the house. 
"I told you that road doesn't interest you, or the mine. I told you to forget it all," Bobby followed me, "and you shouldn’t even mention the Cartel. You don’t understand what you’re saying. Now forget everything."
"Take a breath, dude, and listen to me." I pushed him into a chair. Bobby's word vomit stopped as I recapped the day. The legless chicken, Betty, the chicken coop, the mailbox, the barn, the house. With each revelation, Bobby turned greener. 
"Yeah, and let’s not forget the threat." I read him the note. 
"...say goodbye. You have 48 hours." 
The words lingered like four-day-old fish. His eyes locked on mine at first, but then the veil of deception dropped. I ran my fingers through my hair as if putting it in a ponytail, but instead let it fall to my shoulders. 
"Is that all?" Bobby squinted. 
I shrugged. 
"Did they see you?" Bobby paced again. "How many were in the truck? How did they not see you?" 
"No, I told you I wasn’t here when they did this," I gestured around the room. 
"Not then, you dimwit." Bobby’s face flushed red. "On the way back from fetching your truck. On that road. Did you pass anyone? Did they see you?" 
I smelled his desperation, his panic, but wasn't sure why. Something was up. 
"No, they didn’t see me. This dimwit pulled off into a ravine and hid when the gold truck and a car drove passed. What’s the big deal?" I glared at him, trying to figure his angle. 
"Maybe they saw you? A man in a car, right? One of those BMWs, right?" Bobby searched the refrigerator. "Damn it. Why is there no beer in this house?" 
"BMW? No, an old Chevy beater." I said peering into the refrigerator; there should be beer in there. 
"Wait. You didn’t see a dark BMW? How did you not pass it? You followed me, right? You had to see it." Bobby paced, sat down, got up, and paced some more as he talked. Bobby 1st Cartel encounter
"Not right away." I said, clearing my throat. "I had trouble getting the truck out of the ditch. And thanks for helping with that, by the way." 
"Okay, okay. So you didn’t see the BMW, but a truck and a car passed you. How long after I left?"
A light bulb when off for me. "Are you trying to come up with an alibi?" I scoffed. "Did you steal from them too?" 
"Don’t say steal. And no, I didn’t steal anything. As far as your Pa goes...well, we can’t ask him now, can we? Gawd! You don’t steal from these people." He dug his fingernails into the palm of his hand. "You just let me handle this. Now where is their stuff? I’ll get it back to them, and everything will be just fine. I can handle everything..." 
"For the third time, I don’t know what they're looking for. What's up with you?"
"Yea, yea. You have no idea what it is. Okay." He looked as if wheels were spinning in his head; his eyes darted like pinballs. "This is what we'll do. I’ll move in here, make sure this doesn't happen again. Susan will be proud I'm stepping up. Then, I’ll handle everything." Bobby stood straighter. 
Is he trying to impress me with this big-uncle act? I saw through him. Moving in gave him the chance to search the place again. He hoped to find their stuff. If that didn't work, I'm sure he'll watch me like a hawk, hoping I'll lead him to it. 
"You can’t fix anything. And since when do you care what Ma thinks? Besides, Ma will never see your heroics, they took her as collateral." 
"What the hell’s co-lat-er-al?" 
"Good lord, you are an idiot. It's a trade. You get that?" I slowed my speech to match his brain power, "We get Ma back, when-they-get-their-goods-back."
Bobby belched and his hand flew up to his mouth.

Start with your character’s flaws and vulnerabilities. Ask yourself what will make them afraid or mean. What will make them strike out or run away? What would make even your nicest character hurt someone else? Where have they been hurt? How did they manage to hide or harden the wound? What happens when something rips away the protective covering of that injury?

in first person from their viewpoint, as if they were writing their own diary. When beginning a character, I just write from that character’s viewpoint, but later when trying to understand motivation, I will give a question to write about, such as “Why did you kill Jake?”

have your character write about his/her obsession. 	What do your characters want more than anything? What are their dreams? What are their terrors?  

Next, ask why your character’s friends love her/him. Try freewriting from two or three different friends’ points of view. Then, write a conversation between two friends about your character. This allows you to see your characters as other characters view them, both positively and negatively. I guarantee that, if you do this right, you will surprise yourself with what you will learn about your characters.


Bobby Talking 
Nothing comes easy for me. In fact, not much comes my way at all.  Sure I'm a good mechanic, but living here in farming country, farmer can't pay a lot for my services.  Besides, one day I'm going to make it rich.  I see those city boys, wearing suits and ties, driving fancy cars with a busty woman in the passenger seat.  I tried several things over the years, but nothing as panned out.  

My daddy was mean, rotten to the core.  Beat me and my sister regular like.  I could get away with more than my sister Susan.  I hated my daddy but was good at pretending I liked him.  I knew how to get on his good side. But I still got my share of beatings.  He might have been mean, but he had one of the most productive farms in the area.  When he died, he up and gave the farm to my sister's husband, David.  That SOB didn't leave me a thing, 'cept his tools. Right there in his will, for everyone to hear, he said I was a lazy fuck and wouldn't never make anything of myself even if I tried.  The tools would allow me to make a living, if, as he stated, I ever got off my ass.  

David and I have been friends since forever.  I spent more time at David's house than I ever spent at mine.  We were friends, but after he got the farm, I didn't look at him that way any more.  I resented him.  He'd tell you we were friends, but that's just cause I pretend well.  He only married my sister cause daddy promised him the farm if he did.  He didn't even like farming.  She had been dating Jeb, but daddy put a stop to that threatening to take all his business away, and promising David the farm.  Sure, David ran the farm for my daddy.  Hired the me during picking season, kept them in line, handled the money.  Sometimes I worked for him - got that? - I worked for him on my own daddy's land.  Humiliating.  He never gave my sister even as much as a second look, but jumped at the chance to marry her after being promised the land. 

Daddy didn't give him the house though, left that and two acres to Ma, with some money - just enough for her to drink herself to death three years later.  Turns out she sold the place to XXX before she died, so I got nothing from her either. 

So Susan, the bride, moved in with David into the Foreman's shack on the edge of the farm.  They called it a three bedroom house, but with only 1200 square feet, it wasn't much.  It was over 60 years old and looked older, never got much maintenance.  I'll never live like that. Trapped in a house the size of a shoe box, with the panel and roof falling down around you.  Makes me barf just thinking about it.  I'd rather sleep in my sleeping bag, under the star than live like that. 


I never saw it growing up, but turns out David was a mean as my daddy.  He took to carrying on the beatings with Susan and his kid Suzie.  Did even worse things to the kids. But he as alway good to me, until he took the farm - he didn't have to - he could have done the right thing and said, here Bobby, it's really your, you take it.  But no, he just took and and had the gaul to tell me I could work there anytime, and he pay me top dollar.  How gracious of him. The fuck.  

I learned a lot from David.  He got me stated as a mechanic.  Said it was something I could do until I struck it rich.  He was always making fun of me.  But that didn't stop me from following him around like some sick puppy.  He arranged for my first lay, albeit he paid for it.  Said it was better that way. I had my first drink with him, and my first hangover (and many to follow). We stole together, we started brawls together, we did everything together.  He was like a brother to me, until he took the farm.

One day, he'll get his comeuppins. And when that day comes I won't feel bad.  Maybe I'll even get the farm back. But by that time, I'll already be rich, and I can have them Mexicans do all the work. 

Lately I've been working for the Mexican Chinolas Cartel.  Now those guys know how to live.  And boy do they have money.  Some of the top guys are Mexican and some are white. So I figure, if I play my cards rights, I can charge right to the top and be one of them big wigs.  I'll get my own fancy car, and the women will flock around me. I won't need David, or the farm.  I'll be living large.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie ups the stakes for the Cartel</Title>
            <Synopsis>Suzie contacts (via note written by what looks like her Pa) the Cartel again and threatens more stores will go down if they don't release Ma and Bee. She makes it look like the note is from her Pa. Bobby is there when the note is received and is shocked to see the note is from her Pa, and confirms that to the Cartel. Cartel now thinks Bobby was lying to them about David being dead. Note also threatens to tell the Feds about the tunnel here, and the one in Nogalas (which Suzie learns about from papers in the safe when she stole the money). Angel (Gilberto's son who is "missing") helps with plot.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Two pieces of paper sat in front of me on the table: a letter Pa had written to Ma years ago, and a black page I used to practice writing in Pa's hand. After an hour, I penned the real note. 
 I warned you. The dry cleaners is just the first. Return Susan and Bee XXX, to the diner by noon, [//todo/timeline - deliver Ma and Bee by noon at the diner] or your laundering sites will be washed away. Any retribution will be met with outing your stash house, and the tunnel. [//Todo/need something earlier that is specific to David, so when referenced in the 2nd threat, they believe it's David.]
I enlisted Angel Romero to drop the note in Gold-man's truck out at the mine. Angel had been working a the mine to help support his Ma and his sister after his Pa's disappearance. He had suspected the Cartel has something to do with his Pa going missing. His Ma didn't know a thing, thought Angel was working at the gas station's midnight shift. Although they did need the money, Angel had really signed-on with the Cartel hoping to find his Pa, or at least find out what happened to him. Last week, Maricela, his sister, had followed me out of the Corner Store and begged me to stop Angel. She was terrified she'd lose him too. 
Earlier today, I offered to pay him to drop the note and set off the truck's alarm, ensuring Gold-man would run out and find the note right away. He flatly refused the cash. Now, with the note in hand, he left like a man on a mission. 
 
 The side door opened. Angel strutted in. "It worked. Mo charged out of the motorhome as soon as his truck alarm started blaring. He was mad," Angel laughed. "Took him a while to see the note, but after he read it, I thought he was going to have a heart attack." 
"Yeah, I bet," I smiled, visualizing Mo squirming. "Wonder what surprised them most, that it mentioned the other stores, the stash houses, or the tunnel?" 
"El Brutal and Bobby followed Mo out. Mo shouted at Bobby, 'You know anything about this?'" Angel did his best Mo impression puffing up his chest, standing on a chair to look bigger, and lower his voice two octaves, "and you should have seen Bobby's face, he went white. And get this," Angel gasped for air, "Bobby told Mo that it looked like had David wrote it. We couldn't have planned it better."
"That's great. I thought it would take them a while to put that together," I said mapping out the new timeline in my mind. 
"You sure stirred up a hornets nest. Are you sure about this?" asked Angel. 
"Never more sure," I said as I gather my things. "I'll be on watch at the diner. Out of sight, but on watch. They've gotta return Ma and Bee now." 
"Yeah, maybe." The concern in Angel's voice was clear. "But what if they only return your Ma?" 
"Why would you say that?" 
Angel shrugged. 
"Listen you did a great job, thanks, but I'm not going to think that way."

            <Text>Waves of heat shimmered up from the blacktop in front of the diner. Crouching behind a creosote bush, I kept watch on the diner through the stomata, closed for the rest of the day to preserve its water. The lunch crowd was sparse. Town was quiet. I watched the diner, my focus on seeing Ma and Bee, wondering if they had been hurt, or worse. I swiped my eyes with the back of my hand. Surely, the Cartel took me serious now. They wouldn't risk losing more; they had to return them. My heart beat in my throat. A deep breath kept further tears at bay. 
I shook my head, forced my eye closed. Focus. Distracted by Angel sitting across the street on in front of Jeb's store, I almost missed the flash of light from the roof top across the way. From my side of the street, 45 degrees to my right, two more quick flashes. 
A bevy of Quail fluttered away. My adrenaline pumped, heart raced. It's an ambush––a hand the size of my face covered my mouth. My nostrils filled with a flowery sweet smell. An forearm thrust up against my throat, and my body against what felt like a monster of a man who pulled me backwards, and down into a deep deep darkness... </Text>

            <Text>That night, Pa came in from the fields. He smelled of cow shit mixed with unbathed stench baked into his skin from the hours toiling in the blazing Arizona sun. As soon as he slammed the front door, he saw the setting for Bee at the dinner table. 
I held my breath. 
He glared at me as he smashed the extra plate against the wall.
Ma stood at the stove and stirred the sauce. I slipped between her and him. 
"No way. You really is crazy if you think I’m putting up with this." He raised his hand and flung the back of it across my face. "Now get me my dinner."

Pa shoved meatloaf and mashed potatoes in his mouth, barely chewing, slopping gravy on his shirt. He gulped down his fourth beer. His belch announced he was done.
“I heard you was working with Caroline Jones. We don’t accept charity. Tell her you won’t be coming by anymore,” pa said. 
“It’s not charity. I work for her.” 
“Ha! You’re too stupid to work for anybody. It’s charity. Besides you've got chores enough around here. Now give me whatever money she’s given you so far.” 
I glared at him. “I haven’t been paid yet.” I lied. 
He squinted his eyes at me. “Yeah, well, don’t go back.” 
I opened my mouth to speak but his look kept me from talking. We finished our dinner in silence. 
"One good thing, Bee don’t eat much, and from the looks of it neither do you," pa laughed, pushed back his chair, and stood. As he pass by me he whacked my head. "Looks like you got some sweeping to do." He kicked part of the broken plate at my legs. He grabbed another beer, and plopped into his chair in front of the TV. 
I slid some meatloaf and rolls into my apron pocket for Bee, then took the dishes to the sink where ma was washing. 
"Why do you make trouble, Suzie? You know Bee don’t sit at the table when he’s home," Ma whispered. 
"But it's not right."
"Stop, now, before you get us another beating." She soaked her hands in the soapy water and lowered her eyes. "I can’t take much more."
"It’s okay, ma. We don’t need him. We don’t need nobody." 
Ma shook her head and went back to washing dishes. "You seem to need Bee," Ma said without looking up.

 I spent the rest of the night in my bedroom with the door closed. The meatloaf I snuck in didn't take long to disappear. Ma's words 'you seem to need Bee,' and Mrs. Jones's words, 'It isn't cute anymore,' and 'she's got to accept the truth' echoed in my head. I didn't need Bee, Bee needed me. If it weren't for me, she'd take the beatings from Pa, and wouldn't have a voice. She needed me, and I was nothing without her.

            <Text>
Losing a baby does something to a girl. Some girls get over it, but they're 'off', a-bit. Others never get over it and aren't ever the same. Times that by three, and I'm not talking the holy three––and you've got my sister, Bee Bannon. She birthed three dead babies in four years. Oh, she’s here, but she ain’t. Like they say, lights are on, but nobody’s home. She sits in that rocking chair on the front porch, gazing over the barren, scorched fields, but she inside she’s gone. Little did we realize then, but this third death forewarned of deaths to come. 
The midwife called them still-births, but there wasn't anything “still” about them. This last one, Bee screamed and thrashed around like a hooked fish. The midwife yanked. Blood everywhere. After it was out, she slapped it again, and again. Then stuck her fingers down its tiny throat.
But nothing. 
We all stared at the little bloody mess. But Bee, she caught on having been there two times before, and she hollered louder than a band of coyote after a kill. It took the midwife sticking her with a needle to settle her. 
Bee never did talk a lot, but after the first baby died, she hadn’t said a word since, but to me.
Can’t blame her. Not much worth saying. Some declare she’s crazy. Other folk say she ain’t there. Not just ’cause of the dead babies. Neighbors around here whisper that our mama, Susan, is crazy too, and they claim crazy is passed from kin to kin like hand-me-down clothes. Thus, mama and Bee got the crazies from my Pa, David. But he didn’t quite pass it to them, as he did beat it into Ma, and screw it into Bee. 
New folk, although we don’t get many of those, figure Susan, my Ma must have been off to have named her two girls Suzie-A and Suzie-B. That is until they meet us. Then they give me that knowing smile, and they seem okay with it. 
Folks call me Suzie, and my sister they call her Bee. We have have the same ma and pa, but not much else in common. I’m tall and thin with a big mouth that gets me the belt. Bee’s a pretty thing, folks say. Suppose that’s why pa took to doing her. Ma said, she and me, we are just good for beatings. Lucky, I guess.
A month before the second baby died, my brother, Jacob, joined the Army to fight in the Iraq Invasion and look for weapons of mass destruction. 
Father Joe preached the importance of treating everyone equal. Pa took that to heart. He’d beat equally on Ma, then me, and by the time he got to Jacob, Pa’s rage erupted like hot molten lava over Jacob’s slight frame and soft skin. Not sure which motivated Jacob more: getting away from Pa, or spiting him. So, with only a smidgeon of light left in his soul, Jacob enlisted. He didn’t have to go to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction––they were right here at home. 
Jacob was the lucky one. He got away.</Text>

            <Text>
At the end of the night, Bobby packed up his gear. Halfway to his truck, one of the boss-lackeys called out, "Bobby, let’s talk." He waved for Bobby to come into the motorhome. 
Bobby looked at the rest of the guys already in the back of his truck waiting to go home. He shrugged at them. "Hang on. This shouldn’t take too long." He had never been called to the motorhome before. His confident demeanor covered a multitude of fears. 
When he opened the door, four men crowded the motorhome. There was no chair for him. He stood in front of them. "Close the door," said the foreman. 
His sweaty palm closed the door behind him. "What- up?" Dread rose from Bobby's stomach into his throat. 
"Where’s David?" asked the Foreman. 
The other three men Bobby didn’t recognize. Each sat in their fancy suits and ties with their arms crossed and legs splayed. What idiot wear’s a tie out here? Bobby thought. One wore glasses and should have had a pocket protector. Nerd. The big burley guy could eat the nerd for lunch with his gold tooth, gold jewelry, and dreadlocks. The third man, he exuded money and power. His suit, unlike the other two, was perfectly tailored in a material that shined even in this god-forsaken dust bowl.
"He took the night off," Bobby responded to the foreman, but kept one eye on the burley guy.
All three men looked him up and down.
"You vouched for him." The Gold-man said. 
"Yea sure, but I didn’t guarantee he’d work every night. He’s feeling a bit under the weather, I think. A guy's got a right to have a night off, you know." The men sat silent as Bobby blathered on. "Just needed some rest, that’s all." He took a breath. The silence hit his ears like bullets. Shut up, shut up. 
Bobby broke. "What’s the big deal?" 
"Sick, you say? Just needs rest?" said the foreman. 
"Yea, yeah, that’s all. He’ll be back soon." The words slipped out. Why the hell did I say that? 
"Soon?" The foreman looked to the Money Man who gave him a slight nod. "Okay. You can leave." 
"What?" Bobby scanned the men but didn’t wait for an answer.
Before he could escape the Nerd asked, "By the way, was that you on the old mine road yesterday about noon?
Damn it all. Bobby had passed a car he didn’t recognize on the way out after dropping off Suzie at her truck. He figured they didn’t know him either, so didn’t give it much thought––there were trucks up and down this road all day; why would they think it was him? Bobby move into Suzies house
"Yesterday? Noon? No, no, can’t say it was me. You know, I can’t imagine what I’d be doing out there during the day at all. There’s lots of trucks 'round these parts––" 
The burley man stood. "The man said, leave."

When Bobby left that night for the mine, he wasn't happy, but had yet to figure a way around my threat. After he was gone, I set my plan in motion. 
I cut out letters from an old magazine and glued them to a piece of paper. In the end, the note looked like the ones you see on TV from serial killers sent to the FBI. This note, however, was for the Cartel. Bully the bully. It had worked for me with the land owners when they tried to cheat the pickers. It had worked on Bobby but it hadn't worked to well with Pa, but sure felt good. One thing I was sure of––the Cartel had no intention of letting Bee live, if she were alive at all. But I would know if Bee was dead, I'd feel it; she was alive, I just knew it.
It sure would be nice to have Aiden verify what Bobby had told me. I wanted to ask Aiden to help, but I wasn't sure whose side he was really on. My gut told me he was on my side, but I couldn't trust my gut, I couldn't trust anyone. I had to do this alone. 

I parked the truck about three blocks down and around the corner from The Corner Store and waited until Gold-man arrived. After he went into the store, I walked up to his truck and slipped the note through his window, onto the driver's seat. Now, it was just a matter of time.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie steals Cartel Money from dry cleaners.</Title>
            <Synopsis>Cartel does not act on Suzie's threat; they think it is a joke. She ups the game to show them she isn't kidding. She steals from one of their money laundering businesses which just got a large money drop that morning. ***remove part where she takes the papers. Add to somewhere else - maybe takes them from Aiden's garage? He hasn't turned them over yet?? Or steals them from the motor home when she is captured? 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Time was up. The Cartel had not responded to my note. I hadn't really thought they would, but now they'd see that I wasn't playing around.
I drove into town but parked two blocks in from the main drag. Strolling down the street, I kept an eye on the dry cleaners. I stopped in the drug store across from it. I remembered the dry cleaner's layout from the days I had worked there. It hadn't changed much, at least on the outside, since the Cartel took it over. As I was flipping through the latest People Magazine, Gold-man pulled and strutted into the cleaners, just as Aiden said he would. He walked in with a stuffed duffel bag, but left fifteen minutes later with an empty one. 
Wanting to confirm that nothing had changed on the inside, I grabbed an old jacket from the truck. Pleased I didn't recognize the person at the counter, I plopped the jacket on the counter, noting the addition of camera's in the front lobby. 
"Big brother is always watching, isn't he?" I asked the clerk, a teenager with enough tattoos on her arm to make it look like she wore a long sleeve shirt.
The clerk looked to the cameras. "Shit yea. Those things." She shook her head in apparent disgust.
"Do you get any privacy, anywhere?" I said trying to sound sympathetic. 
"Back office, until next week. They are going to do a major remodel and more cameras will go in back there." She put air quotes around "remodel" as she said it. "Really sucks." 
"Yea, I bet. Sorry. No privacy anywhere, any more."
The clerk handed me the pick-up ticket, nodding her head in agreement. The clerk was in no hurry to get back to work. 
I glanced at the ticket made out to Jocelyn James - the first name that popped in to my head. "Well, good luck with that. Thanks," I said. 

After midnight, I rounded the corner, making a beeline to the alley. A few feet away from the dry cleaner's back door, I pushed up on the window frame, but it was locked, which for this neighborhood was unusual, but I guess the Cartel brought their big city worries with them. I grabbed a rag from a nearby bin, and wrapped my elbow in it before smashing the window. I stood still after the crash, listening into the night. When nothing stirred, I scrapped the remaining glass from its frame with a stick, and placed the rag over the sill, and put on my gloves. 
A bucket, flipped upside-down, raised me enough to get through the window. I landed inside, on a table underneath the window. Kitty-corner to the window, I was surprised to see was a bookshelf. When I worked here, the door of a safe was flush to the wall. I'd deposit the daily receipts before I left work each night. I jumped off the table, inspecting the bookshelf. It looked heavy. I anchored my heels against the wall, squatted down a bit, and shoved the side of the bookcase.
The bookcase slid like it was on ice, until it jammed into the opposite coroner. Books, papers and office supplies scattered on the shelves, some flying onto the floor. Gravity sucked me to the ground. My right knee and palm broke my fall before I landed on my right hip and rolled to my side. Laying on the ground, I could see small casters on the bottom of the bookshelf, hidden by the fake front molding. Well, that explains that. I was lucky it hadn't toppled over. 
Allowing my body a minute to recover, I listened for any sign someone might have heard my commotion. Once I was sure I hadn't obliterated my knee cap, I brushed myself off. Using the flash light from my cellphone, I worked on the safe. Right three turns to 23, left past 16, then stop at 16, right to 6. [//Todo/should the combination mean something] 
Click. They hadn't changed the combination. I was in luck. 
Inside were stacks of money wrapped in paper bundles, and a few files. I tossed stacks of money into my duffle bag.
I closed the safe, and using a much lighter touch moved the bookcase back. I cleaned up as much as possible to get the room looking like it did when I arrive. The broken window was a dead giveaway, but everything in its place might gain some time. 
 With the items on the bookcase straighten, stuff on the floor back on the shelves, and the window glass cleaned up and carefully wrapped in paper towels and put into my duffel. Inspecting my work, I took a deep breath. 

Back in the alley, I noticed some of the glass on the street and cleaned it up and tossed it and the glass in my duffle into a near by trash bin. With my pocket knife, I cut a piece of cardboard the size of the window, and used duck tape that I had taken from the office to cover the broken window. No longer needing the bucket, I moved it back near the dumpster. I glanced around noting that it looked just like when I had arrived. With my duffle filled with cash, I meandered through back alleys for before reaching my truck.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Ma found dead</Title>
            <Synopsis>She gets a bout of guilt and decides to try and find her Pa to warn him. She deduces the only place he could use as a hide-out is the old shack. She goes there, finds evidence Pa is holding up there, but also finds Ma dead. Pa has killed her. </Synopsis>
            <Text>I stood on my front porch staring at the front door. From here I could hope that somehow Ma and Bee would be inside. I reached for the knob, and pressed my ear against the door. Stepping through, hope died. 
Who else would die before this was over. I considered what the Cartel might do to Bobby, now that they knew Pa was alive. Bobby was an idiot and a jerk but he didn't deserve to die. There had been enough death in this town. Bobby's only chance was if Pa returned the goods to the Cartel, and told them Bobby wasn't involved. Might even save Pa. 
Convincing Pa would be difficult, but if he knew that the Cartel had Ma and Bee, and that Bobby was at risk, maybe, just maybe, if any spec of the man from Ma's diary was till in there, he would do the right thing. 
But I had to find him first. Pa options were limited. All his buddies worked in the mine, so he wasn't staying with any of them. But there was one place he might hold up. 
I headed out on foot to the old shack where Aiden's Pa had caught Aiden and I together. Pa sometimes used it when hunting. I hadn't been out there since that day Aiden betrayed me, the day he choose Bee. 
The shack came into sight. I waited and watched. I finished my bottle of water. By dust and no signs of life my patience was wearing thin. But I waited. 
About another hour, with still no movement, I slunk to the shack. A odd oder waved passed me like when a woman struts in front of you with too much bad perfume on. From the side window signs of Pa confirmed he had been there: bloody bandages, Pa's shirt, and empty beer cans littered the floor. He should be dead with all that blood on his shirt; he was a tough ol' bastard. 
Although certain no one was there, I entered through the back door like a cat. The oder grew stronger. 
In the front room, I picked up the bloody shirt. The image of Pa pinned against the back of the building at the mine flashed before me. He had on a different shirt. My focus shifted to the beer cans, then to the half eaten can of beans from the table, and the unopened cans of tuna and soup on the counter. And another ray of hope of hope faded. 
I knew someone had been in the house. He must have come back, got some clothes, beer and food. I had hoped it had been Ma. 
Outside, footsteps approached. My eyes darted searching for a place to hide. I thought I could make it out the back door, but then heard a noise in that direction as well. Making my way to the window, I stumbled on the hook to the hatch that led to the crawl space underneath the house. I opened it wide enough to slip under the floor and close it over my head. 
The footfall continued. Crouching beneath the house, I was as still as dried cement, except for my heart fluttering like hummingbird's wings. Was it more than one person? I closed my eyes and held my breath. 
The clucking trill of a Javelina pack rumbled in. The steady, calm, mucking sound proved there was no one in their line of sight, or their sounds would have been much more threatening. I let out a sigh of relieve. It must have been their stench I smelled. Relieved, I looked around the crawl space to get my bearings. 
A rolled up carpet, toward the edge of the house, caught my eye. It was the old rotted-out carpet that used to be on the floor of the shack. I hadn't noticed it was missing. I crawled over to it. Putrid rot filled my nose. 
"Oh my god!" I shuffled away from the carpet. 
A foot poked out of the carpet roll. The stench undeniable now: the acrid stench of death. 
I couldn't breath; my hand trembled, my stomach roiled. A foot. A human foot. When my breath returned, I inched back to the carpet. It took only two rolls of the carpet to expose the body inside.
It was Ma. 
"No! No, no, no, no." The words scratched my throat as they escaped. Tears streamed down my face and pressure built in my chest. 
Ma's eyes looked back at me, pleading. My stomach spasmed; I vomited. Again. And again. 
Minutes later, I alternated deep breaths with spitting out the sour taste. I turned back to Ma's body. 
Her face had beaten into a horrid, terrified look. The back of her head, bashed in. Her torn clothes, bloody. I reached over to close her eyes; her skin was cold, dull. This was Ma's body, but she was no longer there.
A tragic shriek of despair exploded around me, shaking the floor boards above. Violent sobs convulsed through me. A dark cloud of sorrow enveloped me as I fell over on my side into the fetal position. Allowing my sobs to rock me, I wanted to join her in death. </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) After the funeral</Title>
            <Synopsis>Mass funeral - S arranged for a big banquet for the town using the money she stole.  It rains </Synopsis>
            <Text>The whole town turned out for the funeral. The humidity was high, and the heat soaked our clothes, but it didn't matter. These lives mattered. Aiden stood next to me and held my hand. His acceptance disoriented me. How could he still love me after what those men did to me? After what my Pa did to me. But he did. None of it mattered to him. “As long as it takes,” he said. He'd be there when I was ready. 
Mrs. Jones stood on my other side. She eyed our hands and smiled. 
After the grave-side ceremony, we all marched back to the field next to the church. Although a solemn occasion, we choose to celebrate their lives and the rebirth of our town without the Cartel. 
Murmurs grew louder as we approached the field. 
"Oh, my god?" "Where did all this come from?" "What's going on?" 
Tables and tables of catered food: meats, vegetables, salads, deserts outlined the field. A carving station of roast beef in the center, with a server standing ready to carve. 
The townsfolk rushed in and filled their plates. Maybe the first full meal some of them had in a while. Sure was for me. 
Dot strolled in late, pulling behind her a child's red-wagon carrying jugs full of her infamous Aloe Vera juice. 
"What have I missed?" she said over the boisterous crowd. In minutes everyone partook of her miracle juice. Good for anything that ails you and more.
Mrs. Jones and I stood, taking in the bounty. 
"You have anything to do with this?" Mrs. Jones said. 
"Manna from heaven, I guess," I said. 
"What ever happened with that $750K from the dry cleaners?"
"Donated, I heard." 
As if God himself were participating in the celebration, the sky opened and rain poured out. Everyone lifted their hands and faces to the sky and drunk in the life giving water. The farmers danced and laughed until the rain softened the ground and their shoes were covered in mud. 
The rain soaked through to my bones. Bee’s warmth blossomed within me, and the fracture inside me began to seal.

            <Synopsis>As S and Aiden leave the hospital - see Bobby's body hanging in town square 
S feels even more pressure to save herself and the town. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Driving away from the hospital, a woman's scream reverberated down Main street. Patrons from the bakery, The Corner Store, and the bank flooded the street to see what was going on, blocking our car. We got out and followed the scream to a woman pointing to the World War Two statue honoring the Arizona men who had died in the war. A body hung from the neck of the statue like a medallion won in war. Blood still dripped from where his hands and feet once where.
I screamed, but nothing came out. 
It was Bobby. 
The acid sting of fear ate through my veins. 
Pinned to his chest was the note I had penned in David's writing threatening the Cartel, only now across the note the words––YOU'RE NEXT––screamed out. 
Aiden raised my hoodie and spun me around and dragged me away from the scene, dodging gawkers blocking the road. Glancing back at Bobby’s mutilated body, the message was clear. 
"So that's what he meant,” I said. 
Bobby's contorted face emblazoned on the inside of my eyelids. 
Aiden started the car. "Who?" 
"Pa. He told me not to play games. That Bobby had tried that. And now he's dead." 
"But why?" asked Aiden, turning at the road to his house. 
"Bobby said he’d tell them Pa was alive." 
"So they gave him an ultimatum," Aiden said. 
"Just like the one they gave me––The money or die."
"How stupid can I be? Running around chasing Bee. Threatening the Cartel, stirring them up and for nothing. It was Pa all along." 
"Your Pa wrote the note? Not the Cartel?" 
"Because of me Ma’s dead, Bobby’s dead, and the Cartel is after me. What have I done? They can’t have died in vain. We have to save this town, our town from the Cartel's scourge.”

</Synopsis>
            <Text>Maybe Ma was born slow, or maybe the beatings helped it along, but some time after the third baby died she figured it out, probably more like finally admitted, that Pa had been doing Bee. 
She asked him, "You the daddy?"
 "No," he said with dripping sarcasm. "Maculate ’ceptions I suppose," he laughed, shaking his head. 
Ma walked up to him. Face to face. Slapped him. I couldn’t believe it, I had never seen her stand up to him before. But he didn’t take kindly to it. He full-on punched her in the face. 
She staggered back, blood poured from her nose.
Pa stomped out the front door, pushing the porch screen so hard it stuck open. An odd silence filled the room. Time seemed to stand still, and race all at once. 
Pa's the daddy. 
When it sunk in, she wasn’t slow at all.
Ma reached behind the door. 
Bang. The shotgun blasted. 
Then stillness.
Pa’s body was on the ground, face down.
My feet seemed bolted to the ground. I swapped glances between Ma’s bloody nose and Pa’s bleeding body. I felt Bee smile.
Without a word, Ma reloaded the shotgun and put it back behind the door where it’s kept. She took off her apron and wiped her bloody nose. 
"Don’t you worry. Everything is going to be alright," Ma said. 
She went into the kitchen and picked up the phone. "Bobby, I need you here, can you come right away?… No?" She scurried about, tossing her apron in the wash after one last swipe to her nose. "It’s important. Can you come soon?… One hour?… No sooner?… It’s really important, come as soon as you can." She hung up the phone. 
Ma took a deep breath and smoothed her dress. "Well, now. You hungry?" Ma said. "I’ll make breakfast."
I couldn’t believe my ears. "Shouldn’t we call 911 or something?
"No need for 911. I’ll call the police after Bobby gets here." Ma put her arm around me. "Now Suzie, what happened here, we cannot talk about it to anyone." Ma’s voice was stern. "Anyone. Ever." 
I’d never heard her stern before. Her eyes probed me. A second later, a wave of recognition crashed in me. I didn't want Ma to be taken away. 
I looked out at Pa, lying there. Did he move? 
True to her word, we had breakfast. The holiday kind of breakfast we have when other kin are around. Eggs, bacon, pancakes with homemade maple syrup. 
Pa laid in the front yard. Shot. Long ago I had mourned the loss of my Pa, the Pa that didn’t beat us as much, or make babies with Bee. That Pa, he died eons ago. Yet, this rush of sadness flooded me.
"Everything’s alright now," she said. "No one’s ever going to hurt us, ever again." Ma began to clear the plates. Her head held higher, back straighter, eyes brighter. 
"What we going to do today?" asked Ma. 
My eyes darted between the front yard and this strange woman filled with confidence and unrelenting action. 
"Don’t you worry about the mess, pumpkin," she said. 
The dishes, or Pa? Should we go see about Pa? Bee’s mouth looked like a fly trap, awaiting its prey. 
I sat back down. 
"So?" Ma smiled. "I know. Let’s picnic! We can fetch the fattest chicken, fry ‘em crispy, and make some potato salad. We’ll pack it all up and go down by the lake. How does that sound?" 
I tried to talk but nothing came out on the count of I was still thinking of Pa in the front yard.
Bee sat up a little straighter. 
"Why, that’s the spirit! Now Suzie, doesn’t your Bee deserve a fun day. What ya say? You good?" 
Maybe they were right––maybe we's all crazy. 
"Uh. Sure," I mumbled. 
"Wonderful! Now how about you finish up here and start getting that chicken ready for our picnic. As soon as Uncle Bobby gets here, I’m goin’ out a piece, but I be back, and we’ll head out." 
"You’re leaving?" 
She started to raise her hands. I stiffened. 
Tears filled her eyes. 
"Oh, sweetie. I’m just reaching to hug you. You don’t ever have to be scared again." 
She cupped my face with her hands, pulled me in and kissed my cheek. The shooting did something to her. Ma was different. 

Bobby pulled up in his Chevy truck, stopping feet from where Pa lay. He rushed out of the car to David’s side. 
"What the hell? Who did this?" Bobby kneeled next to David. His hand started to touch him, then he pulled it back just as quick.
"Thank god you’re here," Susan said to her brother. 
"Christ, Susan." Bobby jumped to his feet and stood face to face with her. Part of him wanted to hit her, the part that knew David was the closest thing he had to a friend. Another part of him was glad he was dead: David never deserved this land, his land. David wasn’t even a farmer. The sweat beaded on his forehead, his jaw clench. 
Susan fixed her stare. "You. Owe. Me." 
The words didn’t register at first. Then it hit him. It was so long ago he had figured she’d never call in her chip. Damnit. Damnit. Damnit. Memories of the street whore’s battered face and lifeless body flashed before his eyes.
His face went slack. This would be the second dead body they’d moved. 
"Okay, then." Susan took a breath. "I’ll get the truck." 
Bobby stood there. Stunned.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>My thoughts swirled downward, collided with sounds, divided and rolled in the smells; light turned dark and split with flashes of knowing, and then not knowing. Seeing Bee's battered body in the mirror, feeling her warmth, smelling her fear, loving her being––was replaced by sadness and loss. Swirling, swirling, I sank into a deep black pit, filled with nothing but offered death. 	An alarm bell blared, poking a hole in the darkness. I woke to see medical angels of mercy hovered over a person in a bed next to mine. They pumped and poked, injected and zapped the body being held together by hospital sheets and plastic tubes. It arched and flopped down. 
Then silence. 
I knew that silence. The silence of a stillbirth, the silence of death. Chaos reigned as doctors shouted and nurses scurried about. 
Another shock.
And nothing. 
The silence of death, was that Bee? I slipped back into my mind morphing memories where my face replaced Bee's. Where her soft sweetness melded into my hard tenacity. Her beauty enhanced my ruggedness. Her pain completed mine. Completed me.
A door closing brought me back to consciousness. Through my drug induced state, a silhouette of a man approached me. His familiarity seeped in like sewage. 
I struggled to get out of the bed, but was caught by the IV line. As he placed his hand over my mouth, flashes of him on top of me flooded in. 
Pa. 
"Listen here, bitch. I want my money and drugs back. Now where are they?" 
Bee flashed before my eye the moment his voice hit my ears. Disdain dripped off his words. Bee left when Pa was gone—it hit me like one of Pa's punches. She protected me, I wasn't protecting her. I risked my life to save her, but all along I had to save myself. The fissure in my brain, ceased widening. Acceptance, the glue that could mend me. 
Muffled squealing sounds escaped through pressure of his hand, but no one heard. 
"Tell me or we'll both end up like Bobby. Now where are they?" He released his hand for me to speak while holding a knife at my neck. 
"What money?" I choked out. 
He pressed the knife closer in and replaced his hand over my mouth. 
"Don't play games with me. I know you dug up the graves. You ignored my warning, and how your Ma is dead. Now, where is it?" 
"Your warning?" He left the note? 
A metal tray crashed on the hard linoleum floor outside my door. Pa spun his face to the doorway. All the while the sharp steel pinched my skin. Nurses came to help clean up the mishap behind the partially closed door to my room. Pa leaned down. The moisture of his harsh breath caressed my ear. 
"The money, or you." He slid the knife into his sleeve. 
I seized the opportunity. "Nurse! Nurse!" 
The door flew open. Pa lowered his face and rushed passed a nurse. 
"What the..." The nurse said, struggling to maintain her balance. "Are you alright?" 
"I am now. Thank you." 
She glanced back to the door, then turned back to me. She reviewed the IV line and checked the monitors. 
Aiden ran into the room. "Suzie. Thank god you're alright. Was that...?" Aiden leaned his head toward the door. 
I nodded yes. 
"You gave us quiet the scare, young lady. If it hadn't been for this young man..." Her voice trailed off as she smiled at me, and then at Aiden. "The doctor's on his way, but I'd say you're looking much better." 
"How'd I get here?" I asked. 
"I brought you in," said Aiden. 
"How?" 
"I tracked my ATV using its low-jack. I searched the area and found your backpack. You hid in the brush about 20 yards away." Aiden gently brushed my hair away from my eyes. 
The images of Pa on top of me, superimposed by the CC13 men congealed in my mind. My bloodied face, my ripped shirt, my bare legs. Aiden saw me like that. The need for Bee overwhelmed me. The taste of metal permeated my mouth. The smell of Pa sickened me. How could I have let that happen? I turned my head away from Aiden. 
"Now you just wait a minute here." The nurse's warm eyes saw me. "You have nothing to be ashamed of," said the nurse, caressing my cheek with the back of her hand. "Nothing, you hear me." 
Shame? Was this shame? I saw Bee standing in front of the mirror, with her thighs blotched with bruises. But the reflection was me. The look of sadness, resignation, acceptance. Was that shame? I had always thought she didn't talk to others out of shame, but it was my own shame that had created her.
A man in a white coat came in the room. His blond hair framed his green eyes, his smile matched the warmth of the nurses. 
"I'm Doctor Gregory. Let me take a look at you." He directed a small flash light in and out of each eye, had me follow his finger, and gently touched my ribs. 
"Physically, you're doing fine. It's going to take a bit before the pain goes away, especially in those ribs, and you'll have quite the shiner for a while, but all in all, I'd say you're pretty lucky." His eyes closed as soon as the word lucky left his lips. He shook his head. 
"What he means," said the nurse, "is that you should be released soon. In the mean time, the police need to talk to you." 
Two women walked into the room. Aiden squeezed my hand a bit harder. When I looked at him he was staring at the woman with an almost shaved head, and a scare on her cheek.  
"Suzie, I'm Detective Claire Navarro, but please call me Claire." Claire stood close to the bed, her eyes stayed glued to me. Not intense, but caring. "And this is Detective Justine Ruiz." The second woman nodded her head and maintained her distance behind Claire. Her coldness iced the room. 
Justine Ruiz. She'd been at the motorhome. That neo-natzi look, notable. I looked to Aiden; his eyes told me he knew. 
“Can you tell us who did this to you?” continued Claire. 
"I don't remember." 
"That's okay. Tell us what you do remember?" 
Both detectives watched me, waited for my answer. I eyed them. Were they here to help? Or did the Cartel send them to ensure I wouldn't talk?
"Nothing." I shook my head. "The last thing I remember was wanting to go on an ATV ride, just for fun. The next thing I remember, I woke up here."
"Who was that man?" inquired the nurse. 
Justine glared at me. "What man?" 
"Nobody, just a friend." Was she looking for Pa? "He was in a hurry to get to work, sorry he rushed out like he did." 
The nurse squinted at me, and shook her head. Claire motioned for Justine to follow the nurse out. 
"Do you ride Mr. Manwell's ATV often?" ask Claire. 
"Aiden's ATV? Yeah, sure, I ride it all the time." I nodded at Aiden with raised eyebrows. He nodded back to Claire.
"So you do remember riding the ATV but nothing else?"
"No, nothing." I slid down into the bed and yawned. 
"Okay. It's not unusual. The doctor said you might not remember. He also said that your memory may return in bits and pieces. As that happens, please call me." Clair handed me a business card. "My personal cell is on the back. Use it anytime. I'll let you rest for now." She smiled, nodded at Aiden and left the room.
"What's going on?" Aiden asked when they were out of earshot. 
"Not now. Just get me out of here." </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Jeb finishes story about Suzie's Ma </Title>
            <Synopsis>Jeb goes home from hospital and tells S about her mom
Jeb apologies and gives his blessing for her and Aiden</Synopsis>
            <Text>I wasn't sure things would ever be right with me and Aiden. Pa never made me feel dirty––used––but not dirty. Both those Cartel men taking turns, laughing and joking––that made me feel dirty. I couldn't stop seeing them, feeling them. Out of nowhere, my nostrils clogged with their stench, my skin shriveled from grit, and my mouth rusted with the taste of blood.
I returned to the hospital the next day to pick up Jeb, and take him to the funeral, then home. We talked the whole way. Had he changed or did I? 	"I owe you an apology," Jeb said.
I took my eyes off the road to look at him. 
"I haven't treated you good," he said. 
Was I to agree?
"Aiden tells me you're the one responsible for getting me out from under the Cartel's thumb." 
I fixed on the road in front of me.
Silence grew. 
"Your ma got pregnant after that night," his breathing deep, "with you." 
I sensed him starring at me. 
"No, you couldn't have been mine, before you ask, but oh how I wanted you to be. Instead, you became a constant reminder of how I lost your ma. Don't get me wrong, I loved my wife, and am grateful for Aiden and Jo. I hope I treated her well, but even she saw I still loved your ma."
Silent questions filled the space between us.
I drew in a breath. "But why? Why would she marry him?"
"You never met her Pa, did you?" 
I shook my head. 
"Your Pa was a mouse compared to your Grand-Pa. Meanest son-of-a-bitch I ever met." 
The entries in my ma's diary, her savings, made even more sense now.
"Your pa and your ma's pa frequented the same drinking hole. One night, drunk as a tick in a bloodbath, he bragged about what he did and when Susan turned up pregnant six weeks later, he put two and two together and went after your pa. You Gramps was no match for your Pa. Your ma and him married the next day. And in return, your pa got the farm." 
"So, you're the one ma wrote about?" I said, seeing the words of the pages of her diary appear before my eyes. 
His eyes squinted. 
"She kept a diary. She wrote about a man who treated her with kindness, with warmth. I thought she was talking about Pa when they first met. O guess I wanted to believe pa had been good once. But it was you." 
Tears filled his eyes. He leaned in and rubbed my shoulder. 
"And you deserve to be treated like that too. I've resented you from the day you were conceived. I was no match for your Pa in strength or grit. So, I took my sorrow out on you."
My breathing grew ragged, tears welled. 
"Aiden loves you, you know? Not Bee. You." 
The sound of his name provoked visions of a revolving door of men taking their turn at me. Tears flowed as memories flooded in about pa and everything he did to Bee. To me.
"But he doesn't know everything," I said scrunching closed the top of my shirt. The pain in my ribs throbbed.
"Maybe not. But there's nothing that boy can't handle when it comes to you." 
"There is no Bee." 
Jeb smiled that same knowing smile I had seen so many times. "Glad to hear it. Now maybe you can heal and learn to love as much as I loved your ma."
"Now, let's get to the store before my kids give everything away," Jeb said, lightening the mood. 
Jeb broke into a contagious laugher. The first time I laughed in months. The first time Bee laughed, ever.  </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Aiden delivers money to Cartel</Title>
            <Synopsis>Aiden delivers money to the Cartel, also misinforms them that the FBI is focusing on the movie theatre and doesn't tell them he knows about the other stores. He believes he is protecting Suzie's Ma. He then meets with his FBI handler but doesn't tell him what he and Mrs. Jones figured out about the other store involved in the money laundering. </Synopsis>
            <Text>As Aiden zipped up the bag, he glanced around the garage. The yarn that hung on the wall harkened a happier time. A time when his Ma smiled and sang, when his Pa felt proud to own the Corner store, when Bee didn't exist, and Suzie was his. 
He froze. 
"What? What do you hear," Mrs. Jones whispered. 
"Shh." 
Like statues, they listened beyond the walls. Aiden moved to the window. He peered out just in time to see a young woman slip into the alley. "I think it was Suzie," said Aiden. 
"Are you sure?" Mrs. Jones said stepping behind him. 
"Yea, pretty sure." 
"What was she doing here?" 
"The better question is, what did she hear?" said Aiden. 
They looked around at the papers before them, and the bag of money that had been open and visible. 
"We've got to assume she saw all this, and heard something," Mrs. Jones said. "Maybe you should tell your handler." 
"Yea, maybe." 
"No maybe about it. We don't know who all is involved yet. Street cops, business owners, Priests, for christ's sake, city council members, heck maybe even the Mayor might be involved. If she says something to the wrong person...I don't want to even think about." 
"Yeah. I know," Aiden reached for the canvas bag with the brief case in the other hand. "I've got to go. Would you put all this away? Lock up when you leave, OK? Can't have anyone else stumbling on it." 
"Sure, I'll take care of it." Mrs. Jone tucked in her chin and raised her eyebrows. "And you talk to your boss." 

Aiden pulled in to the store parking lot at the same time as Mo drove-up in his fancy, gold, tricked-out truck. 
"Hey," grunted Mo. 
Aiden nodded.
"Where have you been? You left camp almost two hours ago, and you're just now arriving?" said Mo.
"You do realized we are right in the middle of town. Me driving up that early would raise suspicions. What am I gonna tell Jerry when he steps out of his bakery to see if anything is wrong, cause something must be wrong for me to arrive that early." 
"You tell him it's none of his damn business," said Mo, his gold tooth sparkling in the morning sun. 
"Boy, Mo, you really know how to win friends," Aiden collected the canvas bag and brief case. He kicked his door shut. 
Mo grabbed the bag away from Aiden. "It better all be here." 
"Right, like I'm going to steal from you, then bring you the very bag I stole from. Genius." Aiden shook his head and followed Mo through the store and into the back room where a man in a suit, this time and expensive one, stood over Aiden's Pa looking at paperwork on the desk. 
"I expected to see you here before I arrived," Mo's boss, Guga Guerrero who was better know as el Brutal Abogado or the Brutal Lawyer. Most just called him El Brutal, a moniker Guga was proud of. 
 "When are you going to learn that button down shirts and ties don't work in this heat, besides looking stupid," said Aiden. 
El Brutal's shoved a chair to the ground. "When are you going to learn respect," spit El Brutal. 
Aiden's Pa tried to get between El Brutal and Aiden, but Aiden held his arm out to stop him without losing eye contact with Guga. 
"Go ahead, hit me," Aiden taunted. 
"Aiden, don't," Jeb said under his breath. 
"You should listen to your Pa," said Guga. 
"You. Need. Us," Aiden said holding his stance. "We have to work for you, I get it. But we don't have to like you." 
In a flash, Brutal punched Aiden in the stomach. Aiden doubled over.
"Im not here to be your friend, but you will respect me," said El Brutal. 
Jeb guided Aiden to a chair. "Yea, whatever," Aiden coughed out. 
"It's all here," Mo said nodding to El Brutal. 
"Good." 
"Now, let's get down to business. What news do you have for me from our friends in the FBI?" El Brutal asked Aiden. 
Aiden wanted to spit in his face, but his Pa's hand touching his forearm stopped him. "They are still trying to track the money, but have not had any success. They're focused on the Movie Theatre. The FBI thinks that might be your money laundering operation. They have no inkling of this store, or the tunnel," Aiden spewed the words like venom. 
"Ha, so our ruse worked. They can look at the Movie Theatre all they want, it's legit." El Brutal slapped the table in celebration.

Later that afternoon, Aiden drove fifty miles outside of town to Sierra Vista to the University of Arizona, Sierra Vista branch where he had graduated. He didn't go an an alumni, but to meet his boss.
The back wall, in the basement of the campus library, was lined with small 5x5 offices for students to concentrate on their thesis research. Aiden entered cubical in the far back corner. Special Agent Mark Delacroix was already there.
"I think he bought it," said Aiden skipping the pleasantries. 
"Tell me more," said Agent Delacroix. 
Aiden told the agent about the morning visits to the motor home, and his subsequent interaction with Guga Guerrero in the store, but failed to mention his intermediate stop at the garage and conversation with Mrs. Jones. 
"So he's convinced we are serious about the movie theatre?" 
"Appears so," Aiden said. 
"You seem distracted, what's up," said the agent. 
 Helping his Pa get out from under the thumb of the Cartel's money laundering operation was what got him in bed with the FBI. They had agreed to give his Pa immunity if Aiden infiltrated the Cartel's Jackson operation and fed misinformation to them, and told the FBI anything he had heard or saw that might help their, now five year, investigation. He didn't want to do anything to hinder that agreement but also didn't want to do anything that might hurt Suzie's Ma. 
"Nothing. Just a lot going on." Aiden had no proof the Cartel had Suzie's Ma. "I delivered $750k to Guerrero at the store. I think it was a test though," said Aiden.
"How so?" 
"Well, El Brutal himself handed me the money in the motor home at the mine after Mo had counted it. I was told to take it to the store. But when I got there I handed it back to Mo, who counted it again and confirmed it was all there." Aiden looked up and to the left,"I think they were testing me." 
"Good. They're putting you through the paces," said the Agent nodding. 
"I also delivered a brief case full fake receipts, invoices, and register tapes." 
"Excellent. Were you able to take pictures?" 
"Right here." Aiden handed Delacroix an SD card. 
"Okay," the Agent cocked is head to the left,"anything else?" The agents stare caused Aiden to shift in his seat. Aiden shook his head. 
"Alright then. Let's meet again in a week. In the mean time, you know the signal spot if you need to get us any info, or if you need anything. When I see the mark, we will meet at 7:00 pm or 10:00 am whichever is sooner." 
"Yea sure, the bench in Courthouse park, under the olive tree."
"Good," Agent Delacroix glancing around, "talk to only me, okay?"
"What do you mean? Who else would I talk to?" Aiden asked. 
"I just want to be even more careful. I think we have a mole in the FBI." 


Aiden couldn't shake the feeling that Suzie was up to something. The whole way home, he thought about her outside the back door when Mo was there to share the new of the increased demands, and then again at his garage. He replayed the scene at her house, when she told him she believed the Cartel had her Ma and Bee, and that she was going after them. As he approached the store, a calming breeze settled him: he had decided.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt; ) FBI cleans up </Title>
            <Synopsis>Suzie out of hospital from GSW
FBI strike deal with MrsJ, Aiden and Susie if they come clean. 
FBI guy sums it all up </Synopsis>
            <Text>The hospital released me the next day with my arm in a sling. The bullet had grazed my arm. Mrs. Jones and I walked to Aiden and Jeb’s hospital room, where Agent Delacroix had arranged to meet us.  
We agreed to come clean with everything, but only after the FBI agreed, in writing, to not press changes against us, or the business owners forced to take part in the Cartels money laundering.
"Not so fast. There are conditions," responded Delacroix. 
Mrs. Jones raised her eyebrows. Aiden and I swapped glances. 
"First, the owners must hand over all Cartel related property. Second, they must cooperate, whatever that takes, identifications, names, dates, etc. Third, you two," he said looking at Mrs. Jones and Aiden, "must review the books, the real ones and the cooked books with the FBI forensic accountant and do everything possible to help us identify any remaining money stashes, bank accounts, or laundered investments. And finally," he turned to me, "I can't guarantee you'll get off scot-free. Obstructing an investigation, withholding evidence, breaking and entering, not to mention killing a man. There will be a hearing." 
I lowered my head and examined my hands, "It was worth it." 
The Federal prosecutor smiled at Delacroix, but tried to cover it by clearing his throat and morphing it into more serious, professional face when he saw me watching him. 
"However,” said the Federal Prosecutor, “given your actions helped take down one of the largest drug operations in the US and Mexico, and provided us with enough into for months of busts to come," he stopped, turned to Delacroix who have him a nod, "we'll be putting in a word with the Federal court, and recommending no charges be brought. The hearing is just a formality." 
“Not to mention saving my life,” Delacroix said. “Thank you, Suzie.” 
I breathed again. Mrs. Jones and Aiden hugged me. 
"Thank you," I said. 
"There's something I don't understand,” said Mrs. Jones. “How did you know to bring in Suzie to identify your mole?"  
"She brought herself, but actually, you told me," said Delacroix. 
"Me?" said Mrs. Jones. 
"Yes, when you delivered the documents. You made me promise and I quote, 'Jeb, his family, any store owners threatened into participating in the Cartel's money laundering operation and Suzie wouldn’t face any charges.' I had no idea who Suzie was, or how she was involved before then. Call me slow, but I didn't even know she and you were a thing," said Delacroix, looking at Aiden. 
"Well, we weren't, really. Not then anyway," Aiden blushed. 
"So I couldn't figure why you would need immunity," Delacroix said to me. "Then I put two and two together. You two," he looked at Aiden and Mrs. Jones, "went from providing me almost daily info, to nothing overnight. The shooting in Jeb's store, the dead man being Susie's Pa, a man, who by the way, according to Bob Palmer, was stealing from the Cartel and hadn't shown up for work in days, was dead. Bobby's body in the town center. It all came together when Suzie showed up at the shack to claim her mother's body." Delacroix lowered his voice, "My condolences." He waited a beat. "Turns out, Suzie here, was the common denominator to everything." 
"What I don't get is why you send Agent Palmer to Aiden to confirm the information, if you already suspected he was the mole?" 
"I didn't send him. Information is power. He probably wanted to know what info was valid and not. I suspect he was planning on holding something back as insurance. I thought he’d use Aiden to confirm. Its' what I would have done in his shoes. After all, he knew Aiden was working for us. What he didn't know was that I had already briefed Aiden that the info given to Agent Palmer, was fake, and asked him to confirm it anyway, if Palmer asked. Palmer had to think it was legitimate." 

Later that afternoon, I formally identified Pa's body. It lay on a metal table with a sheet over it. They pulled back the sheet and showed me his head. I motioned for them to pull the sheet back more, displaying his shoulders and chest. His tattoo of a cloaked skull holding a sickle dripping with blood dominated his left shoulder, and on his chest tattoos of multicolored snakes devouring his organs: his heart, his lungs, his liver. I'd seen them before, many times. Once triggers of fear, now a pathetic cry for attention and proof of his insecurity. Maybe he was human after all.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Bobby enamered by Cartel money</Title>
            <Synopsis>Bobby in works the tunnels and see for himself the weaknesses in security that David had mention, but Bobby just dismissed it. He avoids the bosses to keep from having to answer questions about Davids absence. He thinks about the farmers from town who have given their lives to build this drug tunnel. Bobby want in on all this money. Dams David if his disappearance messes the up for him. 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>That night hadn't been Bobby’s turn to drive the boys in, but it made him feel in control. He felt stupid stopping to pick up a dead-man, but things had to appear normal. How long would it be before the boss's came asking about David? Bobby wasn’t in any hurry to deal with that since he had vouched for David. 
 Bobby pulled onto the road to the old mine, almost cutting off another truck so that he'd been in the middle of a group of other trucks. He’d be less noticeable in the middle. 
The five trucks parked side by side, and four to seven men piled out of each one. They were farmers and shop owners whose shops weren’t doing well; all were down on their luck, angry, and in desperate need of money to feed their families. The men grouped together and moved as one towards the work site. Bobby maneuvered his way into the the pact. Most of the men walked in silence looking down and the ground. Bobby used the cover of the group to eye the surrounding buildings, wondering if his sister was in one of them. Had to be. Why else hadn't she returned?
A ways down, the men split up according to the work assignments. Months ago, on Bobby’s first day, he had been stoked that he got assigned to the tunnel. The hard and dangerous work paid the best. A fight broke out on Bobby’s first day. Another man, who had been there longer, got bumped from line and Bobby got the prime slot. For once in his life things went Bobby’s way. The bosses got a twofer: Bobby could dig like the rest, but he could also fix anything that might break along the way. Before Bobby arrived, if something broke they’d radio for the mechanic and it would take him while to arrive. The guy could fix anything, but he was too old to dig, with lungs too weak for the bad tunnel air. 
Bobby was amazed at what these guys planned to accomplish. Over time he learned that the 1.5 mile tunnel would go from the XXXRanch just east of Jackson across the boarder and come out in a shop east of Agua de vida. The entrance on the Jackson side was creatively camouflaged within the Casino construction, which covered the entrance to the old mine. The Agua de vida side, the tunnel opened up to a shop on Cally 6 right next door to the migrant rescue center, Centro de Atención al Migrante Exodus, or CAME as most everyone called it. 
By the time David started, the 900 yards of tunnel was all the way through, but far from complete. The bosses had forced the tunnel diggers to take short-cuts to speed up the time line. Cracking the tunnel open through both ends, in record time was achieved by lengthening the spaces between the concrete shores, and none of the walls had yet been sprayed with concrete which would normally be done along the way. The shortcuts greatly increased the danger and at least ten men lost their lives––nothing compared to the drugs and money they processed through the tunnel. Even with all the construction still going on they could process XX pounds per week. When it was fully up and running the projections were XX pounds per day. 

Bobby wondered what they had done with the bodies of the tunnel diggers who died. They left their homes one night, and never returned. Their families pasted "Missing" signs everywhere. They visited the police station every day to see if there was any news, but the police were bought and paid for; so, there was never any news. During Sunday services, their families asked for prayers for the safe return of their loved ones. Bobby wasn’t much of a family man, but the families’ haunted him. With David dead, Susan she might as well be dead if the cartel had her, he wondered who would grieve for him. Maybe today was the day he wouldn’t come home. But who would notice?
The grief of the families was quickly replaced by Bobby’s amazement of what they had accomplished. He stood at the Agua de vida end of the tunnel where there was a elevator door. It went up to a large room about five feet below the a pharmacy on Cally 6 street. Last week he was set up in the elevator to fix some machinery in the back office of the Pharmacy. Few steps up led to a hidden door in the floor of the back office in the pharmacy. Bobby marveled at the ingenuity. 
The floor of the back room was covered in a patch work of uneven surfaces including old tiles, linoleum, patches of wood planks, plain concrete, and splotches of carpet. The hatch door was hidden in plain site among the random, well worn, chaotic pattern. The door itself, two inch steel padded on both sides so that when you walked over it even with woman’s heels, it didn’t sound any different than the rest of the floor. 
Bobby wasn’t anxious to take another trip up the elevator. Once the doors opened on to Mexico, although just feet away from Jackson, it was a different world. More like a war zone than a town, he thought. The risks these guys took was immense. But the gains were worth it. As soon as the light of day was shinning through the Agua de vita side of the tunnel, the shipments of drugs and money started. Bobby had seen wagons full of cocaine bricks being transported through the tunnel from Mexico to the US side since the elevator became functional. //timeline. 
As he approached the elevator, Bobby saw an unattended wagon containing drugs and money. During David’s first week in the tunnel he had pointed out to Bobby that with their rush to open for business, their security was weak. They left themselves open, David had said. Bobby thought they were just trash talking about how these drug runner couldn’t run a business. But now, Bobby saw it first hand.
He stared into the wagon, and realized David had been planning, not just talking. Had he stolen from the Cartel? Holy shit. 
"Back up, you ma-tha-fucka," said some big burley dude Bobby didn't want to cross. 
Bobby threw his hands up as if surrendering, and backed away. "Hey, just keeping it safe until you came along." 
"Get back to work." 
"Sure man. Sure." Bobby turned and walked back into the tunnel even though he had been waiting on the elevator. 
All that money! Damn, they got their shit together. These were definitely guys Bobby wanted to be around, move up the ranks. If only he could get past the whole David thing. David. First my farm, and now this opportunity. If you wasn’t dead, I’d kill you myself.

Maybe use work assignments  - guy who didn't get job and Bobby did - to have that guy threaten bobby and bobby thinks it is the cartel.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie &amp; Jo walk home</Title>
            <Synopsis>(Sunday - same day after church) Suzie and Jo walk home and discuss Jeb's store, the construction crew, Aiden and Jacob. Jo decides to have a belated 'welcome home' part for Aiden, and gets Suzie to agree to come. Jump into lake to have fun. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Not too far down the road,  Jo Manwell, Aiden’s younger sister, yelled, "Hey, wait up." 
Jeb was her Pa, and he hated that Jo treated me as a friend. She was six months younger than me, but unlike me, she’d graduated high school, and was attending Junior College. Before I’d left school to help around the farm, she and I were thick as day-old oatmeal from the fridge. 
We had competed for who got the best grades. It started when we both had Mrs. Jones. She had coached us to push each other, to make us both better, she’d say. Jo and me kept at it until I left school. Jo always won the science stuff, while I had her in math and geography. No one came close. Mrs. Jones even had us in special, advanced books. We found them fun.
All that was before the first baby died, and before Aiden became smitten with Bee.
I waited for her to catch up. "Hey, Jo. What’s up?" 
"Same old, same old. Have you heard from Jacob?" 
Jo and Jacob dated for years, up until he had left for Iraq.
"Not a word." 
"Oh." Her smile disappeared.
"You neither?"
"Nope."
We walked in silence for a while. I hadn’t thought much about Jacob since he left. He was out from under pa, that’s what mattered. He was better off, even if he was in a war. Pretty sure he didn’t look back, so didn’t see much purpose in me doing so either. But when Jo said his name, I couldn’t help but worry, hope he was okay, and wonder if I’d ever see him again. Regardless of the outcome of the war, no reason for him to return here. No reason at that I could imagine. 
"Aiden, says hey," Jo said. 
It never failed. Just the sound of Aiden’s name and I felt his lips on mine, his soft hands pressing on my back, pulling me in closer. It was years ago, but it felt like yesterday. A stupid school-girl muse. I shook it off. 
"So listen, why don’t you come over next Saturday, we’ll throw on some hamburgers, and call it the welcome home party for Aiden that we never had." 
Being store owners, the Manwells had more money than most, but that wasn’t saying much. They were still poor by most standards; however, by the looks of the Corner Store’s books, they were bringing in a lot more since last year. I had asked Mrs. Jones about it, hoped I hadn’t made a mistake in the accounting, and she said the store did seem a lot busier in the last few months, then she took the books away to review them. 
"You want me to come too?" I asked. 
"Of course, silly, who else?" 
"Ok. I’ll ask Pa."
"Girl, you’re 18 now. You still need your Pa's permission?" 
"His house, his rules, as he reminds me daily."
"Funny. Like he could do without you. You’ve always done the brunt of the work on that farm and take his shit. I don’t know how you do it." 
"Why do you think he came back?" I deflected.
"Aiden? Well, to help Pa and me, I suppose. You know, family’s family." Jo said. 
No, I didn’t know. Her definition of family and mine were quite different. 	"Would you come back?" I asked. 
"You mean when I finish college?" Jo pondered, "I used to say no-way. But that’s different. Pa doesn’t need me. He doesn’t let me do anything around the store except sweep. I’m sure he could figure that out." Jo laughed. "But all the new business from the construction crews and their bosses––man they have a lot of bosses and they dress in designer jeans, and wear jackets and gold watches," she said sounding amazed. "Anyway, I’m real busy in the store. People coming and going from open to close. So, I don’t care much about leaving anymore, especially since Aiden’s back. And really, where would I go?" 
She stopped and grabbed my arm as she looked at me all dramatic like. "Besides," she paused as she tilted her head, batted her fake-coquette eyes and smiled like a Cheshire cat, " Jacob might not be able to find me if I leave." She looked ridiculous, and she knew it. We laughed so hard my belly hurt, although I understood that inside, she ached. 
Once we recovered, we walked, soaking in the beautiful day: the sun bright, the air hot but not oppressive. A slight breeze, and Jo by my side offered a breath of hope. Hope I didn’t recognize. I’d learned to not rely on others. People just seemed to disappoint. But, for the moment, I welcomed her friendship.
"That sermon. What was that?" Ideas ping-ponged in my head. 
"Who knows? He sure was droning on about something, though. You’d think the world was coming to an end," said Jo.
"Did you see the guys in the back? Who were they?"
"They looked like part of that construction crew I mentioned. Pa said to pay them no mind, and to stay out of their way." Jo sounded like a recorded playback of something her Pa had told her.
"Hmm." The construction crew again. Odd. No building going on around here as far as I could see. The last real building was when the Michelin plant came in, Michelin plant came in, and they promised to buy up 100%  the cotton the farmers could produce for their tires. Then the bottom fell out of cotton and they could buy it cheaper than we could produce it. 
Funny how it works, the price of cotton skyrocketed because of the drought, but nobody had any to sell. That’s the way it worked—high prices meant no cotton, low prices, bumper crops. Never seen an in-between; weather too disappoints. There was no safety in being a farmer. 
"What are they building?"
"No idea, but I hope it’s one of those new movie theaters, the ones with the reclining seats."
"So business is good because of the construction crew?" She forgot I’ve never been to the movies, much less one with recliner seats. 
"Yeah, better than ever," Jo added as she stopped to pick up some stones. She tossed them across the dirt like skipping stones across a pond. "But it’s weird." 
"Weird? How?" I watched a rabbit skitter away when one of Jo’s stones that came too close. 
"Well, we’re busier than ever, and Pa still nags about how we don’t have enough money. And the crew bosses, pa don’t seem to like them much, even though he let’s them camp out in our back room most days. Says it’s to make sure we’ve stocked the stuff they need." She tossed another stone and hit a cactus. "You’d expect he'd at least be nice to them, seeing they are the reason we have so much more business."
"At least I’m not the only customer he treats like shit." I nudged her with my elbow and we both laughed. 
Definitely weird, though. Their books said they had tons of money. Probably her Pa just being stingy. Jo wasn’t aware I helped Mrs. Jones with the books, so I didn’t mention it. Mrs. Jones stressed never to share somebody’s elses’ business. But a while back, when I did the books for The Corner Store, they were almost out-of-business. A few months before Aiden returned from college and took the books back, things had turned around, and their sales were doubling each month. It was right around the same time Father Joe disappeared, and Father John was brought in. I remembered that cause Jo’s Pa, paid for a big reception. He said it was to "help the town heal and welcome in the new Preacher," but it surprised everyone. Generosity was not the bedrock of Mr. Manwell’s reputation. 
"The business doing good, this new?" I probed. 
"Naw, about the last few months I guess." 
That tracked. 
Jo continued, "I know that 'cause that’s when I started getting new clothes." She twirled, showing off her new dress. 
"Nice." I bobbed my head and smiled. Guess her Pa wasn’t being too stingy after all. Something seemed off, though. That had to be one big construction crew to bump business as much as I saw. I’d have to ask Mrs. Jones.
The lake came into view. We looked at each other and grinned from ear to ear. Stripping to our chonies, we jumped in. It didn't matter we might be seen, we laughed and splashed until we were exhausted. This moment, life was good. 

When I was back at the house, Ma and I kept trading glances, wondering when Pa was going to retaliate for how ever Mrs. Jones got him to agree to let me continue to work with her. But he never did. He acted his usual self: guzzling his beer and demanding his dinner. 
I wondered if Mrs. Jones hadn’t understood Pa. Was he really going to let me continue to see her, and keep my money?

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Aiden decides not to tell FBI about kidnapping </Title>
            <Synopsis>Angel tells Aiden about Suzie being kidnapped. Aiden and Mrs. Jones realize they have to loop in the FBI.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Angel busted through the front of Jeb's store with his head on a swivel. Aiden managed to catch his eye, and motioned for him to go around back. 
By the time Aiden got outside, Angel was, panting, pacing and wringing his hand.
"They took her. They took her. What do we do?" Angel said tugging at Aiden's arm. 
"Whoa, Angel. Slow down." The calm in Aiden's voice seems to slow Angel down. 
"The Cartel. They took Suzie." 
"What? How? When?" 
Angel told Aiden about the second threat that he helped deliver. 
"I knew it was her," Aiden said. 
"So Suzie thought they'd for sure deliver her Ma to the diner, but they got the jump on her instead." 
"How long ago?" 
"I ran right here, so no more than ten maybe 15 minutes? They tossed her in a dark blue Ford Pickup and drove in the direction of the mine."
"Angel, you did great. Thank you. I'll take it from here. Now get out of here before someone see you."

Aiden arranged to meet Mrs. Jones at the garage. There he relayed what Angel had seen.
"I'm going to kill her if they don't." Aiden's face was flush, his veins pulsed. "What are we going to do?" 
"We've got to tell the FBI. Suzie's in serious trouble, and maybe her Ma too." //Todo/confirm when Aiden finds out that Susie's Ma is dead 
"Why should they believe us? There's no evidence they have either of them."
"You infiltrated the Cartel for them, to help them build a case. If there ever was a time to leverage your relationship, now is it. 
"No. No. They'll charge in––you saw the chaos they caused in town when they raided the cleaners, christ you would have thought they were breaking into Fort Knox––and before they even get within a half-mile of the motorhome their sentries will have sounded the alarm, and, for sure, they'll kill her and her Ma before the FBI set foot in the camp. No, I can't risk it." </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Bobby Recruits David (Pa)</Title>
            <Synopsis>(Monday morning) Bobby talks David into joining him in the tunnel dig for the Cartel. David is reluctant, but with the drought, and looming bank loan he agrees and joins Bobby, but understand it must be done it total secret, during the night. </Synopsis>
            <Text>"Ya-hoo," yelled Bobby, hanging out the window of his new yellow Camaro as he raced it down the dirt road. At the edge of the field he skidded the car to a stop in a swirl of dust. It’s a great day, he thought. 
"What the hell, Bobby? You're the yahoo," said David, Bobby’s brother-in-law, choking on the air thick with dirt. 
Bobby jumped out of the car. "Well, whatcha think?" he asked as he shuffled around the car with his arms out, Vanna-White-style, showing-off the grand prize. 
"Shit-head. You can’t afford this." 
 Bobby got in David’s face. "I sure can. But you can’t. So, I guess that makes you the shit-head. Ha!" He nudged David with the tips of his fingers. 
"Get out of my face." David pushed back harder. Bobby backed off.
"Come on, Davie. Don’t be like that." Bobby had called him Davie since they were kids. He was the only one who got away with it, but not if said outside of family, and Bobby had the scar to prove it. 
"Better not let Susan see that thing," David said.
"What she gonna do about it, anyway?" Bobby puffed his chest out. "Not sure why I put up with her shit. One of these days I’m going to give my sister a piece of my mind." Bobby pulled a rag from his back pocket and dusted the chrome fender. "I need to take a page from my daddy’s playbook, like you, and put her in her place." 
 David just laughed at him and turned back to pulling out the oil pan on the tractor.
"You hear about what happened at Jeb's yesterday?" asked Bobby. 
David didn't look up. "Someone stealing, I heard. Was it Suzie?" 
"Suzie? No. It was my boss's son--a stupid redheaded Mexican. His Pa's got serious juice. Jeb just let him walk and with an extra six pack to boot."
David stopped his work and eyed Bobby's car. "You got that by digging for that same boss? The thing you told me about before?" David asked.
"That’s right, I took––ini-tia-tive." All proud because he got hired before David and without his help. 
"And THAT, you better never let Susan find out about. One more strike and you’re out. With her, and the law." 
"Yeah, yeah, whatever. She don't own me." Bobby slipped in next to David and took over the mechanic work. "You don’t know shit about engines." 
The two men worked side by side, the morning sun beating down, sweat dripping from their foreheads. They stood on the land once owned for two generations by Bobby and Susan’s parents; the tractor was almost as old. It should all have been Bobby’s when their daddy died, but Bobby was in jail for breaking and entering. He had been a person-of-interest in a still open murder case but they didn't have enough evidence for the murder but turned up the theft during the investigation. He had stolen car parts out of a junk yard for an old clunker he’d won in a back alley craps game. He was fixing it up, seeing how that was the only way he’d ever have a car. His daddy, who called Bobby 'Raca' from the bible meaning 'foolish', beat him stupid for getting caught, yelling at him that only idiots steal from junk yards. "Smart folk steal electronics, jewelry, or other high-end crap that you can sell for real cash," his pa yelled. 
In prison, Bobby took to new skills. Ones that kept him safe and in cigarettes. He got beat up more times than he could count. Everything he learned in prison prepared him for his new employer. Real cash––Bobby never forgot that lesson. 
"I know I’ve asked you..." Bobby started. 
"Several times, in fact," interrupted David.
"Yea, but things are worse now. The rain never stayed away this long. Back then you might have salvaged some of the crop, but now," they both looked over dry useless field, "there ain’t nothing." Bobby silently resented David for getting the family farm, but looking over this cemetery of a farm, he felt he got the better end of the deal. 
"Why so intent on me joining you?" David said.
"Money brother. What else? You it." Bobby gloated, not often able to one-up David. "And the only reason you’re not jumping-in is because I did it first." 
"And..." David raised one eyebrow examining Bobby. 
"And, eh, well, I do get a small bonus for bringing in someone like you," he blurted in one breath. 
"And there it is," David said turning back to his tinkering on the tractor. 
"Now come on, Davie. Both can be true. You do need the money, and so what if I get a buck-fifty from it." 
"A hundred and fifty dollars? Just for bringing me on?" 
"Yep." Bobby’s confidence swelled. "And that's nothing compared to the nightly take." 
"Okay, I'll bite. How much?" 
"Five hundred bucks a night." Bobby waited for David’s reaction. 
"Fuck me." David shook his head. "But once you start, there ain’t no turning back." 
"And that's to start." Bobby pressed, determined to get him to listen. "Work five to six hours a night. Work as many nights you want, and when you build up nights, your pay goes up. And that doesn’t count the extra bonuses for re-crui-ting," Bobby exaggerated each syllable making it sound like some highfalutin word, "and other stuff like extra feet through, handling explosives--that kind of stuff. I don’t understand it all yet, but I do understand the money!" 
"God." David said under his breath. "$500 a night." He wiped the wrench with a dirty rag. 
"And besides, your pig-headedness ain’t going change anything. They’re here and they’re staying, with more on the way. With more work after this. Might as well join them now," Bobby let it sink-in. "You never wanted to be a farmer. Think of it, you can get out from under the debt, and do what you want to do, not what my daddy forced on you." Bobby threw the rag down and ran his fingers through his hair. He took a deep breath and started again. "Think of it this way, God’s handing you this op-por-tun-nity. Wouldn’t be right to say no to God, now would it?"
David scoffed and continued to assist Bobby with the tractor. 
"There. Done," Bobby said as he tightened the last bolt. They both stood and admired their work. "You know this thing won’t last another season. Even I can’t fix it much longer. Too much duct tape and bailing wire." Bobby tossed his wrench into the tool box.
David frowned and gazed out across the barren field. </Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.

How To Use This Template
	•	Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	⁃	Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
	•	Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
	⁃	You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
	⁃	To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
	⁃	Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
	⁃	You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
	1.	Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
	2.	If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
	3.	Click on the chevron next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view. (Note that only folders with content show chevrons.)
	•	A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.

Compiling
	•	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.
	•	Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

	•	To compile to standard manuscript format:
	◦	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
	◦	Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you chosen).
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to paperback PDF format:
	◦	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
	◦	Select “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to ebook format:
	◦	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/EBook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
	◦	Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).
	⁃	You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “EBook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
	⁃	Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon’s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
	⁃	To create an ePub file, choose the “ePub 3” format.
	⁃	To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle KF8/Mobi” format.
	⁃	“ePub 2” and “Kindle Mobi” are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.
	◦	Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
	◦	Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
	⁃	Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
	⁃	Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
	•	Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
	1.	Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
	2.	Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
	3.	Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
	•	Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document:
	1.	At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.
	2.	Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
	•	Page size: The “Paperback” format is set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and is a popular size for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
	1.	Ctrl-click on the “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
	2.	Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The window will change size and content.
	3.	In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (6” x 9”)”).
	4.	Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
	5.	Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
	6.	In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, select “Manage Custom Sizes…” from the “Paper Size” pop-up button.
	7.	Click the “+” button to add a new custom size and give it a name.
	8.	Enter the paper width and height. (Note this is Apple’s standard Page Setup panel, and the units it displays are determined in System Preferences under “Language &amp; Region” &gt; “Advanced…”.)
	9.	Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
	10.	Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
	•	Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
	2.	To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
	3.	To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
	•	Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
	1.	Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
	2.	Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
	3.	Create a new text document for each chapter.
	4.	Go to Project &gt; Project Settings and select “Section Types”.
	5.	Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
	6.	Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
	7.	In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Root files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
	•	Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
	1.	Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
	2.	Name the document “Contents”.
	3.	In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).
	4.	For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit &gt; Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List.
	5.	Click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
	6.	If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.
	7.	If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
	8.	In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”. Now, when you Compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” format.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Synopsis>(Two weeks later? ) Suzie spies on Pa has he returns from one of the nightly outings with Bobby and four other men. She sees him untape wrapped white bricks, and wrapped money from his legs, belly, and back, then go deep into the desert, and returns without them. Suzie is caught spying on him and is beaten, Bee is raped in order for Pa to be able to sleep. Does she really need to be raped again? Maybe too much? Questions Ma to see if she knows about Pa going out at night, and it appears as though she does. Suzie doesn't understand and criticizes Ma - who reacts by almost hitting Suzie - but doesn't. Ends with Ma crying (feeling terrible for almost hitting Suzie) about being just like Pa - and Suzie comforting her saying it's okay. </Synopsis>
            <Text>The floorboards in our old house talked to me through their thuds and creaks, whispers of quiet footsteps or threatening stomps. Some spoke louder than others. Muted thuds spoke to normal, normal as normal goes for this house. But thunderous pounding shouted––time to go into hiding. The telltale soft ones whispered deception and a sure sign of things never to mention––I know, cause it was usually me making them. 
Tonight, after midnight, soft footfalls screamed someone was up to no-good. It was pa. I stood by the door, not breathing, hoping he wasn’t looking to fetch Bee. But he passed without stopping, and I exhaled. The front door opened. I peeked out, and he slithered onto the porch. 
Where was he going so late? I snuck to the front door, staying low so he wouldn’t see me, and peered through the curtains. Uncle Bobby’s truck rolled in with his headlights off, engine quiet. Pa trotted through the yard and jumped into the truck bed, joining five other men. I didn’t recognize two of them other than to say they came late to church, sat in the rear pews and left early. Not sure about the rest, but their dirty overalls and sweat-stained caps along with their ragged shirts and shit-covered shoes underscored their farmer roots and harsh times. 
They drove off with no lights. 
I looked in on ma to make sure she was okay and cracked her door so I could check on her later. 
Tossing and turning, I got up several times to see if pa had returned, but Ma’s door wasn’t disturbed. Bee was safe with me. Late into the night, the crunch of tires rolling on dirt woke me; it was Bobby’s truck again. The men looked like they had wrestled a dust devil but lost: thick layers of silt covered their clothes, encased their hair, and plastered their skin. Even the whites of their eyes, reddened by grit. 
I watched as pa got off the truck. His step, awkward. 
I flinched below the sill. Crawled towards my bedroom. A shadow passed the window in the kitchen. I glanced at the front door. No movement there, only the sound of the truck rolling down the road. I crept to the kitchen window on the side of the house. I leaned over the counter to peek out. Pa pulled up his shirt and yanked at something near the small of his back. He tossed another package. It bounded under a shrub. From under his belt, he took out another pouch. With both packets on the ground, he stood motionless under the new moon. With a seriousness I thought he saved only for Bee, he stared deep into the darkness of the night. A shiverer crawled up my spine. I ducked below the windowsill but crept up. I couldn’t believe what I saw next. 
Pa unbuckled his belt and took off his pants. Two more pouches, one duck-taped to each thigh. He ripped the tape with the speed of a gasoline fire ripping through a tinder box. His faced grimaced, but he made no sound. He lifted off his shirt, revealing a smaller pouch taped just above the top of his belly and under his chest. His snake tattoo looked even more sinister in the dark.
Once he had stripped the five pouches from his body, pa jumped into his jeans. He laid his shirt flat on the ground and gathered up his stash. He scanned the grounds like a forward scout before heading into the back yard. 
I took my first breath. My pulse raced, heart pounded. I shuffled to the rear porch. 
But I was too late. He had slid into the blackness. 
I waited and waited. What was he doing? 
The quiet soothed me. The darkness enveloped me. 

"What the hell?" The screen door slammed. 
Pa kicked me awake. 
"What did you see?" Pa poised to hit. 
"Nothing, nothing." I scrambled out of his reach. My hand rubbed my side, but I refused to cry. "It was cooler out here. That’s all. I was sleeping." 
"You better not be lying to me, girl." He glared at me. 
I stood. Emboldened by his secret, I stepped towards him. "Ma know about your escapades?" 
"Ma?" He laughed. "You’re stupider than you look." 
What? She knew? 
"You saw nothing. Know nothing. Got it?" His statement punctuated by a blow into my stomach, so hard the next thing I remembered, I was in my bedroom with Bee, both of us exhausted and spent. 

Before the drought, pa rose first, earlier than sunup. He worked the farm harder than most. Determined, I'd hear people say, to make it work, determined to differ from his daddy. Hard work––he taught me that. Gave you a purpose. He never gave up. So I guess you could say I respected him for that. 
Last few months, after his late-night excursions, he slept in past 9 am., three to four times a week. This morning, we had fed the chickens, collected two eggs, fed and milked Betty, and swept the barn. Ma had prepared a big breakfast, something she took to fixing after pa’s outings. 
We sat at the breakfast table. Ma placed a plate in front of pa, heaping with scrambled eggs, bacon, and biscuits with gravy. He dug in like a Javelina on a fruited prickly pear. Didn’t notice ma and me had toast. 
Pa looked tired, even old. He must have felt me gawking cause he stopped eating and locked eyes with me. I held his stare. His eyes… what was it in his eyes… anger?… fear? 
But it passed. 
He finished up his food, and left without saying a word, or even nodding goodbye.
The anxiety pa infused lingered until we finished our coffee.
"Well, I better get to washing and sewing. You best get to studying." 
The second year of the drought, ma took in washing and sewing to help out. Pa didn’t take too kindly to it, said he could take care of his family, but that was when the farm produced. Now, he just ignored the extra money. Ma did her work when he wasn’t around, which, for me, couldn’t be often enough. Between her sewing and washing, my bookkeeping with Mrs. Jones, pickings I sold on the sly, food stamps and farmers’ subsidies––we got by. The real problem was the bridge loan we used to buy the supplies needed for this year’s crop. The bank had extended it from last year, and not likely to extend it again. Losing our land, well, I can’t even imagine what that would do to ma. 
"I’ll help you," I said. 
"Oh, no you don’t. Do your studying. You're gonna make something of yourself."
“Think pa is going to let me continue working with Mrs. Jones?" 
"If Caroline says she'll get him to agree," she lowered her sewing to her lap as she peered out the window. "Then, he'll agree." 
My face asked, “What does that mean?” But she ignored me.
After a while, she paused her stitching. “He wasn’t always so mean.” 
"Pa?" 
"Yeah, your pa." She focused on her stitches. "The good just pushed down by a hard life, and rough times." 
I remembered when he wasn’t as angry, he didn’t hit us near as much, and when he had, we usually earned it. Can’t say he was ever a good man though, but a long time ago, wasn’t near as mean. 
With her talk of pa, I broached the subject of last night. "So, you okay pa goes out at night?" 
 Ma didn’t miss a beat. "Your pa's no stranger to doing things he has to.” She fiddled her wedding band. “You’ll learn one day. Best to let things go." 
She knew. 
"So where does he go? This isn’t the first time either." I thought it best not to mention the bundles taped to his body. 
"And minding your own business. You gotta learn that too." 
"Well, isn’t it our business what pa does?" I slammed my book closed. 
"No. Especially what pa does." Her eyes on me now. 
"But how can we make things right if we won’t admit it’s wrong?"
"Ain't that the pot calling the kettle black.” Ma looked up.
She seemed to be waiting for a reaction. 
"It's wrong, I tell you. Preacher said faith isn’t sticking your head in the ground and hoping God fixes the rest. He said we have to take a stand. A stand against evil." I reached for my water from the side table and took a sip. 
"Evil, is it?" Her voice raised. "Your imagination runs wild. Pa’s taking care of his family, so that's evil, is it?" 
Water spit out everywhere. I blurted though it, "Since when does Pa take care of us?" 
Ma’s body went ridged. She tossed her sewing aside and moved toward me. She lifted her hand; our gazes’ clenched. Neither moved. 
Closest she had ever come to hitting me. 
She stormed out of the living room crying. "There’s just so much you don’t understand."
I followed her into her bedroom where she laid on the bed crying. Spooning her from behind, I smoothed her hair, over and over, as her body shook. "It’s okay, ma. It’s going to be okay. You didn’t mean it." I stroked her head. "You’re not like pa. It’s okay." The grief and longing of her tears infected me with sadness. </Text>

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) FBI raids drycleaners, finds no money</Title>
            <Synopsis>Plan works. FBI raids the store. Cartel men see it happen but can't stop it. The FBI don't find any money in the safe (because Suzie already stole it), but according to the owner they weren't supposed to get a drop until later that day (owners are in on it and lied). The Cartel thinks the FBI has seized their funds. </Synopsis>
            <Text>I sat on a bench where I could see both the front of the dry cleaners and the entrance to the ally. No unusual activity, and no Cartel people had been in or out all morning. Around eleven, things changed. 
The usually peaceful town erupted with sirens and flashing lights. Eight vehicles in all. Several men in swat gear, and others in white shirts and ties, all carrying a firearm and wearing body armor––stormed the dry cleaners. The other store owners were on the street watching the raid go down with what looked like a combination of fear and hope. 
The tattooed, dry cleaner clerk spit into the face of an FBI agent, the real-life manifestation of the big-brother she feared has hauled her out of the store. She stood out front shivering with anger while the sun beat down on her. Four men, the same men in church that day when Father John gave his final sermon only to be found naked in the Colorado river a week later, stood in the shadows down the street. A Clark Kent looking man in a cheap black suit, white shirt, black tie and black rimmed glasses. After taking an envelop, counting the money inside, he left. They others made calls on several cells phone, one after the other. They paced, and waved their hands. 
The big bosses know. Maybe now they'll take me seriously. Time for phase two. 



Aiden and Mrs. Jones worked from his garage. Aiden's phone rang. "Aiden here." He looked over at Mrs. Jones. "Understood, but my truck is acting up. I know, I'll have Bobby drive me." 
Mo said, "Whatever. Just get here." 
Aiden clicked off the call, then dial another number. 
"What's happening?" Mrs. Jones asked.
Aiden held up one finger to Mrs. Jones. "Bobby," Aiden said into his phone, "El Brutal's called an emergency meeting and he wants you there too. My truck's on the fritz, pick me up on your way." 
"When?" Bobby asked. 
"Now."
Aiden's phone pinged with a text message. "I gotta go. Get here right away." Aiden read the text. A coded message from the FBI who also insisted on a meeting with him. 
"Somethings happened." Aiden read the text to Mrs. Jones. 
He texted back, 'Out fishing. Catch you when I can' which was their agreed upon message if Aiden was meeting with the Cartel. 
Mrs. Jones cell rang. Aiden said, "If they can't get me, you're up." 
"Hello?" Mrs. Jones answered her phone.
"Meet us at the same spot where we originally met," the FBI handler stated. 
"Why what's going on?" Mrs. Jones shrugged her shoulders at Aiden. 
"Be there. 30 minutes." 
Mrs. Jones phone went dead. 
"First the Cartel calls an emergency meeting, then the FBI is frantic and needs to talk to one of us. What's going on here?" Aiden said. 
"I don't know, but be careful. Something's off," Mrs. Jones said as she and Aiden walked out the door.

            <Title>&lt;$n&gt;) Suzie accepts Aiden's help</Title>
            <Synopsis>Aiden confronts Suzie. Suzie opens up to him about the drugs and money her Pa stole. He confesses why he is working with the FBI: to save his Pa from prosecution as his Pa was threatened into agreeing to help the Cartel with their money laundering. Suzie gets Aiden to agree to call the FBI the day after the raid.  </Synopsis>
            <Text>	"What did you do?" Aiden said to Suzie. 
	"What are you talking about," said Suzie. 
	"Return Ma and Bee? Suzie we talked about this. You can't go after these guys." 
	I wasn't sure how to react. His soft voice and and warm touch as he caressed my upper arms, belied the concern of his words. Was he concerned about me, or himself?
	"I'm not sure what you're talking about." I dodged his look. 
	"Suzie, we can't keep on like this." Aiden guided me by my shoulder to the couch. "I'm not sure what is going on with you, but I care about you. More than you realized, I'm sure. I'm worried about you. These guys are bad news." 
It was the first time Aiden and I had talked calmly is a while. His voice was warm. I searched his eyes for meaning. He didn't reflect the kind of duplicity that I saw in Bobby's eyes. His reflected back something I wasn't familiar with. What ever it was, it calmed me. 
"What about Bee?" I softened my eyes but held my stare. 
Aiden sighed. "Let's just focus on you, and Bee will take care of herself. You know that. It's you I'm interested in." 
"Pa's alive."
"What?" Aiden moved closer holding my hand in his. 
First time in a while, I felt safe. His warmth, his strength was comforting. 
"I saw him at the mine." 
"Oh my god, Suzie. Are you alright? That must have been awful." He pulled me in and hugged me. 
I hated crying, but I couldn't stop myself. I had never grieved the loss of Pa, and now he is alive grief overwhelmed me. I sobbed uncontrollably into his chest while he caressed my hair, and reposted, "It's okay, everything is going to be alright." 
After a few minute, I had exhausted my tears. I pulled up to see he checks were wet. I wiped his cheek with my hand. 
"I'm not sure why I'm crying. I'm just so confused."First I believe Ma shot him, that he's dead, then he's alive, and Bobby tells me I shot him." 
"What? Bobby's not known for his honesty. Do you think he's telling the truth?" said Aiden. 
"I didn't at first. But then, I don't know, I've gotten flashes of memory here and there, and yeah, maybe." I shook my head. "But I just can't believe it." 
"Suzie, he hurt you, he abused you and your Ma. It's understandable."
"Ma wouldn't be in this trouble if it hadn't been for me showing Pa. She left to protect me, I get that now." 
"Don't worry it's going to be okay."
"Yea, somehow it will be okay. I've got a plan." 
"Ok, I'm listening. This isn't sounding like you backing off, but I'll listen. You deserve that much." 
I started from the beginning when I overheard him and Mrs. Jones talking about the other stores. Then finding Ma, and losing Bee. He knew about the ransacking of the house and there threatening Cartel note, and I filled him on Bobby's plan to make it all good, and is real agenda to run off with the money. The more I talked the more relieved I felt. Just to have someone listen to me, provided a sense of normalcy I hadn't felt in a long time. I paused and Aiden didn't jump in and start talking or asking questions. He just let the silence mushroom into a cloud of comfort where he held my hand in both of his, and watched me his warm brown eyes. 
"And?" he nudged. 
I stared at him. 
"I know what Pa took." I pulled away slightly. 
"What, Suzie. What did he take?" 
"Don't you know? You work for them." I pulled away even more. 
"Listen. I don't work for them. I'm helping the Feds to shut them down, and get my Pa out of trouble. The Cartel just thinks I work for them." 
"Trouble? What do you mean? What kind of trouble." 
I didn't balk when Aiden moved in closer. ""Last spring I wanted to surprise Pa and Jo and come home early. But I got the surprise instead. I came home to Pa sitting in his easy chair, holding a gun to his head."
"Aiden, no." 
" I got there in time to stop him," said Aiden. "But that was only the beginning. After a lot of conversation, I found out that the Cartel had threatened to kill Jo and me unless Pa worked with them to launder their money." Aiden took a deep breath while holding my hand in both of his. " He had agreed, but after the men in town started going missing, and Father Joe found dead, and Father Ralph went missing - he just cracked, sure that he played a part, however indirectly, in supporting these animals." He closed is eyes and drew in a breath. 
"But he didn't know how to get out. He thought the only way to keep us safe was to kill himself and let the store fall into their hand, and they could do what they wanted with it." His face showed the agony of a son who saw his father wanting to take his life. 
"Aiden, I'm so sorry. I didn't know." 
"You came close, though. When you were doing the books. Caroline had no idea you'd figure it out, but as you got closer, we thought it best we make it look like I was taking them back. But in reality, Caroline stayed on."
"Okay, but I'm lost, how does this lead to you working with the FBI and the Cartel?" Even I heard the palpitating concern in my voice. 
"Well, at the University in Sierra Vista, I was approached by a recruiter. Turns out he was with the FBI. He talked about how the Cartel had really gotten its fangs into the men of the town, capitalizing on the poor economy made worse by the drought. Drug shipments in the rise, new drugs too like Carefentynal. Anyway they need a local who would help them infiltrate the Cartel," Aiden hesitated, "but it wasn't like they were asking for volunteers." 
"What do you mean?" I asked. 
"The FBI knew my dad was in bed with them, they threatened to lock him up, if I didn't help." Aiden took a deep breath. "But I see now that wouldn't have happened. Back then, that was all they had - a suspicion about Pa's store. "I told them about how Pa got involved with them and struck a deal to help them, bring my Pa into the loop, and guarantee he didn't go to jail." 
"Wow," I said shaken off my bewilderment. "I had no idea. So they really didn't have enough on your Pa to threaten you like that?" 
"No, and that's why you heard what you did the other day. I don't completely trust them." 
"What do you mean?" 
"Caroline found other store owners that are under the Cartel's thumb laundering money. I suspect they might have been threatened too. I don't want to alert the FBI just yet. I want to understand the whole picture first." 
"What if we could save Ma &amp; Bee, and put a serious crimp into the Cartels money stash?" 
"We can't take on the Cartel, Suzie. They are just too powerful." 
"I've got a plan," I smiled. 
"What are you going to do?" 
"When's the next drop at the Cleaners?" 
"Tomorrow around 11:00 or 12:00. Again, why?" 
"It's time you told the FBI about the Dry Cleaners being another money laundering outlet, but wait for the day after the drop." 
"I see what you're thinking. They raid the place after the drop and the Cartel is out a lot of dough," Aiden said nodding his head. 
"Something like that. You'll do it?" I asked. 
"What do you mean, something like that?" 
"Will. You. Do. It." I punctuated each word, losing my cool. 
Aiden pursed his lip, glaring at Suzie. Two breaths later, he said, "Alright."
"Good," I nodded. "One more thing..."
