(Saturday) Suzie goes to work for Mrs. J. Mrs. J gives Suzie a dollar to mark so that she can start to learn to "follow the money". Mrs. J hint at a history between Ma and Jeb. She also gently presses Suzie about Bee and tries to help her see the truth (cautiously as she eyes the scars on Suzie's wrists). Next day, (Sunday) Mrs. J confronts Suzie's Pa to let Suzie study and work with her. When she tells Ma and Suzie they can't believe it, and think they will get a beating because Pa will think they put her up to it. But when they get back to the house, Pa is his normal self. Suzie thinks Mrs. J might not have understood Pa.
