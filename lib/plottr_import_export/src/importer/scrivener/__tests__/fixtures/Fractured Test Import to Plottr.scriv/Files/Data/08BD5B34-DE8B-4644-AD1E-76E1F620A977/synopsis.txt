Suzie presses Aiden for info on tunnel and evil influence. She has seen him with some of the evil people at his dad's store asking him specifically about the man with the gold truck. Suzie confides in him showing him the threatening note, and tells him Pa is dead and Cartel has Ma and Bee. He tells her about the Chinolas Cartel and what they are doing. Aiden is working for them but is cagey about it (learn later he is working for FBI infiltrating the Cartel). He suggests Suzie go to the FBI. Suzie pushes away his help, and is more determined to find Ma and Bee on her own, and decides to go to the mine to scout it out for herself.
