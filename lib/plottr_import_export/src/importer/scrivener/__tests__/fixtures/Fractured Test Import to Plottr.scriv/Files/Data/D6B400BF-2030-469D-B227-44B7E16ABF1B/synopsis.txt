Cartel does not act on Suzie's threat; they think it is a joke. She ups the game to show them she isn't kidding. She steals from one of their money laundering businesses which just got a large money drop that morning. ***remove part where she takes the papers. Add to somewhere else - maybe takes them from Aiden's garage? He hasn't turned them over yet?? Or steals them from the motor home when she is captured?
