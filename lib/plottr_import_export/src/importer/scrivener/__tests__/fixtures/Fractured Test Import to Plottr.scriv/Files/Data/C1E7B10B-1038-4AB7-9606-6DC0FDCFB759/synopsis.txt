Suzie is in utter despair. Doesn't know what to do, doesn't want to go on. She has a choice - to tell the FBI and get Pa arrested for killing Ma, which likely will hinder her chances of getting Bee freed; or should she can go after Bee and let Pa get away with murdering Ma (because he will have to leave town when FBI start hauling in the Cartel and she doesn't think the FBI will find him). At home, Suzie finds Bobby, fights (as in fist fights) with him and tells him Pa is alive, and Ma is dead - how can that be?? ***Bobby confesses that Pa wasn't dead when they put him in the truck, but that Susan said "she'd take care of that - he was as good as dead."
