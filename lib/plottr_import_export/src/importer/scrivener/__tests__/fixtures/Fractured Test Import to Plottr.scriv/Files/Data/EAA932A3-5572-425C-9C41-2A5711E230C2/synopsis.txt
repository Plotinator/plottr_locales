Suzie contacts (via note written by what looks like her Pa) the Cartel again and threatens more stores will go down if they don't release Ma and Bee. She makes it look like the note is from her Pa. Bobby is there when the note is received and is shocked to see the note is from her Pa, and confirms that to the Cartel. Cartel now thinks Bobby was lying to them about David being dead. Note also threatens to tell the Feds about the tunnel here, and the one in Nogalas (which Suzie learns about from papers in the safe when she stole the money). Angel (Gilberto's son who is "missing") helps with plot.
