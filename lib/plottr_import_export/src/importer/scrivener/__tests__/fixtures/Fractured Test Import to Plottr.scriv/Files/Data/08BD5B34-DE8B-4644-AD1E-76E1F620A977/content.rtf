\f0\fs24 \cf0 When Ma returns, she'll need her money. I replaced both my money-stash and Ma\'92s back in their original hiding places. I kept her diary close at hand. It was too important, too personal to be lying around even in her secret hiding place. \
Straightening up the house helped me think. The mundane task gave my brain a chance to connect the dots. The drugs and money, that's what the note referred to. Who ever my Pa stole from, wants them back. I focused on a plan. At first, I wanted to move the money and drugs again, but thought better of it. They\'92ve already searched this place, no reason for them to search it again, at least not right away. \
The sound of Aiden\'92s car pulling in front of the house distracted me. \
"Suzie, you okay? Was driving by and saw your mailbox bowled over." Aiden opened the front door. "Holy shit, what happened here."\
"What are you doing here?" I said. \
"I was worried about you. Who did this?" \
"You shouldn\'92t be here. You need to go." I didn\'92t bother to look at him; I continued to clean. \
"Whoa, whoa. Stop a minute." Aiden held my shoulders. "Now, tell me what\'92s going on."\
I glared at him. He was keeping me from what I needed to do. \
"Something is clearly not right. Let me help." Aiden released his grip but stood firm. \
"Who owns the gold truck?" I surprised myself with the question, but once it came out, I realized that truck could lead me to Ma and Bee.\
"What? What truck?" Aiden asked. \
"The gold four-door dually that always parks in the first space at your Pa\'92s store. It\'92s there every time I am." \
Realization rippled in Aiden's eyes. He turned away. "Well, he\'92s, you know, a customer." \
"Just a customer. Then why can\'92t you look at me." I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him around. \
"It\'92s a guy from the construction crew working on the new casino. That\'92s all." Aiden looked away again and rubbed his forehead. \
"What else?" I demanded. \
Aiden drew in a breath. With his shoulders straightened, he looked at me again. "Suzie, some things are better left alone. It\'92s none of our business," Aiden said. \
"They made it my business," I said as I righted each of the kitchen chairs. I pointed to the note on the refrigerator. \
Aiden walked over to the refrigerator and read the note. He pulled it off the door and read it again. Shaking his head, he rubbed his forehead again. \
"What do you have of theirs?" he asked. \
"I don\'92t have anything of theirs. But Pa might." He didn\'92t need the details. \
"Where is your Pa, anyway?" \
"Dead." \
"Dead? What do you mean dead?" \
"Dead like in not breathing." I surveyed the can goods, ceral, flour and such strewn across the kitchen floor. \
"Oh, my god." Aiden pressed his fingers to his forehead as if warding off a headache. "How?"\
"What does it matter? He\'92s dead." I re-shelved what food I could salvage.\
"So, let me get his straight. Your Pa, who is now dead, stole something from the people who tore up your place. But based on this note, it looks like they don\'92t know your Pa is dead." \
"That\'92s about it." I moved to the next room, picking up things on the way. "Suzie, slow down," Aiden pleaded, still holding the note. \
"Okay, I\'92ll slow down." I marched straight up to him, toe to toe. "Who owns that truck? And what\'92s going on near the old mill? And don't tell me they're building a casino."\
Aiden looked as if he had seen a ghost. "Why would you ask about that?" \
"Because, the road that leads to the old mine, the road nobody had used for decades, is now secured by a new fence at the entrance camouflaged by brush. A road, I shouldn\'92t know about, that leads to a place where someone might have taken Ma, and won\'92t let her go until Pa returns their 
\f1\i merchandise
\f0\i0 . That someone might be the owner of that gold truck." I spit each word louder than the one before it. Each with increasing intensity. \
 "You don\'92t know what you\'92re talking about. You don't mess with these people." Aiden responded in kind.\
"Well, college boy, they\'92re already messing with me." I pointed to the note in his hand. \
Aiden's crinkled his brow. "You have something of theirs?" he said, staring at the note. \
"You won't find it in that note. I told you, I do not know what they\'92re talking about. But I will get Ma and Bee back safe."\
"Wait? You think they have your Ma?" \
"Yea, and Bee." \
"Whatever." Aiden rolled his eyes. "And your Pa stole from them?" \
I wanted to slap him for dismissing Bee like that. "Whatever? You learn that in college too? That\'92s how you treat your girlfriend?" \
He closed his eyes as he shook his head. "Let\'92s stay focused here. What makes you think they have your Ma?" \
"Who else are they threating to kill. Now, are you going to help me or not?" I felt the blood rushing to my face. If Bee had asked, he\'92d help.\
"Help you do what?" \
"Tell me about the man in the gold truck and what's happening at the old mine." \
"You can\'92t go against these people." \
"What\'92s the problem? You said they were a construction crew?" The sarcasm dripped from every word. \
"Suzie, let\'92s call the authorities." \
"Authorities? You see the way the cops handle things around here. Pa paid off Police and the Social Worker to keep me out of school, folks steal at will in front of the Deputy, and where were they when Father John was killed? Suicide, my ass. Or when Father Joe and several of the town's men went missing. And I\'92m sure as hell not letting Ma and Bee disappear into oblivion like that." \
Aiden shook his head. \
"There are no authorities anymore. Don\'92t you get it." I slapped my palm on the end table. \
"I get it more than you realize," said Aiden. "I wasn\'92t talking about the local police. The FBI." \
"FBI? Yea, right\'96\'96I\'92ve got them on speed dial."\
"Suzie, please. Sit down and listen," Aiden said.\
 I put the books on the bookshelf. \
"I'm serious, Suzie, sit. I can help you." \
Aiden took my arm and guided me into a chair; he sat in the one next to it. I waited for him to talk. \
"That construction crew? They are building more than a casino. They are building a tunnel." He stopped and looked at me. \
"A tunnel? To where? For what?" \
He took my hand. "It\'92s the Chinolas Cartel."\
"The CC13?" Images from the news of full-bodied tatooed men, each branded with CC13 on their foreheads, cheeks or eyelids invaded my senses.  Stories of the of the most notorious and powerful drug cartel in the world, responsible for fire-bombing of tourists, hanging of men in the square, displaying heads on stick in front of police stations, and the raping and torturing women for sport, not to mention flooding America with opioids, cocaine, and fentanyl echoed in my head. \
"Things are coming together." \
"What things?" Aiden looked confused.\
"Never mind. The tunnel?" \
"The tunnel goes from Jackson, near the old Copper mine, across the border to Agua de Vida."\
"That\'92s specific. How do you know all this?" I locked eyes with Aiden, who glanced away. "You\'92re working for them?" \
"It\'92s not what you think, but kind of, yes." \
I stood up so fast the chair flipped to the floor. "So the biggest, most violent drug cartel is building a drug mule superhighway, and you\'92re helping them. Is that what you\'92re saying?" \
Aiden grabbed my hand. "It\'92s not like that\'96\'96" \
"Jesus Christ, my Pa stole from the CC13\'96\'96," My sudden realization shook me. "Brilliant." I pulled my hand away. I felt Aiden's eyes drinking in my every move. Good thing I hadn\'92t mentioned the drugs and money. \
"So, they're expanding their territory from Nogales to Jackson?" I asked. \
"Not so much expanding, they\'92ve been entrenched for a while. Think about it. After the Smelter closed in '87, hundreds of jobs disappeared. The Jackson economy tanked\'96\'96wait, what? Your Pa stole from the cartel? That's what this note is about?" \
I raised my eyebrows, cocking my head. "What does the old Smelter have to do with anything?" \
Aiden whipped his face with his hand. "A perfect storm formed as the economy crashed, the crop prices plummeted, and the real estate bubble burst. The cartel seized the moment, filling the void. On one hand, they pumped money into roads and infrastructure, gave our farmers and out-of-work Smelter workers' jobs\'96\'96albeit illegal jobs. While on the other hand, they poisoned our neighbors, heck, our country with drugs. \
"So they\'92ve been here for a while, they're just more visible now with the work on the tunnel." \
The information sunk in. "Ok then. That gives me a place to start." \
"A place to start? Hold up." Aiden\'92s volume increased. "These animals cut off heads just to make a point." \
"And you work for them. If the Cartel doesn't get their stuff back\'97Ma and Bee will be the ones hanging from a bridge."\
"But Suzie\'85" \
"And even if they get their stuff back, they will kill us anyway. So, yeah, I\'92m going after them. What have I got to lose?" \
"Damn it, Suzie," Aiden tried to pull me in close. \
"It\'92s time for you to go." I pushed him away.\
"Stop. Just stop." \
I held the door open. "Leave. Now." \
"I\'92m on your side. I can help\'96\'96" I slammed the door behind him. "If you\'92ll let me." Aiden\'92s muffled voice seeped through the door. \
He wasn\'92t even down the driveway before I was back to my planning. At least now I knew who I was up against. First thing was to find out more about that land, how to get in and out, where the mine entrance was, what this casino was all about, and anything else I could use. Mrs. Jones had taken me to the County Recorder's office once. I\'92d start there. Then I\'92d venture out to the old mine and see for myself what was going on. }
