\f0\fs24 \cf0 Start with your character\'92s flaws and vulnerabilities. Ask yourself what will make them afraid or mean. What will make them strike out or run away? What would make even your nicest character hurt someone else? Where have they been hurt? How did they manage to hide or harden the wound? What happens when something rips away the protective covering of that injury?\
\
in first person from their viewpoint, as if they were writing their own diary. When beginning a character, I just write from that character\'92s viewpoint, but later when trying to understand motivation, I will give a question to write about, such as \'93Why did you kill Jake?\'94\
\
Have your character write about his/her obsession. 	\
What do your characters want more than anything? What are their dreams? What are their terrors?  \
\
Next, ask why your character\'92s friends love her/him. Try freewriting from two or three different friends\'92 points of view. Then, write a conversation between two friends about your character. This allows you to see your characters as other characters view them, both positively and negatively. I guarantee that, if you do this right, you will surprise yourself with what you will learn about your characters.\
