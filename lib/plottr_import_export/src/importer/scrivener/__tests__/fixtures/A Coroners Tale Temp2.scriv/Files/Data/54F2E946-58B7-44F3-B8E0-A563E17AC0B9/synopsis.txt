Sarah finds Edwin and asks if he will help find the burglar. Edwin hasn’t met her before, though he has seen her with Geoffrey and their daughter, HANNAH. He has thought how attractive she is, though troubled.
He says he’s very busy and it would be almost impossible
to find a burglar without a proper description, and difficult to gain a conviction without clear identification and witnesses. Sarah says she’s not bothered about a conviction, just wants back what had been stolen.
Edwin asks what it was and she refuses to say.
