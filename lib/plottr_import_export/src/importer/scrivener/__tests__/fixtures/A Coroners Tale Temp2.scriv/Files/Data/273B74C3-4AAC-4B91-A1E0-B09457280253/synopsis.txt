Edwin tells Meg he hasn't been paid yet but he's recovered the goods and will still pay Meg for his part in the finding of them. 
Meg tells Edwin he followed him to Ben Steps' house the day Steps was killed. Meg half-believes Edwin killed Ben and questions Edwin about why she had him follow Ben. Edwin tells her his whole back-story but swears he didn't kill Steps. Meg still does not believe Edwin but trusts him so tells him he'll let it go for the time being.
