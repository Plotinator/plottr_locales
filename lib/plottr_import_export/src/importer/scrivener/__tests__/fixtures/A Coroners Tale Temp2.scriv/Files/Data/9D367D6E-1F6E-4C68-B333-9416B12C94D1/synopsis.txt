SARAH Beaumont wakes in the night (her husband, GEOFFREY, is away) and hears footsteps on her stairs. As she cowers in the dark, she can tell they're receding. She does not know whether to be relieved, or concerned the person is escaping. She gets out of bed and creeps to the top of the stairs. She sees the back of a man leaving the house.
