        <Title>before chgs to Aiden's POV </Title>
        <Text>Aiden suggested it might not be safe to return home, so I sat at his mom's craft table in their garage.  Aiden, Mrs. Jones and I counted the money from my haul.  
"A little over $500,000," Mrs Jones announced. 
"Five hundred? You sure?" Aiden asked. 
"Yes, $500,000," Mrs. Jones confirmed. "Why? What's wrong?" 
"I'm not sure, but I was in the trailer when they filled that duffle for Mo to drop off at the dry cleaners.  The tally was over $750,000." 
The sound of chimes came from Aiden's pocket.  He fumbled for his phone as he mentioned for Caroline and me to be quite. . 
"Aiden here." He answer the phone.  "Understood, but my truck is acting up.  I know,  I'll have Bobby drive me." 
Mo said, "Whatever. Just get here." 
I watched Aiden clicked off the call, then dial another number. I nodded my head.  
"Bobby," Aiden said, "El Brutal's called an emergency meeting and he wants you there too.  My truck's on the firsts, pick me up on your way." 
"When?" Bobby asked. 
"Now." Aiden shook his head. 
Aidens phone pinged with a text message.  A coded message from the FBI who also insisted on  a meeting with him. 
"Looks like we've made everyone crazy," I said with a smirk. 
Aiden texted back, 'Out fishing. Catch you when I can."  
 Mrs. Jones cell rang.  Aiden said, "If they can't get me, you're up." 
"Hello?" Mrs. Jones answered her phone. 
"Meet us at the same spot where we originally met," the FBI handler stated.  I could hear him from across the table.  
"Why what's going on?" Mrs. Jones shrugged her shoulder at Aiden. 
"Be there. 30 minutes." 
Mrs. Jones phone went dead.  "Was it something I said," she smiled. 
We both laughed, but returned to dead seriousness within a beat. 
"Be careful. We're playing with fire here," Mrs. Jones said as she and Aiden walked out the door.  
Two pieces of paper sat in front of me on the table:  a letter to Ma, from years ago, and a page filled with writing made to look like the writing on the letter.  After an hour of practice, I penned the real note. 
 I tried to warn you. The dry cleaners is just the first. Return Susan and Bee XXX, to the diner by noon, [//todo/timeline - deliver Ma and Bee by noon at the diner] or your laundering sites will be washed away. Any retribution will be met with outing your stash house, and the tunnel.  [//Todo/need something earlier that is specific to David, so when referenced in the 2nd threat, they believe it's David.]
I enlisted Angel Romero to drop the note in Goldman's truck out at the mine.  He had been working there to help support his Ma and his sister after his Pa's disappearance.  He had suspected the Cartel.  His Ma didn't know a thing, thought Angel was working at the gas station's midnight shift.  Although they did need the money, Angel had really signed-on with them hoping to find his Pa, or at least find out what happened to him.  Last week, Maricela, his sister,  had followed me out of the Corner Store and begged me to stop Angel. She was terrified she'd lose him too.  
Earlier today, I offered to pay him to drop the note, then, set off the truck's alarm to ensure Gold-man would run out and find the note right away.  He flatly refused the cash.  Now, with the note in hand, he left like a man on a mission. 
I waited at the garage reviewing the paperwork I took from the safe.  The files were icing, if they were in the safe, they must have value, so I took them.  American and Mexican deeds to various properties around the state, recorded to various Limited Liability Corporations.  I jumped on Mrs. Jones' lap top, searching the Arizona Corporation Commission's site. Theses LLCs were owned by other LLCs or S Corps, and on and on.  A web of fake companies hiding something. 
Tracking the owners was useless. So I started plotting the addresses on a map I printed out of southern Arizona. After a while, a interesting pattern emerged near Jackson and across the border in Agua de vida; and another around border towns XXX and XXX [//todo/ need border towns for a second tunnel].  The Jackson cluster made sense. Looked like they were buying up land around both sides of the border.  But the XXX cluster, I could only guess what that meant. 
    The side door opened. Angel strutted in.  "It worked. Mo charged out of the motorhome as soon as his truck alarm started blaring.  He was mad," Angel laughed. "Took him a while to see the note, but after he read it, I thought he was going to have a heart attack."  
"Yeah, I bet," I smiled, visualizing Mo squirming.  "Wonder what surprised them most, that it mentioned the other stores, the stash houses, or the tunnel?" 
"El Brutal and Bobby followed Mo out.  Mo shouted at Bobby,  'You know anything about this' and you should have seen Bobby's face, he went white.  And get this," Angel took in a breath, "Bobby told Mo that David wrote it. We couldn't have planned it better."
"That's great.  I thought it would take them a while to put that together," I said mapping out the new timeline in my mind.  
"You sure stirred up a hornets nest. Are you sure about this?"  asked Angel. 
"Never more sure," I said as I gather my things. "I'll be on watch at the diner. Out of sight, but on watch.  They've gotta return them now." 
"Yeah, maybe," the concern in Angel's voice was clear.
