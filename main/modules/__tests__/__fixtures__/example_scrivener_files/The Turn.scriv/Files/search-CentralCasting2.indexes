            <Notes>This is the title page of the manuscript. Note that “Compile As-Is” is ticked - this ensures that the title page’s formatting doesn’t get changed during the Compile process, even though the formatting of other text documents will be overridden to use a standard 12-point manuscript font.

The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; tags get replaced with the information set in Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… &gt; Project Properties. You can edit those settings or just replace this text altogether.</Notes>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
Create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel. For instance, Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being’s first part is entitled “PART ONE: Lightness and Weight”. In that example, you would name the part, “Lightness and Weight” (the “Part One” will be added during Compile). You can choose not to include these titles during the Compile process.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) Some chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information. (The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; placeholders will be replaced during compile with the information you provide in the Project Properties tab of Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings…, or you can delete them and enter whatever text you like.)
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Standard Manuscript Format (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the menu button next to it (this is already selected by default).
Click “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter\Paperback Novel folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected.
Click “Compile”.

To compile to e-book format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter\E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (This does not affect the cover image.)
If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to click “Cover” in the left sidebar and select the image from the “Cover Image” menu button.
From the “Compile for” menu button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
Click “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
Part subtitles: If you don’t want to include the titles of your “Part” folders in your compiled manuscript, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” for the “Level 1” folder item. Then click on “Section Layout…” and remove the colon and space at the end of the title prefix (“Part &lt;$R&gt;”).
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” for the “Level 2+” folder item and the “Level 1” and “Level 2” text items. (Conversely, if you do want to include chapter titles for formats that don’t include them by default, tick these items.)
Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Page size: The “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking the menu button beside “Paper Size” in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings. Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are contained directly inside the “Part” folders (that is, at the same level as the current “Chapter” folders).
Move the chapter folders to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile dialog, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, select them and choose Format &gt; Formatting &gt; Preserve Formatting.
Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available in Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format (with Parts)”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” format; and “ADE E-Book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book (with Parts)” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in Adobe Digital Editions on a PC.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Na'Wra unites her world</Synopsis>
            <Text>Preface
A billion years ago
A group of fighters stand on a battlefield, bone weary, dirty, hunger their only nourishment. They can only see a few stars in the night sky through the smoke of battle. The roar of battle is over for now, the world quiet as the remaining armies of all three Houses pause in the carnage that has consumed their world.
 In a clearing, one of the fighters stands on hood of a personnel carrier. Naw’ra, a low-ranking officer in the army of the Second House, addresses a a few dozen officers from all three armies.
“Brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, we have fought this great battle for many years. One in three of us who was alive when it started has now fallen. Our air is thick with smoke, our water with blood, and our land covered with our dead, and the dead of all else that once lived here, and with poisons that will kill for years. We have fought each other for land, for wealth, for power, and we have exhausted all three in doing so.
“The three great Houses of U Maw have defeated each other and themselves in the process. I tell you that the soldiers of the Second House will fight no more. I ask the First House and the Third House to put your weapons down. They will help you no more.’
“How nice for you if we do,” shouts someone from the Third House. “I guess you want us to give you our food and children, too.””
“I want no such thing,” Naw’Ra answers, and pauses, slowing her breathing down, remembering that she has come to persuade, not to fight. “I want you to remember that before there were three Houses, there were the clans, and before the clans, there were the bands, and before that, there were just the Maw’u’I, talking animals who could not only imagine the future, but build their dreams. And in only 150,000 years, they settled all the lands and lived mostly in peace, however simple their life seems to us now. We are those same creatures, but we have lost our way. We let ourselves believe that peace and cooperation was stagnation and that only war and competition brought progress.”
“What do you want us to do?” shouts a solider from the Second House. “Tear off our clothes and live like savages?”
“Our answer is to move forward. I ask your patience for a minute, and you will begin to understand. I need only your stillness and quiet.” Naw’Ra nods, and one soldier in each of the other houses nods in return. Her two coconspirators join their minds with her and they reach out to entangle with the group around them. Despite all their doubts, they succeed. 
The soldiers gasp, feeling the connection. Now Naw’Ri speaks to them directly in their minds, her thoughts and feelings mingle with theirs. After   drowning in the fear and boredom of battle, there is something about touching the core of so many others that is deeply restorative.
“I know your heart and now you know mine. This is the first step to peace, and peace is the first step toward progress. But we need more — we need a home whose air and water doesn’t bring disease, whose land can support food. Someday, this planet will be that again, but for now, it cannot.  For years, a small group from all three houses has been working secretly on a project that will give us a new start. And now we will show you.”
All of them are still now, their minds filled with a strangely different sky, a subtley different landscape. They see a pristine world for the first time. The air tickles their nostrils, fresher than anything they have ever breathed. This new world beckons.
Soliders fall to the ground, sobbing at the joy of discovery. They look through the eyes of a few dozen souls on this new world, the first ever to leave their world. The settlers are from all three Houses. 
“Who are you?” one soldier shouts at the sky. They all feel the response.
“We are your fellow citizens, waiting for you to join us as Explorers, and as builders,” says A’mon, from the new world. “Look at the red planet just above your eastern horizon. We are there, yet we can know your thoughts and feelings, too, and you can know ours, as if we were in the same room.”
“Go home to your armies and your leaders,” Naw’Ra says. “Tell them that a new era has begun. For those who want it, I will train you to entangle so that you can demonstrate to others that this is the future we can all be part of. I have laid down my arms, and so have many others in the three armies. From this day, we are Guardians of this world. We have been fortunate to have ripped open the fabric of reality and to have seen more deeply into it than anyone before us. I have seen that there is so much power for us there that there is no need to fight over it. And now we will use that knowledge to better understand ourselves and our world.”

            <Synopsis>Raefe and Linda take the subway home to Somerville. She suggests they go to Miami. He thinks about it, agrees.
K&amp;K introduced</Synopsis>
            <Text>October, 2049

“What do you think?”
Raefe turned away from the subway window. They were underground anyway, nothing to see.
“What do I think about what?” he replied, turning toward Lina.
“About us going to Miami Sea Islands for winter break. Have you been listening at all?”
No, he thought, not at all, I was daydreaming. We were in the middle of giant firestorms, running for our lives.
“Sorry, I must have dozed off. You know how I am on the subway.”
“I do. Now that I have your attention, what do you think?”
He thought that Miami was a full day’s journey on the solar train, through some areas where the United States of America was mostly a memory. Through miles of ruined coast, and snow season coming soon.
“Maybe. I haven’t been there since the seawall broke. Wouldn’t it be depressing?”
“I hear it’s actually cool – you can swim along all these old hotels, all kinds of fish come in and out. It’s like those coral reefs you see in old movies from the vstream archives.”
“I don’t know, let me think about it.”
Lina was used to his indecision. “You’re having those dreams again? Just when you dozed off now?”
“Yeah. Surprised me. Usually only happens after I’ve been asleep for a while.”
She began the “shouldn’t you get some help for it” conversation for the nth time and he forced himself to smile and look away. He had never told her about the hours of therapy, the drugs, the electrostimulation, all the rest that his parents had dragged him to in his adolescence. 
Fortunately, his parents didn’t like coming to East Somerville — they had grown up in sketchy neighborhoods and didn’t like to be reminded. Out of site, they couldn’t exercise their irrational belief in the power of psychopharmaconeurology on him from afar. PPN could get out of control and he tried hard to avoid it. He knew they were just dreams, even if they were frightening and often ruined his ability to sleep. They came and went, and when they went, he got all the sleep he could.
The train glided to a stop in TechTown, with it’s 40-story glass towers towering over  Cambridge. Several heads jerked upright, their Voices telling them through their fashionably invisibly tiny ear implants that it was time to wake the frick up and get off the sooty train and head home to their fancy little condos. Shiny little office nerds, nervously tapping their eyeglass puters on. Must check those messages, wouldn’t want to have to look at all the grimey losers on the train.
Some of his friends longed to work in TechTown after graduation. Not for Raefe. Sleep on the 11th floor, work on the 17th floor, exercise in the basement, parties on the roof, you were basically a well-kept serf. Your company crashes, not only do you loose your job, you have to move. All for the promise of “earning a spot among the best and brightest.” Or at least the most impressed with themselves. No thanks, there had to be a life that was better than that. If only he knew what it was.
Finally, they reached Union Square. Kiko and Kayam's Deli trike was out  and Lina won’t walk by without stopping for Kayam’s Cairo Cubano. Plus, K&amp;K are human message boards for many of the fugees that flow in and through Somerville.
“What’s shaking, Lina,” Kayam said. “What you hear from East Africa?”
“As little as possible, Kayam,” she replied. “I’ve got all the memories I can stand from that place.”
“I hear you, girl. I haven’t heard from my cousin in a while, though, and I’m  getting worried.”
“Well, it ain’t getting better. Last time I faced with my folks on the net, they said word in South Africa is the pirate gangs are banding together and giving the Chinese big trouble.”
“If I know my cousin, he’s in the middle of that.” Kayam shakes his head as if his cousin was already in jail or worse. “That’s the thing in Efricar — you either be a stooge for the Chinese or fall in with the local crazies. Seems like that’s the only choice they get.”
“Well, if he can get himself down to Sofricar, maybe my folks can hook him up,” Lina says, but she knows his cousin is from a little village and barely even knows where Sofricar is.
Neither Kim nor Raefe has ever been to Efricar, but Kiko knows the whole fugee diaspora scene all too well. Her family fled Yokohama after Emperor Kim VI sent hundreds of drones filled with radioactive waste all over the city. Many hit ships in the harbor filled with export goods, which cratered the economy. There was no welcome for her family elsewhere in Japan, so here she is in East Somerville. Raefe’s the odd man out. Six generations ago, his family was like hers, refugees from Czarist Russia and all its pogroms and unrest. But they’ve lived within 150 miles of here for six generations.
“Stay warm!” Raefe said. They walked down toward the old highway, his arm around Lina, her ‘froish hair scratching his nose. He inhaled the scent of her skin mixed with coffee and dark sugar. She could be fierce, but he felt like they had each put tendrils out toward each other in the last year, and they had begun to mesh. It was a new feeling and he liked it.
The last rays of the sun glint off the harbor, just pass their little overpass. In ‘41, the big Arctic ice sheet disaster that sent tidal waves into Miami also pushed the Mystic River far into East Somerville. The waters stopped about 50 yards from a small section of elevated highway that was underwater except for this section.
“Seeing that sunset past the bridge always reminds me of when we met,” Raefe said.
“Did we meet?” she  shot back. “I seem to remember I was just standing over there and you were busy looking at my ass.”
He blushed. “You’re not going to let me forget that. I wasn’t actually looking at your ass, anyway.”
They’d been working all day on project to reclaim the neighborhood after the flood, and Raefe was exhausted. He was trying to push a cart overloaded with building materials, but it was rough going across the cracked terrain of the broken asphalt. Before he knew it, Lina had leaned in to the front handle of the cart. As she pushed her shirt rode up a bit and he could see the muscles ripple in the small of her back, and she just seemed to be bursting with life.
“Uh huh,” she smiled. “Anyway, I almost fell out laughing when I turned around. You had that look guys get when they check out girls and get caught. Like you thought you had one more second to cross the street before the train hit you and you just realized that big light in front of the train was shining right on you.”
He remembered her chuckling more than laughing, and he was more awestruck than embarrassed. The next day they wound up working together on the project, and when it was finished three months later, they’d already coupled up. So when Somerville gave preference to the reclaim workers for some of the housing units, they put in for the lottery and here they were, unlocking their own Tiny under the old overpass.
Raefe remembered their conversation on the train.  “Do we have enough carbon credits to go to Miami without paying a fine?”
“Yes! And if we spend one day helping to build the tidal power generation station, we can not only get some of them back, but get a free place to crash for the week.”
And no ‘puters to consume the day studying recent ancient history. And maybe he and Lina could use some time alone.
He agreed, and Lina was happy. Doing well enough to muddle through Somerville Community College and keep Lina in his life were about the only two things he could focus on at one time. Maybe some fun time would calm him. </Text>

            <Synopsis>Diver introduced. Raefe is switched to a different time line.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Diver disentangled from the stream. She had stayed connected to Raefe almost to the end, watching as he and Lina clung to a shard of the power dam, battered by the relentless ocean, terrified, waiting for death. It never stopped being impossible, watching the strivings of conscious beings in these terrible moments, but she felt it was not possible to be a Guardian without doing it. 
Now she focused her mind back to the Guardian waveform, she could feel the others  going through the same emotions. She had to calm herself and concentrate on the future. Raef had less than a half hour left. In the corner of her mind that tended to such things, she asked the room to make the walls soothing. They showed a blue green gradient that evoked the sky meeting a forest. She let her mind clear the fear she had felt through Raefe.
“He is strongly entangled, this Raefe. Even near the end, I have rarely felt someone unenhanced as he is so sensitive to the wave function.”
“It is true,” Far Flier felt, sending her a wash of sympathy. He knew her role as primary contact was draining. “If only more of his kind were as in tune.”
“I sense many are, more than they know. I still believe there is a backbone in this race that may yet overcome the usual obstacles,” she let him know. “After all, they were trying to undo the damage they had done, and not even for personal gain.”
But she could feel a hard strain in the waveform. Some of the Guardians were unconvinced about this place called Earth, these beings called People. She sensed their impatience and wondered why.
“You the People as being on the edge of transition to something better,” Hanikori answered. “But I see a very small number of People who fit that description and many more who contribute to their own destruction.”
“You haven’t felt their emotions, you don’t understand how their minds work,” Diver answered. “They are passionate, they love life. They have not learned how to read their own emotions, but we have guarded many less promising species, and many of them  crossed the threshold past destruction.”
“The simulations back Diver up,” Far Flier said. “This Raefe, he can be someone who heals and leads his own species down a better path. But we must act. He doesn’t yet know that the there has been a catastrophic slide of the largest remaining Antartic ice sheet, and that all the oceans will reach equilibrium at 45 feet higher than they were 100 years ago. With all of his promise, he will not be able to effect change with such vast destruction to the coastal areas of this world.”
“This is just what I mean,” Hanikori said. “You want us to continue with a world where we only have one contact, who is himself very immature, and is sitting on an artifical rock on a ravaged world where a billion people are going to die in the next year.”
“In this timeline, yes, Hanikori,” Far Flier answered. “But there are many kinder time lines. I have already entangled him with one. Per the usual protocol, he will wake up in a new timeline, unaware of this mass extinction and his own impending death. The simulations suggest that we will have most, maybe all, of his remaining life, to work with.”
“I strongly object, Far Flier,” Hanikori replied. “You have no right to waste our resources on pet projects with no hope of success.”
“Enough!” Far Flier’s thoughts had become cold and hard. “It is exactly my role to make such a decision. And I cannot fathom why you would object. We know from experience that a species whose time lines vary over so many outcomes is promising.  Many alternate possibilities mean there are many ways for them to succeed, not just many ways to fail. Diver, you will have some more time to nudge these People away from their precipice.”
She smiled. Such an old word – precipice – harkening back to when the Guardians had not yet left their cliff dwellings, to before they had actually been Guardians, millennia ago when unknown to themselves, other Guardians had shepherded them past the threshold. For an instant, her mind felt her fingers gripping the table they were sitting around, the raw pressure of it pushing aside the warm bath of the wave function her mind lived. She gave herself these little nano-moments – she had to if she was going to entangle with non-enhanced beings like Raefe. She understood that Far Flier was making her see that Raefe would be terrified, even as he emerged in the new time line, like a man peering out of cave that used to open on flat ground, and now looked out only at a drop off of thousands of feet. She had work to do.
She shifted her attention back to the wormhole interface network, to the node that captured the entangled stream that gathered Earth’s information matrix. One of her enhancements combed the stream of wave functions until she found Raefe’s. He was asleep, thankfully, the exhaustion of catastrophe plunging him into a deep but troubled sleep.
He would awake as if none of that happened, in a world where none of it yet had. It would be the same morning he had awakened only hours before. He would not know nor would he be likely to understand that he was now in a different time line. There would be tiny differences from his old world that might puzzle him, but his species had many moments like that – without enhancement, they were subject to imperfect memories and were easily suggestible.
She found the dream in his mind. He was on the mound of appliances, searching frantically for Lina. If he didn’t find her, he would awake in a panic, his mind still retaining the memories of the very real flood that had happened in his old timeline. They would be imprinted in parts of his mind he wasn’t even aware of, nor could he access them. These panics would return, and seem quite real, and might eventually push him over his own precipice, into madness. Until then, he would waste more time trying to undo his dreaming, listening to Demo. The AI was no more than a blind machine – and a very primitive one at that – as effective as trying to understand a riot of color by measuring wavelengths. The AI could not help him now. She wanted him to feel his potential to connect, to heal.
She found his feelings about Lina and merged them with his dream. Now he turned and she presented herself to him as Lina. She imagined being Lina, and the energy of that flowed through the wormhole and entangled with his thoughts.
In the dream, he smiled at her. She smiled back, and said, “You saved us. We were all goners.”
“But it’s all gone,” he said. “It’’s all water.”
“You can make it fresh water,” she said. “It will sink into the ground and everything will grow back. Kiss me and you will see how to do it.””
He did. That was the first thing he remembered from the dream when he woke up.</Text>

We get a sense of how the world is organized.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The next day
Raefe woke with a start. Lina was still asleep next to him. He had been dreaming something, he couldn't quite remember, just that Lina had kissed him on the ear right before he woke up.
It was just after 6AM, but he wasn't sleepy. Usually, he hated the last day of a vacation, but he felt strangely animated this morning. That might not be such a good thing, considering they would be on the solar train for 8 hours today. There were faster ways to go than a 250 mph train, but they all involved many more carbon credits than a student could afford.
The little room coffee maker did its thing and he took his cup out on to the balcony. It was a fine January morning. The beach on their little island was nearly empty this early, just a few joggers and dog walkers beating the heat. Small clouds of tiny baitfish erupted here and there as the barracuda chased them. The pelicans watched the barracuda patiently, knowing the sun would warm deeper waters that held more interest to the fish, leaving the shallows to the pelicans.
The tidal waves in '41 had drowned thousands of people. All the blood had drawn huge schools of every predator fish in the south Atlantic. Urban legend had it that the flood had washed tons of Cokke and Wyn into the water from the drug lord neighborhoods, sending the fish into such a frenzy that they never found their way back to their original feeding grounds.
It is just a big ball of water, isn't it, he thought. Billions of years of stuff floating around, reaching for the sun, eating and being eaten, and us just living at the edges, so full of ourselves. He had read about a group of scientists who had taught chimps how to take apart complex machines like motors or 3D printers. They had done something to their brains, and given them some kind of drugs, and it was enough so that the chimps could perform chains of complicated tasks. The scientists had practically given themselves a Musk Prize, they were so impressed with this &quot;synthetic guided evolution.&quot;
The problem was, the chimps couldn't put the machines back together. That was a whole different kind of thinking. 
He realized Lina was standing in the door, watching him.
&quot;Hey, whatcha thinking?&quot;
&quot;Hey. Just watching the 'cudas having breakfast and realizing they used to live hundreds of miles south of here. And thinking, shit, we're just great at breaking things apart, aren't we? And not so great at putting them back together.&quot;
&quot;Wow, where did that come from?&quot;
&quot;You, actually. I had a dream, and you said something about fixing the world.&quot;
&quot;What did I say?&quot;
&quot;That's the problem,&quot; Raefe said. &quot;I can't quite remember. But it was a good dream.&quot;
&quot;Shit, now we're really in trouble. I don't know how to fix the world either. Well, here's to dreams!&quot;
She smiled and downed her coffee. The great mass of her tiger-striped hair had apparently gone anarchist during the night. Yellow and brown strands went every which way, as if her cinnamon skin had separated itself into her mother's East African brown and her father's golden Chinese shades, and flowed like a braided river out into her hair, to be lit up by the morning sun. His gaze lasted a tad too long, causing her to run her finger nervously along the ropey scar tissue that capped her right ear, a reminder of the East African holocaust she could never quite ignore. He reached up and stilled her hand, letting his fingers travel over her scar and into her tangled hair.
&quot;Here's to dreams!&quot; he mumbled, feeling awkward despite his best intentions. She answered with a long kiss.
&quot;Hmm, that was nice,&quot; Lina said. &quot;But dreamy boy, we have a train to catch. Back to reality.&quot;
 They had a quiet breakfast, and packed up their stuff.
Two hours later, they were on a half-empty train. 
&quot;I hope this wasn't a mistake,&quot; Lina said. &quot;Rolling the dice on taking this train.&quot;
Most people avoided the northbound trip in January, not knowing if the snow monsoons would come a little early or hold off until February.  If they caught you on the train, the snow could last for weeks, the train might exhaust its solar batteries and you'd freeze to death. 
&quot;I'm not worried, We'll be back in our little hole in the wall  in East Somerville by the time the snows arrive. This is the perfect time for a cheap trip -- it's cool outside, so we don't have to pay for AC, either.&quot;
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Lina said. &quot;Just looks like everyone on the train is a student or a migrant worker -- no one who had a choice.&quot;
The train headed out of Miami and soon the flat marshes of east Florida were rolling by like an endless video loop, long-legged white birds picking small fish out of the swamps under orange trees long mummified by the salty tidal flow. Raefe turned from the window and noticed a small wirey man was now sitting across the aisle. He looked about 30, and was wearing worn out old military shorts and a Brasil Futbol shirt. 
&quot;Where you headed?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Up between Hilton Head and Charleston,&quot; the man said, Eelton Ed and Sharlston in his vaguely Braz accent.
&quot;What's there?&quot; Raefe wondered. No one went there since the '41 floods had swept over it.
&quot;Salvage.&quot;
&quot;Wow, I would have thought nine years after the floods, there wouldn't me much left.&quot;
&quot;Nothing left from the floods but salt marsh.  I'm a 'cane harvester.&quot;
Raefe was confused. &quot;Sugar cane?&quot;
&quot;No, hurricanes. I follow them up the coast from Brazil from September on. The 'canes wash up tons of stuff – fishing boats, plastic, parts of old shipping containers –– and nobody even knows it's there. All the way up, the places like Hilton Head that were hit in '41 -- no one lives there anymore for miles around. The corpos pay off the big merc companies for sat images, and when they spot big accumulations, they put out word to the 'cane harvester combines. They call me and I salvage it.&quot;
&quot;Wow, you can make a living on that?&quot;
&quot;Sort of. The corpos pay me to catalog the stuff. I put the catalogs on the 'net – 2 tons of usable wood, 1 ton of weldable steel, that kind of thing. Then the corpos have some kind of auction and it gets sold and someone comes and gets it. I get a fee for that end, too. It don't add up to that much, but I also get carbs from some governments and from the Western Hemisphere Restoration Fund, too.&quot;
&quot;Cool. Carbs are good things to have.&quot;
&quot;Most places, better than money. Maybe they'll get the whole warming thing turned around, and I'll be out of luck. But I'll believe that when I see it. I been doing this for 8 years, and carbs are worth more every year.&quot;
&quot;Till they ain't,&quot; Lina said. &quot;You know they're playing you, right?&quot;
&quot;Everybody's playing everybody, near's I can tell,&quot; the drifter responded, trying to size up Lina. &quot;But what do you mean, 'till they ain't'?&quot;
&quot;Where I grew up -- East African Republic --  was full of people like you, drifters,&quot; Lina said. &quot;People whose grandparents had come from the interior, little farm villages, to the cities, who had never really found steady work. They were salvagers, day laborers, any kind of work. Chinese paid them in carbs, too. Didn't work out too great -- sure, they had a lot of carbs, but they had to spend them local or exchange the for the local plastic trash currency. They had some complicated-ass scheme for exchanging carbs, and you know how that shit always works out.&quot;
&quot;Right, they win, you lose,&quot; the drifter agreed. &quot;But so far, the corpos are busy enough making mondo money on trash that my cut don't matter to them. But I can believe it. These corpos, any way they can screw you they will. But I don't stay long enough in one place to spend all my money anyway. And I don't work for one outfit, either.&quot;
&quot;Least as far as you know,&quot; Lina said, unconvinced. &quot;You know money, it all flows one way.&quot;
&quot;Authentic -- away from us,&quot; the drifter laughed. &quot;You pretty smart for a kid.&quot;
&quot;No kids in Efricar,&quot; Lina said. &quot;Just little people trying to live long enough to get big. How's the work, though -- is it OK?&quot;
&quot;It's tough, but I've done worse. They got a camp up there you live in. This place, you have to get around in a kayak – they don't want to spend carbs on motor boats. You paddle around all day, putting 'net tags on stuff and photoing it. You gotta hike through mud and muck for a lot of it. And there's always snakes and bugs.&quot;
&quot;Maybe not my thing,&quot; Raefe answered. &quot;I try to avoid snakes.&quot;
&quot;Would if I could. But a snake every once in a while is worth it to me. No Voice out there, can't wear one of those little eyeball puters either. They don't trust us not to make side deals, and besides, we have to dive a bit sometimes and they ain't gonna spring for underwater puters and all that gear. So no data bots tracking my every move, counting my every second of work, no AI reminding me that I'm 17% behind the baseline productivity rate of my fellow workers. I tried office work in Brazil – not for me.&quot;
&quot;Doesn't it get lonely?&quot; Raefe wondered.
&quot;Too busy to worry about it during the day, and the camps are OK at night. One thing, we always got fresh fish for dinner. Lot of 'cane harvesters are Carib, they always got a jam going on. I teach 'em a little supersamba, it's all good. The company looks the other way what we smoke, how we sleep. This is the end of the season though, my last gig until after the hurricanes start up again.&quot;
He turned his head toward the window, as if to say, conversation over. A few minutes later, he was snoring. 
That was about as much as Raefe had ever heard Lina talk about life in Efricar. 
&quot;So, is that how your dad got to Africa -- Chinese corpos?&quot;
&quot;Not exactly. The Chinese government  went first. The rounded up all the drifters, and the ones that had drifted further from being respectable citizens into piracy or kidnapping. Nothing was working down there -- no farming, no factories, no tourists, no rain, no luck. People did anything they could to get money. The Chinese announced they were all terrorists, shot a few thousand of them, and then signed the rest up to do all the dangerous bits of building their ports and fish farms, and mines.&quot;
&quot;Your dad was an engineer, though, right?&quot; Raefe said.
&quot;Yeah, he worked for the Coastal Friendship Alliance, fancy name for 'we buy the shovels, you dig us a port so our big ships can take everything we pay you next to nothing to make.' But he messed up – he fell in love with my brown mother. At that time, the New Kingdom Party was running China, only the golden need apply. They had no problem with a little chocolate sauce on the side, but no diluting the genes.  So their wedding present to him was a reassignment from head engineer to work crew boss on a massive swamp-clearing project. That's like being the warden of a lunar penal colony. You got a nicer bed than the inmates, but otherwise, you're just as fucked.&quot;
&quot;Is that why your folks left?&quot;
&quot;That's a long story. Basically, the carb economy tanked and that set off a chain reaction when people found out their money was worthless. Riots led to repression, repression led to civil war, civil war led to the bombings and the holocaust. At some point, my dad had to choose a side, and he took me and my mom and we fled to Sofricar when I was 10. I can't remember all that much.&quot;
Or don't want to, he thought. He wanted to ask her about the scar, but bit his tongue. Best thing with Lina was to wait until she ready. She'd just put her suit of armor on otherwise.

            <Text>Chapter &lt;$n&gt;

Raefe stared out of the window at the snow, falling for the third straight day. The morning blizzard had eased up to a light fall as the backside of the storm circled through. They’d get a few hours of sun now before the ‘soon swirled back fresh with frozen moisture from the ocean.
He thought of the snow crew on the train ride, probably exhausted after the last three weeks of this, lying alongside a road somewhere, trying to catch a little nap before the next storm wave hit. They’d work almost around the clock for the snow ‘soon season, piling up as much money as they could. Then they’d head on to the next migrant jobs they could find. What a life!
He read a class assignment with no particular enthusiasm. He remembered a character in an old vid saying “I’m putting this town in my rear view,” and that’’s what where his classes seemed focused on. It was interesting, in an abstract sort of way. But everything was different now, and would be different tomorrow. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if the people of the past had that much to offer, why was he living through mass extinctions, endless wars around the world, corpos corrupting every government to their own ends, and the possibility of total disaster looming?
But if he flunked out of Human Potential 221, he’d be in danger of losing his scholarship. And if he lost that, he’d be out on the street, and then he’d become a snow monkey or something equally undesirable. There was always something worse, he was discovering.
He turned back to his screen, trying to focus on this rather abstruse lecture on “Cooperation versus competition in pre-electronic societies.” He listened for the third time, trying to understand what was really different about back then, trying to picture a world where you mostly had to be face to face with people to see what they really looked like and sounded like. Was there any type of person on earth he had not seen or heard on the ‘net? He tried to imagine different variables – tallest, shortest, fattest, thinnest, palest, darkest, hair, eyes –– what a motley bunch we all were. He turned up the Carnival music coming out of Rio on the Net and closed his eyes and tried to picture them. 
There was a long line of odd looking people, sambaing toward him. He danced down the line, shaking each person’s hand, asking their name and where they were from. Olaf, the Viking pirate, Norumbega, dives for pearls, on down the line he went until he came to a woman who looked nothing like anyone he had ever met.
She was more than 2 meters tall, but there was something about the way her shoulders, hips and feet formed a long, sinuous arce that was as striking as her height. At first she looked white, but then he realized she had a faint violet glow about her, as if lit from within. She had long black hair, but it too had a faint purplish tinge. And her eyes could only be called fuchsia.
“Who are you,” he asked her.
“I’m Diver. I’m glad we are finally getting to meet, Raefe.”
“How do you know my name?”
“I became interested in you some time ago, and I’ve been learning about you.”
“What? Why would be watching me?”
“I’m going to tell you that. Let’s go sit over here.” She waved toward a small grove, with a little curved bench big enough for the both of them. There was a slight breeze that kept the trees tilting this way and that in a quiet rustle. Overhead, the sky was blue with tufty cotton clouds. The Carnival music had disappeared.
She sat across from him and laid her hands on top of his. They seemed weightless yet warm. She closed her eyes and without thinking, so did he.
A second went by and then he felt a sensation that he had never felt before, as if the two of them were passing by each other, no more like through each other, as if they each were a school of fish swimming at right angles to each other without touching. Startled, he opened his eyes. She was smiling at him.
“There, now we are more firmly linked,” she said.
“Linked to what?”
“To each other.”
He looked down. She wasn’t touching him anymore but he still had that feeling.
“You have many questions and some of the answers will be hard for you to understand or believe. So let me start with the biggest news. My name is Diver, as I said, but I am not human. Nor am I actually here. I live on a planet my kind call A’Nonto – it means Red Flower in your language –– around a star more than 20 light years from you.”
“And you’ve travelled here to see me? Why”
“No, I have not travelled to your world. It would take many lifetimes to travel to your world. But like many other intelligent species, after thousands of years of watching the stars and trying to understand the universe, we have found ways to send signals vast distances through shortcuts in the universe. I believe in your culture, these are called wormholes. Unlike some of your more imaginative entertainment, living things, nor any other objects of any size, cannot go through wormholes. But energy – information --  can.”
“So, you’re just some kind of holo vid?”
“Not exactly. Perhaps you will take a course in your school that goes deeper into physics and it will become easier for you to understand. But the basic idea is that when the big bang happened, what was once a mass of energy, all interacting in a single waveform, flew outward and cooled and separated into the universe we see. But subtle connections remain between matter that once was connected, subtle pathways for waves to form. Your physicists call this quantum entanglement, although they are far from understanding how it works. We have learned how to travel those pathways and strengthen them, even across wormholes. So right now, my brain and your brain are having a conversation over these many light years because we are entangled with each other.”
“How did this happen? Did someone plant a chip in me?”
She smiled. “No, you have a great gift. All living things sense entanglement to some degree – we all have atoms and even smaller particles that condensed out of the primordial bang and this creates a very low level field that we mostly aren’t aware of. You and I, and many, many others, are creatures who somehow concentrate this entanglement more than our fellow beings. We are not sure why or how. But we know it’s true and have been meeting living creatures throughout the galaxy this way for thousands of years. And before us, for more than a billion years, other creatures have been doing the same.”
“I don’t know what to say. I don’t feel particularly special. I’m just a kid who gets headaches, sometimes daydreams too much, and is struggling to get through college. Sometimes I feel like I want to do something big, but I don’t think even I believe that I will, and I know no one else does. I’m one of those people other people say ‘‘nice guy, not too ambitious, a little dreamy’ about.”
“Your headaches and daydreams are a symptom of your gift, and of your inability to channel it. I will help you with that in time. As for the rest, I think you are going to do big things.”
Raefe felt like a guitar string that had been plucked and couldn’t stop vibrating. Her words were like a song playing in his head. Did she feel his thoughts in the same way?
“Yes, that’s exactly it,” she smiled. “I do feel your thoughts that way. In time, it will seem unremarkable to you and you will begin to notice that from other people in your world, too.”
“Maybe I have already. Sometimes I meet someone and I have this vague sense of a kind of static electricity between us.”
“Excellent! You are on your way.”
“To what?”
“Now I have to tell you some hard things, and ask your help.”
For the first time, he felt fear. He looked around. They were in this little woods, all alone. There were no buildings on the horizon. Where was he? Could he leave if he wanted?
“You can relax, Raefe. You are asleep. When you wake up, you will remember this, and you will be free to do whatever you want. For now, let me explain some things. Is that OK?”
“Yes, I want to hear what you have to say. Or think, or whatever it is we are doing.”
“Your scientists have made great strides in the last few generations and found many planets outside your star system, including some that they think might have life. Including, actually, my planet, but that’s a story for another day. My species discovered these things about 10,000 years ago and for many generations, we made plans to roam the galaxy to look for intelligent life. But ultimately, we realized that this is unlikely in the ordinary way. The galaxy, let alone the universe, is vast and empty. There is life everywhere, including intelligent life, but the distances are too great. Ultimately, we learned that living things have been trying for more than 3 billion years to bridge these distances.
“Like you, we had many forms of speculation about traveling faster than light, and making instant trips to other civilizations. Alas, after 3 billion years, no living things have solved that puzzle. But, like others before us, we learned more about the quantum world and learned to exploit certain phenomenon, to be able to send energy through wormholes. And then we learned to organize that energy in certain ways so that we could have useful communications with other lifeforms.
“What we discovered is that there is a loose association of advanced lifeforms called Guardians who speak to each other across these wormhole links. While life is plentiful, even intelligent life, it is sparse. And frail. Many intelligent species destroy themselves, many others are destroyed by random events, like the comet that helped destroy the dinosaurs on your world. They, by the way, might have become as intelligent as your species, so you see how it goes.
“So I am a Guardian, and I am working to nurse your species through its most dangerous epoch. You see it all around you – your species has developed great destructive power. You could wipe yourself out in a day with nuclear weapons. Right now, you are wiping yourselves out with a slower destruction of your environment. You have learned a great deal about the natural world, and can manipulate it for both productive and destructive purposes. Yet you know very little, yet, about yourselves. About how your own minds work, and how to steer them to avoid these calamities.”
“Wow, you can say that again. That’s all we seem to do – mess things up and then talk about why and how. But we never seem to change much. What can we do?””
“I can’t tell you that. Both because I don’t know – every species must find its own way – and because Guardians have discovered the hard way that accelerating your development through giving you extensive knowledge of discoveries you are millennia from reaching on your own never works. Ultimately, your knowledge of yourselves and the physical universe must develop in a new way, in a more linked way,  that you will have to find on your own.””
“And you want me to do that? Are you kidding? I never got past the basics in science. I’m more of a poet than a physicist.”
She smiled. “No, Raefe, the future of humanity is not your responsibility alone. But you already feel that you want to do something with your life, you want to find new answers, maybe even new questions. I know you have shared these thoughts with your mate, and so they must be important to you?”
“Yes, I have thought about those things. Lina and I have had some very odd experiences lately, and we met some interesting people. But I really have no plan.”
“One of those people you met was Alton Winchester. Like you, he is an entangler – I think you sensed that.”
“I did! It was weird. You know about our train trip?”
“Yes.”
“Him and that ridiculous Jefferson Davis character. I felt it from both of them.”
She considered that for a second. “I have not felt Davis. I will give that some thought. Winchester, he is not far enough along as you to contact. But he is doing good things. You should follow your instincts and meet him and talk. There are others – you will learn better to identify them, and I will also point some out to you.”
“Seems kind of creepy, like I’m putting together some kind of sleeper cell for aliens.”
“You will have to judge our motives and actions for yourself. But my goals isn’t to have you carry out some plot. These people who are entanglers, they connect with other People in different ways. They sense different parts of what ultimately will be a solution for your species. My only goal is to connect you with each other, so that you can begin that work yourself.
“Right now, there is some urgency. Your species has a good chance of self-destruction in your lifetime. Change is not simple in your world.”
“Well, I was going to visit Alton anyway, so no worries there. Can I tell him about you?”
“I would advise against it. I think you understand on a very basic level that if you discuss this with others, the issue will become your sanity, not the substance of what it is to be done. For others, the narrative will come too close to religion, and they will become passive, thinking that the Guardians will save them as some kind of gods. In billions of years, intelligent life has never found gods. If they exist, they hide well. Although we also still cannot explain some aspects of how the universe works, gods have little to do in our worldview. So you should probably think of me as a muse, a source of inspiration, that you meet in dreams.”
“Ah, so this is a dream?”
“Yes, for now, that is how we will meet. But you will remember all of it. And now, I will show you how to deal with those headaches.”
He felt a warmth, as if a tiny river of honey was flowing from one part of his head (or was it just his mind) to another. He understood that he could turn that flow on next time he felt that migraine-like headache, and it would soothe it. He smiled. This was going to be alright.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Diver informs the Guardians of Raefe's progress.
Far Flier visits Diver. They mate.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The focus shifted to Diver. She felt the overlapping waves of the committee, the patterns of interest, skepticism, affection, hostility. She let her report flow calmly.
&quot;Ordinarily, I would have told you about the steady progress we’ve made with the People. You all know that we had shifted a promising receptee, Raefe, into a new timeline to prolong his development. But unexpected events have just recently taken place that put the whole situation into a different phase.”
She gave them her memories of some of her discussions with Raefe.
“So he is near death?” Hanikori asked.
“Fortunately, no. He was, in fact, able to contact another promising candidate, Alton Winchester. He’s not as far along, and so all Raefe could do was get Alton’s mind thinking about the situation, and Alton took it from there. He organized a rescue and got medical care for Raefe.”
“Will he return to normal?” Green asked.
Diver smiled. “He will return to better than normal. I’ve received an extensive analysis from our medical programs. I won’t bore you with the details of human physiology, but the conflict triggered an intense burst of hormones that  initiated a series of subtle transformations. In short, Raefe’s ability to entangle has increased by an order of magnitude.”
“Well, we are glad your charge has not died on you,” Hanikori said. “But I think this shows that despite your best efforts, these People can do nothing but harm themselves and each other.”
“You are quick to judge,” Far Flier said. “Let her finish her report.”
 “You are right, Hanikori,” Diver said. “Human society is what you say. It is a long time since you were an ambassador like me. I fear you have forgotten that every society stuck on the brink of self destruction is like them. Including the ones that ultimately cross that threshold and never look back.”
“Yes, yes, that is always your answer,” Hanikori said. “We did it, others will follow. What evidence do you have?”
“Evidence? How legalistic of you,” Diver said. “Perhaps do remember well ancient societies, with their endless litigous debates that never seem to care about the truth. I am only giving a report, not evidence. But I will report this: The first thing he did with his new powers was reach and spontaneously entangle with his mate, attempting to heal her wounded psyche.”
This was what they Guarded for, these moments of hope that they could build on. But she could feel unconvinced opposition in their wave function.
&quot;Since your intervention, this one has made strides,” Hanikori conceded. “But he is one of 9 billion. And he has taken baby steps and very slow ones at that.” 
&quot;It seems slower to us than it does to him,&quot; Diver replied, acknowledging while contradicting. &quot;The more I entangle with them, the more I see the imbalance between their rational and emotional lives, and the consequent slowness with which they come to grasp new ways.&quot;
&quot;Precisely. And yet they are near the brink again, in his new world. Which makes me wonder why we continue with this Earth,&quot; said Green. Diver was not surprised. He and Hanikori had long been impatient with what they saw as lost causes.
&quot;But they are making progress,&quot; she insisted. &quot;We have seen this before. About 10 of their generations ago, their urbanization process threatened to kill them off in waves of disease. They had no understanding of their own biology. Their medicine was based either on superstition or trial and error. Yet within three generations, they solved the riddle of bacteria, the major threat to them, and have ever since been gradually spreading new practices throughout their societies. And we have other examples. This species seems to work fastest when time is shortest.&quot;
&quot;I don't see it that way,&quot; Hanikori replied. &quot;They are a classic case of a society stuck in the Optimization phase. They have learned much about the physical world, and most of them are in love with the notion that there is a physical answer to every problem. The only significant agents of progress in their society favor more technology, their opponents less or just different technology. At the same time, many of them still engage in magical thinking, refusing to face facts.&quot;
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Green said. &quot;They have made little progress in understanding their own inner workings and how their minds interact with these changes they are constantly implementing. And what progress they have made seems entirely focused on each individual. From your reports, I see no evidence that they have come to understand in any deep way how their individual natures, small group natures, big group behavior, and species behavior interact. They constantly replicate mistakes of the past, each time with more optimized technology. We know this is the path to self-destruction.&quot;
&quot;Yes, we do,&quot; Diver agreed. &quot;If it were not true, we would have no mission there. But now we have a catalyst in Raefe, and a other promising individuals who are only slightly behind him, who are beginning to break through to a new paradigm. We have succeeded with such allies before with other species, many times. The simulations still allow for a reasonable chance of success.  I ask only for patience.&quot;
&quot;You ask for more,&quot; Green responded instantly, as if waiting to pounce. &quot;You ask for energy to maintain the entanglement, indeed for more and more to spread it. You ask for more Guardians.&quot;
&quot;I ask what all Guardians have always asked for,&quot; she replied. &quot;That we spend our time and energy as needed to save life and nurture it to sustainability. What better use do we have for our time and energy?&quot;
She was puzzled. Once again she had felt the hard edge of judgment from Hanikori's cohort. They often came dangerously close to talking about &quot;worthy&quot; species, an idea she thought the very opposite of what being a Guardian was. It was an old idea that plagued many advanced species, who found it hard to resist looking at intelligent life that was millennia behind them in development as pets, or worse, garden plants, to be tended until they became boring, or worse still, pests to be eliminated. Shedding that notion was one of the key steps to becoming a Guardian species, but it was never shed all at once, or for all time.
But Green's bunch had never made an argument based on resources. Why now? Her effort with the People was one of thousands underway by hundreds of Guardians, each of which consumed a relatively small part of the energy they were able to extract from the vacuum. Why pick on her or her project?
Even as she pondered this, she could feel a shift in the wave function.  Far Flier, always encouraging her, now felt stern. But she could feel Green shrink, too, from him.
&quot;We are not here to debate whether we are Guardians,&quot; Far Flier said flatly. &quot;We are only ambassadors, and we must carry out the will of all of our kind to be Guardians. Green, Hanikori, you are free to raise the wisdom of guardianship with the Whole. In the meantime, our choices with any species we are Guarding are limited to how we may help them, not whether. And now I think there are others who have news to report, as well.&quot;

            <Synopsis>Putonomo reveals his science project. Hanikori sets Green to watch Diver.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Hanikori has picked the location with great care. On the slopes of Anonto’s only active volcano, there is an ancient lava tube. Deep at the bottom, there is boiling lava that sends hot air out of a vent at the top. But there is also small chute that leads to it, whose entrance is hidden by rocks that block its view, but still leave room to enter. The shape of the tube prevents too much heat from entering it. But the entire area is filled with masses of swirling ions generated by the lava below. There is so much quantum activity that most Guardians could never penetrate the static to entangle with him, let alone an ordinary A’Moptan. 
Hanikori, on the other hand, has made a study of quantum noise and has perfected his own filtering techniques. So the cave is safe from prying minds. Still, he trusts no one.
“Green, prepare a quantum key for this meeting. No one must know what we are discussing.”
All 17 of them absorb the four-dimensional construct that will allow them to converse in isolation, their waveform impossible to comingle with any other without their knowledge.
“This meeting couldn’t come at a more crucial time,” Hanikori said. “The most naïve of the Guardian ambassadors, Diver, has gone beyond her usual silly projects — recently she had cadets catch fish in their teeth — and is now revealing herself to the barbarians called the People. These are nothing more than killers, and yet she has blinded herself to their natures.”
“What of it, Hanikori?” Putnomo interrupted. “Let her waste her time while they destroy themselves.”
“You are many light years from them,” Hanikori answered. “We are only six. She may already be breaking her oath and leaking technical information to them. I believe her objectivity may be compromised.  If she persists, in a millennia or two, they may well develop the means to threaten not only us, but other nearby species.”
“Hanikori, you are a politician and you excel at the age-old craft of frightening the populace. I am a scientist,” Putnomo said. “The People could not become a threat to us in ten millennia, even if they survive.”
“Are you willing to bet the future of all life on that, Putnomo?” Green interrupted with disgust. “Perhaps you won’t feel so complacent when you learn that Far Flier  tells you that the Guardian Council says you must make do with less energy for your lightspeed engine development. When he tells you the energy is needed to continue shifting People to timelines where they haven’t blown themselves up, you will surely reconsider.”
 “Enough,” Hanikori thundered, the waveform vibrating with his intensity. “Let us not forget our purpose today.”
“Thank you,” Putnomo said. “Whatever our differing opinions about Diver and Earth, we can all agree that the most important thing is to press ahead with our work on e12.”
Only they know that e12 is the latest iteration in their top-secret research they have been carrying out for more than a thousand years. 
 “I have excellent news to report,” Putnomo said. “About 1,100 years ago, we Guarded a very unusual species on the outer edges of the Eta Carinae nebula. It was the only life, let alone intelligent life, that we have ever found that was composed of only organized gas and plasma. We learned very little about it before Eta Carinae erupted in a small nova that destroyed the region. For those of you who are new to our efforts, it was this encounter that started Hanikori and myself and a few others to realize that with some effort, this kind of life could be immortal.
 “Three things had to be solved to make that happen. The first – reducing an individual’s consciousness to free-standing waves –– is already something all of our species could do, if we had not bound ourselves foolishly to retain our ancient forms. The second was how to overcome entropy – how can a waveform, in essence, eat while still retaining its essential nature? The third was how to continue to manipulate matter while remaining pure energy.”
Hanikori could hardly contain his impatience. Putnomo was always so impressed with himself. “So what have you learned recently?”
He let them see his laboratory, hidden by a cloud of comets. Inside, a force field in which only a large plasma cloud existed, suspended by intense magnetic fields. They watched as Putnomo donned a helmet on his homeworld, nearly a billion kilometers away. For a few seconds nothing happened and then Putnomo allowed them to entangle with the plasma cloud itself, through him. And then he broke his connection with them.
The waveform shuddered as they all gasped. The plasma cloud retained much of Putnomo’s consciousness. In fact, it shifted gradually as the entangled with it.
Putnomo reconnected with them. “Yes, I was able to project my consciousness into the cloud, and while it couldn’t think entirely new thoughts, it did react to you in small ways. For the first time, we have created consciousness in a cloud of plasma.”
The waveform pulsed with approval and delight. Even Hanikori was impressed.
“Are there fundamental issues you still need to address?” he wondered.
“Not fundamental ones, no. We have maybe a decade or two of engineering before we can attempt a full transfer, and then perhaps some more time to ensure stability. But there is every reason to believe that we have found a way to preserve consciousness for all time. In short, to be immortal.”
“And what about the third obstacle,”  Green asked. “Does any of this bode well for addressing that?”
“We have been working in parallel on that. We chose the confined plasma precisely because we have known for millennia how to control it. It was one of the main technologies of the controlled fusion era. Reversing that, having the plasma control ordinary matter, is challenging but conceptually well understood.” Putnomo was in all his glory now. “I feel strongly that we are perhaps 100 years away from a demonstration combining conscious energy and material control.”
Hanikori steered them back to the immediate threat. “All the more reason to not waste time or resources on foolishness. The lightspeed engine project is our cover story, and we need to keep the project alive, even if it’s mostly fake.”
“What is your proposal?” asked Putnomo.
Hanikori hesitated. He wasn’t interested in fully revealing his plans. “For now, we should all exercise vigilance over this ridiculous project with the People. And we must lay the groundwork for us to turn the Guardians from the naïve fostering of any kind of conscious life to the further development of our species, who are the highest form of consciousness.”
“What is at stake,” he continued, “is nothing less than the evolution of conscious life itself. In a million millennia, only 20 species have in the entire galaxy have reached the stage of enhanced life. Should we spend another billion years hoping to find a few more? And leave ourselves vulnerable to forces beyond our control? To the whims of supernovas? To attack from far corners of the galaxy, or from beings in other galaxies who have gone beyond us in lightspeed travel or solved the riddle of faster than light travel?”
“We have earned immortality, and we deserve it. Let us turn the Guardians from this foolish philosophy of naïve benevolence to one of true Guardianship – of our species, and our future.”
The meeting is over, and Hanikori feels minds drop away. But Green lingers.
“Are you not concerned about this development with this Raefe?” he asks. Hanikori was being unusually eliptical about it.
“I am quite concerned,” Hanikori said. “But I have a plan.”
“Care to share it,” Green asks. “We’ve been in this together for a long time.”
“And we will share a victory toast. Soon. For now, the most good you can do is to keep an eye on Diver. She is such a foolish being. Let me know at once if you sense anything notable.”</Text>

            <Title>Cadets soar</Title>
            <Synopsis>Diver addresses her class</Synopsis>
            <Text>Diver stood on her balcony, looking out over the flooded canyons hundreds of meters below. Day was coming to A’Nonto. The breeze brought the first hint of warmth from Prime’s dawn to her face, and decorated the water with a dance of foam, pink in the sun’s rising red light. Higher in the sky, the Twins still shined orange against the black of space. 
She smiled, thinking of the stories the ancients had about their sky. Prime was Mother, and the Twins were First Father and Second Father. The planets were their children. They thought the Fathers were doing a mating dance with Mother, and that the children were approaching her for food.
How could she convey to her cadets what pre-enhanced beings were like? Without that understanding, they would fail in their mission, even with species that were highly scientific, if not yet enhanced. They would not understand what it was like to live entirely in the physical world. They understood emotions and myths – enhancement didn’’t obliterate that – but they wouldn’t really understand the power that either had over the civilizations they would observe and work with. And they would certainly not be capable of facing the destruction of their worlds, and guiding their contacts through new timelines.
She would share with them her experiences with Raefe. These months of first contact and nurture were often the most delicate, and for them to be able to witness and discuss would be particularly useful to them when they had to do this themselves.
Her group included eight who were A’Mopto, her species, and so were here on this world. Normally, that didn’t matter – all the cadets entangled and their physical presence was irrelevant. She was going to shake things up though. Her time with Raefe had made her realize that certain things had been lacking from their training regimen and she was going to try something new. 
Prime was full now, the sky a soothing pink, and the Twins hot orange spots in the distance. A’Nonto’s brothers,  B’Nonte and C’Noono, were in night now. Soon they would perform their complex dance across the day, the changing light powering the thermal cycle that all life on the planet lived by. Today, there would be one window of almost two hours that she thought would be just perfect for her class. This was going to be fun!
A few hours later, she dimmed the lights in her quarters and sat upright and alert. She found the wormhole interface network and felt herself join the stream. She found the thread that was her class and soon could feel the 48 other minds that were her students. All would be from the six surface dwellers among the Guardians. The three marine species and the two underground species would each train in their own clusters, at first. For all of these cadets, this would be their first experiences with extended entanglements with other species. Long experience had shown that the sensory differences between different living modalities could be too much for some rookies. Later, though, they would all experience each species’ sensorium. It was vital to developing broad empathy for other lifeforms.
She led them through very basic exercises to be able to identify each other’s consciousness, to send and receive messages. They were bright and quick and took to it at once. They were ready for the next step.
“Excellent! You have all prepared well and will have no trouble being part of this training group. But when you are done with training, and begin the long work of Guarding, you will be working with species that can only communicate in a limited way with you. More importantly, most of you will work with species that have no connection to the stream, or can’t control what little connection they have. They live in the world all of our ancestors lived in, whether that was 10,000 years ago, as the A’Mopto, my species, did, or one million years ago as you Alaxazayawa did, or only 700 years ago, as the HooHooHu did.
“And that world is one dominated by unenhanced experience of whatever original biologic senses your assigned species have. Maybe they will have some electronic or mechanical aids – mine have computers, books, videos, audios and other means –– but even those they experience through the senses.” She gave them a brief glimpse of what Raefe saw in all these media. 
“Wow!” one of the cadets exclaimed. “These forms are strangely devoid of information, yet so energetic.”
“Yes, everything is sound and color, with no appreciation for frequencies and wavelengths beyond their senses,” another thought.
“But hard to ignore,” a third added. “And impossible to turn off, at least some of it.”
 “Yes, we can feel the two most important things about these experiences,” Diver replied. “Yes, they are unenhanced –they don’t have the data context that helps them to understand what they are experiencing. So much more than us, they must process over time – sometimes long periods – to penetrate the surface of their own experiences. Perhaps most importantly, up to 100% of the content of these documents and images are emotional. You will find that ‘impossible to turn off,’ too.”
“What emotions can they have about something they don’t understand?” asked a student.
“You are asking that because you can get to the truth about so many things in a fraction of a millisecond and then you can form feelings based on how that truth meshes with what you already know and feel. Maybe you don’t always do that, not actually, but you feel that you do. Not so for the unenhanced and unentangled. And this is one of the most important aspects of their lives you must learn to resonate with.
“Because early in every species life, neither the individual nor the species can always wait until they have learned the truth in order to act as they must to survive. So most young species develop a complex system of parallel, intertwining and recursive logic and emotion. To put it simply, ideally they act emotionally, analyze the results logically, and modify their emotions accordingly in an endless cycle. Realistically, emotions can be hard to change, truth hard to find, and yet they still must act to survive. So sometimes they act counter to their true survival needs. That is the primary cause of the failure of intelligent species to survive.”
She could feel their confusion. They had been raised exactly to mesh emotion with thought, to mesh their own perceptions with others. They could not contemplate a life without constant iteration and refinement of their own ideas, a life where blind action was frequently required.
“But today we are going to tackle something much more basic – the physicality of young species. You are all enhanced, you live a rich life full of sensor input and data augmentation. We know that we are still primarily based in physical sensation, and so we each honor that in various ways that help keep us sane and balanced. My species still consumes physical food on occasion. We give birth. You each have your own ways.
“On my world, we play games where we throw a ball and try to hit a target. Some like to do it with very little help from enhancement,” one of the cadets offered.
“Yes, that’s the kind of thing I mean. But you do it for amusement, or maybe out of sense of it being somehow healthy. I want you to consider what it’s like for those who live solely in that way – for species where throwing a rock is how they kill prey for food, for example. Until you can begin to see that,  you will have a lot of trouble establishing rapport and understanding the individuals you contact and work with. But we are going to help you fix that!
“I will tell you a bit of the story of my world, in the way that my ancestors would have told it. Learning origin stories is vital to understanding some of the deep suppositions any species have, so we’ll start with mine. And then we will perform a ritual that marks entry in the adult world for my species.
“First, there was a brood of three, a female and two males, who lived in the sky. Mother, was bigger than the other two and often bossed them around and took their food. So First Father and Second Father flew a bit away from Mother to avoid her.
“But First Father flew back to Mother and she gave birth to a female and two males as well -- A’Nonto and her two brothers,  B’Nonte and C’’Noono. When First Father flew back to Second Father to tell him the joyful news, Second Father grew jealous. The two Fathers fell to fighting and have been circling each other ever since.  They neglected their duties to bring food to Mother.
“So the younglings never grew and became bright and large, like Mother. Instead, they had to stay in Mother’s nest, forever circling around each other. Still they did grow some, and A’Nonto, in particular, became very beautiful. Mother was red and big, and B’Nonte and C’Noono were small and reddish, but of course not glowing like Mother. But A’Nonto had many colors and textures. She was covered with plants of many colors, and blue water, and brown rocks.
“One day, Second Father, still jealous of First Father’s offspring, could stand it no longer. He saw a family of comets passing by and hurled them at A’Nonto. He wanted to hurt Mother’s prize baby. The comets crashed on A’Nonto, making giant cracks in it, and filling them with the water from the melted comets. When it was all done, A’Nonto had lost much of her beautiful coat of plants.
“All the creatures on A’Nonto ran for the highest ground. They saw that all the land where they had found plants and hunted animals were under water. What remained were water-filled canyons, with steep sides and slippery precipes and small caves for them to live in.
What would they eat? Sandicar, who was young and brave, saw the silver flash of fish in the waters all around him. He dove off the cliff and caught a fish in his mouth. He climbed back up and showed it to the others. Soon, the A’Mopto became a diving and fishing species. Catching the fish wasn’t hard – the A’Mopto are fast swimmers and have strong jaws. But climbing back up the cliffs was hard and dangerous. 
“One day, Second Father disappeared – he was nowhere to be seen. Shortly thereafter, a baby was born whose skin crossed from her back to her arms. When she was old enough to dive, she jumped off the cliff and spread her arms. The air held her up –– she could fly! Second Father felt bad about what he had done and gave the A’Mopto a gift. At first, the flyers worked for the rest, but after many generations, all A’Mopto has become flyers, as we are today.
“In my culture, this is our central myth, our central story. We never have fully escaped seeing things through that lens. And we never have fully lost the desire to jump off a tall cliff and fly. In fact, to prove that, my parents named me Diver, the same as the female who first flew.
“The species you will work with, their sense of these stories will be much stronger. So I want you to understand the power of your bodies, as they will understand and dwell in the power of theirs. Later we will do the same with emotions.
“My fellow A’Mopto cadets and I will enact the coming of age ritual of repeating the original Diver’s first flight. We have done this ourselves when we were young, and we had to do it without using enhancement. We will repeat that today, with the exception that we will remain entangled with you. As we return, we will restore some of our enhancement, so that you can understand the speed and power of what we are doing in the usual way. But I urge you to pay most attention to the first part of the flight.
She left her quarters and met the others at the end of the hall, where there was a great ledge overlooking the water. They lined up on the ledge in the customary three ranks of three, with Diver in the front middle, and next most senior two on her left and right. She let them see the flight path in her mind. They stood for a few seconds, letting the wind fill their extend arms. In threes they ran off the ledge, letting the air currents fill their armwings. Their minds joined with each other, so that the whole group could see what each could see. The other cadets joined with them, too. Each of the flyers absorbed their share of the other cadets, so that the cadets could feel both the individual and group sensations.
It was a beautiful day for a First Flight ceremony. Prime bathed them in warm light, the air currents coming up through the canyon walls were strong but steady. If they had looked up, they would see the Twins and one of the other planets. But their eyes were straight or down, watching the water. She let the all the cadets feel how their arms instinctively made continuous movements to keep them aloft. How occasional breezes buffeted them, sometimes triggering a squirt of fear, and then recovery. Even without enhancement, they could see far and clear as small flashes of silver marked where schools of fish swam below.
She smiled and her fellow flyers knew what was about to happen. Without warning, Diver tucked her arms in and kicked her feet, releasing the smaller flaps of skin tucked between her three large toes. She used these small wings to guide her descent. All nine rocketed downward in formation, now moving at over 100 kilometers a second. At 20 meters above the water, she led the first rank into a steeper final dive. The second rank passed over them, and the third rank passed over the second rank.
Diver’s rank hit the water with arms and feet together, plowing into the back of a school of fish. She felt her mouth close around a good sized fish before her legs went under the surface. The school lurched forward, only to be hit by the second rank. The third rank hit a second later. Within seconds, all nine had caught a fish large enough for one meal for one person.
They arched their backs, extend their toes, and let their momentum carry them above the surface. A kick and a surge of their arms launched them just high enough to repeat the motion in the air, and then they high enough to catch the first air currents.
They headed to a ceremonial site on the far shore of the canyon. She turned her attention to the rest of the cadets. They were a little stunned – most of them had never experienced this level of unenhanced physical activity. Only one other species could fly at all without technology. And none of the land dwellers had hunted fish, nor had any of them felt the coolness of water break your dive from 100 meters high.
They landed at the ceremonial site. Before the other cadets could reflect more, the nine each killed their fish with their teeth and handed it to another, simulating first Diver’s bringing of food for her brood. The others ate the raw fish quickly -- her fellow A’Moptos were not themselves fond of primitive eating. But Diver chewed slowly, letting all savor the life force in the fish meat, the subtle tastes it had, and the way it felt in her mouth.
Diver swallowed the last little bit.
“Now, you have seen what it is like to depend on your body to eat and to battle with other life for survival. So when you meet the species you will be Guarding, remember that this battle for sustenance and life has informed their entire existence. Most of them will be much more advanced, but only recently so. These experiences will be embedded in their culture, their minds, their entire bodies. You can help them to see that they can move forward from this, but you cannot pretend yourselves nor ask them to pretend that they can ignore these experiences and impulses. You can only ask them to harness these for new survival challenges.
“And when you come to doing that, then you will fully understand the joy and beauty of guardianship. And you will be truly enhanced.”
The waveform slowly died out, leaving her with the remnants of their surprise, curiousity and gratitude. They might never experience this again. She was glad it had gone well, for now she had to get back to Raefe. She could not rush things on Earth, but she could not think in Guardian time either. They had years, not centuries.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Raefe visits Alton</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raefe had been walking through the ruins of South Staten Island for two hours, trying to find the New Voodo colony. It was a hard slog. Even though it been 15 years since the Great Iceberg tidal wave had ripped through Arthur Kill and Richmond Creek, tearing Staten Island into two, the giant old landfills were still marshy and treacherous, with the occasional rusty object ready to rip your shins. It would have been nice if Lina was here. At least they could help each other if one of them was injured.
He’d taken Diver’s advice and not told Lina about his dream. He’d been trying to figure out how to explain coming here on his own, when luck would have it, Lina had picked up a job translating for some East African officials who were touring the East coast. That saved him from lying to her, at least for now.
 He wasn’t even sure what he would do here. Diver had said that Winchester could entangle, too. How many people could do that? Were their people who could see inside his mind? Would he get better at this, and be able to read their thoughts? The whole thing was a bit overwhelming. People often said something felt like a dream. They really had no idea!
Finally, he saw a grove in the distance. No sooner than he saw it, two men eased out from behind a boulder. One wore the yellow and black colors of the New Voodo Army. He had made it.
 &quot;Hey, we saw you walking this way, and you’ve got the black and yellow cap on. Mind if we ask your business in these parts?&quot;
 &quot;No, no problem. I'm looking for Alton Winchester. We had some email, he's expecting me.&quot;
 &quot;What you want with Alton?&quot;
 Ah, so maybe they thought he was government or one of the corporate security people.
 &quot;He invited me for the water ceremony. Just trying to learn.&quot;
 &quot;Oh yeah, you're in the right place, the man in the black and yellow cap said.  &quot;Alton, he loves to teach. I'm Hector -- that's Robert.&quot; He said it in the Haitian way.
 They walked for a while and Hector led him to a house-sized building made out of old shipping containers.
 Hector knocked and Alton came out. All smiles, he gave Raefe a bear hug.
 “Young Raefe, you are just in time. Come!”
Inside there were about 50 people, sitting on small stools in a wide circle. Alton motioned and two people  made a gap for him. Someone brought him a stool. Alton walked to the center. 
 &quot;When the great flood destroyed our community, we knew that we had angered the World. Not our community, but all of humanity had angered the World, through our disrespect for the water, for the animals, for plants that the sun brings. And so we called upon the forgotten knowledge of our ancestors, from Haiti and from Africa, to help us rebuild this world.&quot;
 &quot;Today, we dedicate ourselves to the Water, to cleanse what we have made dirty, to reclaim the water we have wasted.&quot;
 “Amen!” the circle answered.
&quot;What is the color of the water spirit?&quot;
 &quot;Blue&quot; they replied.
 &quot;Let us make the water blue.&quot;
 Two people brought up a barrel, covered with a sort of funnel filled with a honeycomb. Two more poured a barrel of brackish water. Raefe could hear the slow splash of the water as trickled to the bottom of the barrel. One side of the circle began to sing.
“We take the salt from water!”
And the other side answered.
“We make salt for our food!”
And it continued that way, while some of the children hit tambourines, imitating the slow drip of the water.
“We take the metal from the water!”
“And make tools for our work”
“We take the germs from the water!”
“And make medicines for the sick”
This went on for a while, the singers getting more creative as they went, the children adding a dance to their drumming. Finally, the two people at the barrel raised their arms and the whole room sang “Amen!” as they brought them down with a flourish. The two then lifted the funnel, now heavy with sludge, and marched out of the room.
Everyone gathered by the barrel, dipping small cups to fill them with water. Alton raised his over his head.
“Water, we have made you blue again!” And he drank the cup.
“Blue water!” everyone answered, and drank theirs. Raefe just watched, unsure of what to do.
“Go ahead, my friend,“ Alton smiled. “See what pure water really tastes like.” He handed him one of the small cups.
Raefe dipped it and brought it to his lips to drink and hesitated.
“Ah, you are worried, it seems different, odd,” Alton said.
“I can’t put my finger on it, but yeah, there’s something off.”
“Do you know what pure water smells like?” Alton asked.
“Never thought about it, no.”
“Go ahead, put your nose just above the water and inhale. What do you smell?”
Raefe sniffed. And then inhaled deeply.
“Sorry, nothing.”
Alton beamed. “Do you see now that the water you have drunk your whole life has always had some smell? Maybe it was polluted, or had too many bacteria, or chemicals to make it safe, or salt from the ocean. Yes, it was only a little of those things, but your brain expects a faint smell in water. Even primitive people know not to drink water that smells unless they have no choice. And we, my friend, have had no choice. But now we do, so drink up!”
Alton wanted to show him the rest of the settlement. There were more than a dozen other small structures, all made from shipping containers or scrap metal, or something else discarded that they had transformed into houses.
“What do you see?” Alton asked.
“Honestly, I see a typical drifter camp,” Raefe answered, hoping he hadn’t offended him.
“Exactly!” Alton said, oddly delighted. “Just what the spy sats see. Now let me show you what you didn’t see.”
They walked over to a stand of trees. Close up, Raefe could see that there was a thin band of film about 2 feet high wrapped around the larger branches about a two-thirds of the way up the tree. Thin wires from them spiraled down the tree trunk into the ground.
“These are strain gauge films,” Alton explained. “When they are compressed, the naturally generate a small current. In this case, when the tree bends in any direction from the wind, the films generate electricity. We make the film from scrap plastic in the old landfill and some of the metals and salts from the water – it will take us decades to use it up.”
They walked on to a small pit, filled with an odd kind of grayish mud.
“This pit we filled with four alternating layers of concrete and scrap plastic. We did that four times, to make it as impermeable as possible. Then we filled it with alternating layers of the salts and metals we remove from the water.”
“I get it – it’s a giant battery.”
“Yes, just so. The trees charge this up, and then we use it for our power. We don’t use a lot of power, but we get it all from the trees. We are working on ways to collect energy from the sun, too, but we haven’t yet figured out just how to do that without creating new pollution – a lot of the solar panel stuff can be toxic. But we will solve it, soon.”
They walked around for two hours, Alton showing him all the clever ways they had created a village that was cleaning up the old landfill just by existing. The honeycomb funnel was actually a reverse osmosis gadget that was built from altered plastic milk jugs. The houses were built on piles of old tires that stabilized the marsh. A small portion of the leeches and slugs that were everywhere were harvested and used for bait or animal feed or fertilizer. There was little here that came from the mainland.
Despite the breeze rippling the trees, it was hot and the marshey land lent a steady mugginess to the air. They found some shade and Alton offered Raefe a canteen full of cool water.
“I’m glad I came, Alton. I had no idea stuff like this was happening.”
“Yeah, well the vids ain’t into spreading knowledge much.”
“Authentic. How are you going to really change anything though? I mean, this is great, but there aren’t even 100 people here.”
“Now. But these people will move on, as did many before them. A few thousand people have come here before. Each of them left on a mission, to restore other damaged places like this, other people, and start more Voodo Villages.”
Raefe smiled. “What’s that about, the voodoo part?”
“You’re a college boy, right?”
“Trying to be,” he said sheepishly. “My folks probably wouldn’t be too happy knowing I’m not home studying.”
“See, right there. You got folks, they did what they could to send you to college. Most of these people, they’re wanderers. No home, their families scattered to the winds. These kids, most of them have never been to a school.”
Raefe was skeptical. “Why not?”
“You remember that snow crew on the train? How you think their kids go to school? Their parents go north in the winter, the kids who should be in middle school look after the little kids, the older kids do odd jobs and cook for the other ones. Maybe the take care of the old people, too. They used to come and go in school, when they could, but then most places, they tightened up the rules and too many absences, they toss them. So they went from little school to no school.”
“Man, that’s messed up. Why’d they do that?”
Alton eyed him. Raefe could feel his mind. Was Raefe being naïve or pretending ignorance?
“You’ve got to look at the big picture. The whole world’s playing a game of musical chairs, just waiting for the music to stop. The corpos, the pols, they got chairs with their names right on ‘em. The people who still got regular jobs, who maybe got a house, who might be able to send their kids to college – the want every advantage for them and theirs.”
Raefe felt torn. He knew there was something to what Alton was saying, but it also seemed a little over the top. He’d never heard his parents say anything about depriving other people.
“I gotta say, I was never taught that.”
“Fish never taught the water is wet, but all the same. You were taught it’s a tough world, and you have to work hard, and nobody does you any favors. But if you study, and don’t rock the boat, things will work out. How close am I?”
“Pretty close.”
“You think the people you grew up with work harder than those snow crews? You think these people here, who can turn garbage into water and energy, you think they didn’t have to study? You think if they don’t rock the boat, that college of yours will all of a sudden be full of Haitian rasta kids?”
“No, I got that. I’m not that sheltered, and even if I was, Lina would straighten me out.”
“You just were wishing some of it was true, some of it was real.”
Maybe he was. What could anyone do if everything was a lie, if it was all just bullshit?
“It is a lie,” Alton said, as if he read his mind. “It’s the lie that made the ice melt, the lie that turned California into a desert, the lie that makes white trash still living in the 20th century think it would be even better to live in the 19th century as long as they ain’t the slaves. Whatever’s true in all of that, don’t matter. It’s how we got here, to this time and this place. It’s not how we’re ever going to fix it.”
“How are you going to fix it?” Raefe wondered.
Alton laughed. “Little brother, I have no idea. I’m just doing what I can. And I know I’m not the only one. Do you really think all we can do after 2 million years of evolution is wait for the ocean to cover the world? For all the trees to die?”
Raefe wanted to tell him that it might not work out, that intelligent life had destroyed itself in many places before. But why, he thought? Alton already understood that, on some level, despite his bravado.
“How did you get into this?” Raefe asked him. He half wondered if Diver had touched Alton, too.
“My father worked for Exxon Gulf, one of the big oil conglomerates. He was a chemical engineer. He was the first black man to become chief engineer for a major oil company. His father was the first person in his family to finish college. His ancestors were slaves. He was a very proud man. He would tell me, ‘Alton, I have a PhD and I’m the boss of hundreds of men and women, of every color, all around the world. But my great, great, however many greats, grandfather or mother, they probably were just as smart as me. Maybe smarter, since they had to survive hell with no help. So don’t you go putting on airs.’
 “In 2021, his company discovered oil in Haiti, which was a giant surprise. He went there to lead the exploration. I was just in school then. In Haiti, the multinationals had schools for their people. But still, I learned Creole from the locals. Then that cholera epidemic hit in ’28, bigger than the one after the earthquake. Bad timing, because the last half of ’28, Hurricane Heather happened. The first hurricane to stall and become a month long superstorm. The winds drove many animals out of the interior forests in Haiti, including bats. So the bat virus came to where we lived, and people were dying in droves. The airlines shut down, and the US Navy patrolled the coast, shooting any boats with people trying to escape. 
“That was when I first understood about the game of musical chairs. In the aftermath, some of the people from the oil companies got together with some of the locals and tried to rebuild. That was when I discovered that the illiterate people that we were living in the midst of were actually quite educated. They knew a lot about nature, about their own history, about how to make a community out of a group of people. But it was all oral. It was all songs and ceremonies. So while we teach the kids here to read and write, we don’t depend just on that. We’re trying to create a culture, one that can transcend all the barriers of language, religion and even class.”
Raefe could feel Alton’s sadness and anger. But he could also feel the steely determination to be better, to be smarter, to be more determined. To be better people, he felt that thought in Alton.
“Just before the New Confederate Army boarded that train, Lina and I were talking about the future. No one wants to talk about the future. ‘It’s too depressing.’’ But why are we even bothering going to college? Why would we even bother to have kids? I feel like I want to do something, but I have no clue about what.”
“I feel your heart,” Alton said. “It’s not pure, but it is true. There are so many little pockets like this everywhere, all struggling to turn the tide, to retake our future from people who only think about being on top, and never about what carnage is under their feet, and how slippery their perch is. We don’t raise our children to be wolves, and we don’t want to be ruled by them either. Hector, he has a saying: every plant can split a rock to find water or sun.”
“Nice thought.”
“Yes, but what does it mean? I know you are asking that. So are we. I think you are one of us, and you are just discovering that. I know you are not going to come live here, I know you will find other ways and other people. Maybe that is your mission, to roam the world and tell all of our stories, to let us know we are not alone.”
“Thank you for saying that, for helping me see that anything is better than nothing. I hope I can do more.”
Alton tussled his hair. “Little brother, you have so much inside you. You keep in touch.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Hanikori and Green conspire</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter &lt;$n&gt;
Green and Hanikori discuss their progress and strategy. Hanikori begins by telling Green how important it is to manage their follow conspirators.  
Green, you and I understand our true nature and that of species in general. As we draw closer to success, we will need to be ever more vigilant to manage our brothers. The quest that has taken us this close to success on E12 and our vision to establish a higher order among all species will be challenged by our own limitations. This is what has held back the Ranoldi evolution and that of others—this fear of achieving true control of our universe. Through e12 we will finally rid ourselves of doubts that we have artfully disguised as some type of altruistic vision among all species. 
“So what are you suggesting Hanikori? I share your concern but feel that we must count on our fellow conspirators if we are to succeed. Look at the technical progress that Putnomo has made.”  
And that’s exactly the paradox Green. The closer we get to our ultimate vision—to this higher order and new relationships, the more even our high capacity brothers might start to waiver. Petty jealousies like I have detected recently can lead to our undoing.
By the way, I just received an urgent encrypted message from Levilon saying that he wants to share something. This is what worries me. We need our fellow brothers but can we really count on them to make the right decisions and to stay strong? Yes we recruited them because they stood our as un-poisoned by the ridiculous Ranoldi credo. And yes, each brings a clear capacity. BUT……I still worry.
Anyway, I will follow up with Levilon. I assume that his little committee has come up with something. I’ll let you know.
In the meantime I want you to spend even more time with Putnomo. Is it really possible that we are within let’s say 20 Ronaldi years of success? Think about it Green. No more fear of an uncertain future. Our ability to provide order and meaning to the universe; to save other species from having to navigate the great unknown. You and I——and others of course once things settle—will be able to make decisions for the common good. For the good of the universe!  It’s truly a remarkable point in time.

            <Synopsis>Visit to Miami</Synopsis>
            <Text>January, 2050
They took the redeye solar train south, sleeping most of the way. Just after dawn, they arrived in Miami. The station was only blocks from the water, so they headed down to the seaport. Raefe had pictured a lone dock, but it was a madhouse of boats of all sorts. They found the power station boat and stowed their gear with the crew. 
“You want to get some breakfast?” Raefe asked.
“Definitely, but not here. It’s all generic,” Lina said. “Let’s find some local grub. I want an authentic Cubano. I told Kayam I was going to check up on his stuff down here, see if he’s been feeding me the real deal all this time.”
The water taxis were down the other end, past a long line of ferries.
“Wow, there’s one to Cuba, another to the Bahamas,” Lina noted. “Lot of people passing through here.”
“There’s another to Haiti. Spanish, English, French — take your pick,” Raefe said.
“Reminds me of Africa,” Lina smiled. “Different Asians, though — looks mostly Viet or Thai here.” 
“Yeah, that Rooster boat company sent them here after the floods,” Raefe said. “No more roads, no more cars.”
The far end of the dock was crowded with the iconic Bangkok boats — long, thin boats with big fuel cell motors mounted high up on the back, and 3-meter drive shafts angled out the back driving the propeller.
A small Asian man caught their attention with his spikey yellow hair and matching eyeglass frames. “Where you going?” he asked. “I can take you cheap.”
“Where’s the best Cubano?” Lina asked. “Can you take us there?”
“Ten bucks to South Beach Island. Great food there. My cousin, she runs best Cuban Vietnamese joint on the island. Eight bucks if you go there. Tell her Minh sent you.”
“Cuban Vietnamese — never had that,” Raefe said. “What’s good there?”
“You have pastrami bon me, best in Miami. Great Cubano. Maybe you try Viet coffee, too.”
“Deal,” Lina said. “ But can you come back for us in an hour? We’ve got to make another boat.”
“Too bad,” Minh said. “You’ll miss the best sights. You come back in the afternoon, the whole seaport will be filled with rich old people, with all of their enhanced animals. Last night, they had a dance contest for chimps. Big fun.”
“Who won?” Raefe asked.
“I heard it was a chimp named Bieber — he does some old dance called Funky Chicken. Too late for me, though — got to work at dawn.”
“Well, we’ll be back in a few days,” Lina said. “Maybe then. ”
The restaurant was only ten minutes away. Minh wasn’t kidding, the food was great. You could get good bon me in Boston, but not with stir-fried pastrami, smoked with jerked spice. The Cubano was a treat — Kayam’s version was more Cairo than Cubano and Lina was going give him a good ribbing when they went back home. 
Back at the seaport, things were in full swing now as the workday was well under way. Electric motorbikes weaved between big trucks, all carrying food, appliances, clothes and people to islands near and far. They found their way to the power station boat, an old converted dredging barge. A couple of dozen people were onboard, milling about. A middle-aged man jumped up on top of the cabin in the middle of the boat.
“Hello, I’m Bob Magnuson, project coordinator for the Miami Terrace Dynamic Tidal Power Station construction project, which means I make the coffee and pay the bills. I want to thank you all for coming. For the next three days, you will be living on small artificial island about 15 kilometers from here. The island will become actually part of the power station, but for now, it’s where you’ll bunk while we work. On behalf of the whole team, I want to thank you all for volunteering. On the way out, I’ll talk with each of you and we’ll figure out what you’re going to each do. So settle in and enjoy the ride — it’ll be about an hour from here.”
There were no deck chairs or benches, so Raefe and Lina propped their packs against the railing running around the edge of the boat. and sat down. Once the barge got under way, there was a pleasant breeze. The water was calm, the sun was shining and Raefe was looking forward to getting out in the water.
“Hey, I’m Tina, I work with Bob. You are?”
“I’m Lina, he’s Raefe.”
“Well, welcome. And thanks for coming down. Have you done this before?”
“I haven’t,” said Raefe. “I worked on a windfarm up in Vermont last year, though.”
“I was raised on the Indian Ocean,” said Lina. “I’ve never built a dam, but I’ve worked on fish farms. You go down and get the fish out of their cages, or put fry in them, or whatever needs doing.”
“Interesting,” Tina said. “You wont’ be diving much out here, though. The actual construction work is pretty trick, and we have trained construction workers working out there. You’ll mostly be helping them — passing supplies, taking away scrap, and so on. It might not seem like much, but those guys can go twice as fast because you’re helping them. And if it wasn’t for that, the project would be too expensive to get funded. So you’re making the Miami Terra Dynamic Tidal Power Station possible.”
“What exactly does all that mean — Miami Terrace, Dynamic Tidal Power?” Raefe asked.
“Miami Terrace is an ocean plateau about 15 clicks out. There’s a long reef that extends up from the bottom for many kilometers along the terrace, which is actually pretty deep. The reef died in the tidal wave in 2041. So much debris piled up on it that it choked, basically. But the good news is that it forms a very solid foundation for the DPT, the power station. We’re building what’s essentially a dam, about 30 kilometers long, pointing sort of northeast out into the ocean. When the tides go in and out, they’re different heights on either side of the dam. There’s machinery inside the dam that let’s the high side flow to the low side, and that flow powers turbines which turn generators.”
“So it’s just sitting out there in the ocean, unattached to the land? I was picturing something in a little bay, with the tide going in and out.”
“That wouldn’t work here, so no, it’s not attached to the land. We’ll be out there for three days, off the grid basically.”
“I like the sound of that,” Lina said. “My Voice never shut up the whole train ride down — bad news, bad music, cheesy and one million ads. I refused to even turn my glasses puter on — if I see one more cheesy Grandpa Mumford video, I’ll recycle breakfast.”
“No worries there,” Tina laughed. “It’s all live and in person on this rig. Hey, you look beat from the trip — catch some sleep if you can, because we start right away in about 45 minutes.”
***
The afternoon had gone well. Around 6, some of the construction workers grabbed spear fishing rigs and brought back some grouper and snapper. They were all gathered on a 2 meter-wide concrete wall about 3 meters off the water, extending hundreds of meters in both directions. Where they were, the wall passed through a turret, a circular platform about 10 meters wide and 20 meters long. This was their “island.” Poles on on the outside of the walls extended upward, supporting a kind of open-sided tent. It would protect them from sun and rain, but not wind.
 Sun, sea and work  had made them all famished. They had cooked the fish on some gas grills and practically inhaled it. Some of the team had formed a half-assed drumming circle, banging not quite in rhythm on a bunch of empty metal containers. Raefe and Lina drifted toward the other end of the turret, facing out to the open ocean.
“This was a good idea,” Raefe said. “Thanks for making me come.”
“I don’t remember making you,” Lina said.
“No, but I didn’t really want to go. My headaches often get worse in unfamiliar surroundings, and it makes me shy away from leaving the nest. But this is not only beautiful, but authentic. Is this our thing — cleaning up the mess?”
“Yeah, maybe. I mean, we’d probably both do this kind of thing on our own, don’t you think?”
“Right, cause that’s how we met. Everyone accepts that we’re stuck with the Slide, that it’s just our bad luck. But I like that we can at least undo some of it.”
“Is that how you see this?”
“I guess. Why did you want to do it?”
“Free digs for a week.”
“No saving the world for you, eh?”
“Saving the world, let me see,” Lina paused, looking out to see. “Saving the world to me means surviving and thriving. The Slide done slid all over people like me. I look for ways to fight back.”
They were lying on their backs, staring up at the night sky.
“You know what’s best about the ocean at night?” Lina asked. :Look up.”
“Wow. I’ve never seen so many stars.”
“In Efricar, my dad’s project was far from the city and it was like this every night. I miss it — the vastness of the sky, the richness of it. Long ago, everyone saw the night sky like this, before pollution and electricity. You can just imagine a couple of fishermen or shepherds sitting out like this a thousand years ago and making up stories about the stars, just to pass the time. No vids, no Voice, just their imagination.”
“I never thought of that. We can’t even start to imagine something without thinking ‘that reminds me of’ some sooty vid hyping some crap product.”
They lay on their backs for awhile watching the stars, squealing over an occasional meteorite, hoping no one saw them steal an occasional kiss or caress. Despite their best intentions, they were drifting off to sleep, exhausted from the day.
“What’s that,” Lina bolted upright. “Can you hear that?”
“Sounds like motor boats. Let’s go find the others and see what’s up.”
They ran down to the other end. The boats were louder now. There were a lot of them. Bob had some binoculars out. Tina was talking on an emergency radio. She whispered something to Bob.
“I can see the boats!” Raefe yelled. “Over there — there’s a whole fleet of those speed boats, and they’re coming this way.”
“Are we safe?” one of the volunteers yelled. “They’re not thieves or anything are they?’
“No, no,” Bob answered. He looked stunned. “Tina’s been on the radio. Something terrible has happened. Please, everyone, gather round.”
All Raefe could hear was the distant motor boats and his own breathing, which seemed too loud to him. He put his arm around Lina, waiting for Bob to continue. Everyone was here now.
“As you all know, we’ve been off the grid since leaving port this morning around 9. As it turns out, around that time, the largest remaining ice shelf in Antarctica unexpectedly fell into the sea. This is a piece of ice about kilometer thick and about the size of France.”
Several people gasped.
“What does it mean?” Raefe yelled out.
“By itself, it wouldn’t be anything good. But to make matters worse, this ice shelf was apparently holding back hundreds of miles of mainland ice on the continent. Freed of the ice dam in front of them, they are also headed for the Southern Ocean.”
Some people started sobbing.
“Some of you understand what this means. For the rest, I am very sorry to tell you. The ice shelf has spawned an enormous tidal wave, running at around 1,000 kilometers per hour, headed toward the east coast of the United States. Parts of it have already washed over eastern Brazil. The boats you hear are people from all over the Caribbean who were caught out at sea, trying to reach the mainland United States in the hope that they can get far enough inland before the tidal wave hits.”
“What’s going to happen to us?”
“In about an hour, the tidal wave will reach us. It will only be about a meter or two high. Some of it will go around the wall, some of it through the openings in it that would be handling the tidal flow. The wall will be destroyed, all though maybe small pillars of it will survive.”
“How long can we survive out here?” one of the the volunteers asked.
“I’m sorry, I don’t think I’ve made this very clear to you. Minutes after it passes us, the wave will enter shallower waters and it will pile up. By the time it reaches shore, a wall of water 50-80 meters high will hit the East Coast at hundreds of kilometers an hour. Most likely, anyone within 50 clicks of the shore will perish. But by tomorrow, a whole series of even bigger waves will likely reach this area as the main ice streams fall into the Southern Ocean. By this time tomorrow, the Atlantic ocean will have risen permanently by nearly 100 meters. We will not survive that, and even if we did, there will be no one for thousands of miles to come get us.”

            <Notes>Before this, add them working on the tidal power station.

Then they get news of the ice sheet disaster. People have X days before the wave hits. Panic ensues, only so many people can get out.

They’re on the beach hoping for a helicopter when the wave hits.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Far Flier explains the origin of the Guardians</Synopsis>
            <Text>Far Flier watched the last sun fade under the horizon, night leaving only a pale glow on the farthest moon. Far below his ledge, the waters rippled with the breeze, dappling the two moons’ dim reflection. He stood still for a long time, letting his thoughts settle. A lot was on the line tonight.
Something distracted him and he became aware of a mottled hawk perched on a nearby rock, staring at him. Even after a million years of evolutionary divergence, he could understand the look of his distant cousin – she was curious why he was standing, alone, unaware, open to the night. And night  had fully come while he stood thinking. The glowing river of the galaxy’s center now striped the sky above him. Curiosity, it was what had led his kind to these moments.
In a little while, he would reach out with only his enhanced mind and meet hundreds of similar minds across 20 worlds and even more species in that great river. All because a billion years ago, on one of those worlds, someone had been curious about quantum entanglement, a puzzle that had stumped many civilizations. Not so Naw’Ra, who had first grasped that entanglement proved the long-theorized existence of extra-dimensional strings that connected the most fundamental particles of existence. Against all odds, she had proven that the universe was a network of connections that had existed since the big bang. Later searchers would finish her theory, describing the universe as ultimately nothing more than than the broken symmetry of the singularity that had arisen from the vacuum, itself the remnants of the heat death of a truly ancient universe from unknowable trillions of years before. But it was Naw’Ra who had learned to harness the hidden fabric of the universe, and in doing so, change history.
Far Flier turned and entered the cave behind him. Tonight, event his simple apartment would be too full of distractions. He needed total concentration, and the small, remote cave, bare but for a mirror on the far wall, would give him that. He would have to inspire these cadets to change history, or history would eventually wipe out the achievements of Naw’Ra and the many generations of her followers.
He made himself comfortable, and let his mind open. His thoughts merged with the wormhole interface and found the first tendrils of other consciousness. Slowly, he knitted together hundreds of these tendrils, causing them to align and beat like waters lapping the foot of the cliff below. And the waveform emerged from these connections, beating and pulsing with all of their energies.
“Cadets! Welcome to the waveform.” He let them look through his eyes at the cave, feel the air on the tiny vestigial feathers that gave his papery brown head deep purple and red hues. He turned toward the mirror at the far end of the cave so that they could see what he looked like. He felt the waveform relax as he became known to everyone.
“Now we take the first step in your transformation to become Guardians. While you all have practiced this among your own species, on your own worlds, you are now entangled with hundreds of beings from other species in the galaxy. Some of you are over 100 light years from each other, yet we can communicate as if in the same room. This is the first gift of guardianship –– to be able to bridge space and time and share your thoughts and feelings with others.
“You have taken the step to enlist as cadets. You have passed the first reviews and exams, so relax, there will be no test tonight. I do want to ask a question though: What is the purpose of being a Guardian?”
“To save emerging civilizations from self-destruction,” a tall, reedy biped answered.
“To ensure that civilizations that survive do not become threats to other species,” a globular marine creature said. 
“I can feel that most of you agree with these statements,” Far Flier said. “And they are not wrong, But how is it that we can hope to do either of these things, so far from the worlds we affect, only a few thousand Guardians scattered among all of our worlds, where our fellow beings go about their life unconcerned with our work?”
No one answered.
“Ultimately, our work is to connect,” Far Flier said. “To find those, like Naw’Ra, in whom the gift of connection is naturally strong, and to teach them the power of connection. So that they in turn, can connect, not just in the way we are now, but in many profound ways, with their own species. So that their own species can become more deeply interconnected.”
“Most species who destroy themselves already have advanced communications and are more connected than they have ever been,” a cadet answered, her skepticism evident. “How does increasing that connection change things?”
“That, my young cadet, is precisely what you are here to learn. For now, I will point out that anywhere that life has moved beyond the most basic forms, connection is a profound part of evolution. Right now, for example, we are working with a promising species called Humans On their planet, two billion years ago, two kinds of cells — one that make energy from light, and one that  could harness that energy to create many basic compounds, connected and fused and set off an explosion of autotrophic life that has lasted until this moment.”
“But that was blind connection,” protested the young cadet. “No intelligence was involved.”
“You are right, I only wanted to make that point that connection is an ancient and under-appreciated aspect of even the most basic life. To your point, though, as life becomes sentient, it organizes itself into a variety of connections. How many of you live in a society where you are not born into any larger unit — no family, clan, tribe, nation, no connection to anyone outside yourself?”
The waveform was quiet, no ripples disturbing it.
“No one, of course,” Far Flier continued. “But how many of you come from a world where your history was not filled with conflict between individuals, families, clans, tribes and so on? None of you. And it was only when your ancestors, some of them helped by the Guardians, came to understand that connection was more important than conflict that you began to advance. Actually, it was only when your ancestors understood that it was not just the recent connection of family or tribe or nation, but the myriad of connections underlying life itself that were fundamental, that you made progress.”
“Connection is the foundation of all existence, of all life, and as a Guardian, you will experience it as deeply as anyone has, as far as we know, at least in this galaxy. So we will begin with our beginnings, a story you may have heard pieces of, or some not-quite-right version of. Please open your minds fully, and let us go back almost a billion years to the time of the first Guardians, who called themselves the Maw’u’I, the Explorers.
“The Explorers lived in a system with 6 habitable worlds and more than 20 habitable moons, but complex life had arisen on only their world. They were not unlike many of us. They had limbs — six in their case — spoken language, and had been toolmakers for many generations, gradually evolving more and more sophisticated technology. Like most of us, they had arrived at a point where they could destroy their environment, blow themselves up, or find a way forward.”
He let them see U Maw, the Explorer homeworld. Many islands, some so big it would take weeks to walk across, dotted a water sea, like so many living worlds. He took them directly to the middle of the last great battle for U Maw. They watched as one of the larger islands was consumed by the terror of battle. They watched as laser canon fire and sonic canon blasted everything in their path. Lightning sprung from airships, illuminating the faces of the soldiers. He showed them how the carnage went on for days, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage, each side sustaining huge losses. He let them see a satellite view, and they could see smoke clouds filling the atmosphere almost everywhere there was land. They understood that the U Maw was divided into three great alliances, known as Houses, and that they had been locked in mutual combat for many lifetimes.
“It was a war of all against all,” Far Flier injected into the vision. “So often, life comes to this. But the Maw’u’I were lucky. For just before this great war, they had begun exploration of their star system and realized that the other habitable worlds were rich in resources. Life  would have flourished there had it not been erased millions of years ago by a gamma ray burst from a star 6 light years away that had killed off all but the simplest life on all the planets except U Maw. Their world had simply been out of the line of sight of the burst, so they were spared. But here they were, on the verge of self-induced extinction.”
They returned to the vision, watching as Naw’Ra and her allies from all three houses stopped the great battle and entangled with all of the troops, an experience that shattered the soldiers’ will to fight. The cadets all felt the enormity of these battle-hardened people feeling, really feeling, for the first time how little separated them all. And then, with joy, understanding that there was a way to put down their weapons with honor and hope.
“Ending the ceaseless war was only just the beginning,” Far Flier said, drawing the tale to a close. “Naw’Ra remained true to her vision of second chances for life, for intelligence. The schools she founded made deep studies of how intelligence arises in relation to competition and collaboration, how species on one planet can coexist, and many other important questions that had to be answered to prevent a repeat of their history. In the billion years since, we have learned so much about that dance, which every sentient species that is at all social must perform.”
“Are you saying that the Explorers were the first race to survive destroying their own planet and successfully colonizing others?” asked one of the marine species.
“No, not at all. Many species had done that, only to destroy their new planets in time. No, the Maw’u’I were the first to advance down a different road. Their ability to experience deeply each other’s minds led them to understand how important that was. They understood that since they had advanced socially from primitive beings, the balance between what they knew about the world and what they knew about each other had changed radically. They knew so much about transforming the physical world, and so little about how they themselves were being changed by these transformations.”
“They had built great cities and filled them, but had only a passing awareness of what it means to take animals that evolved to live in small bands and put them in a herd of 10 million, all fighting for survival. Now able to truly read each other’s minds, they were shocked to see clearly how distorted and scarred their minds had become. We will delve much more into this later. 
“For now,  it’s enough to understand that the Maw’u’I began a 10,000 year intellectual and emotional trek along this dual path. They probed deeply into themselves, but also into the nature of space and time. How could they meet life from other worlds? How could they ensure that those lifeforms were enlightened enough to not be a threat? This drove two key discoveries. First, they discovered how to entangle across wormholes. This allowed them to transfer their thoughts across light years instantly. 
“For a 1,000 years, this brought them more sadness than joy. They connected with more than a dozen other lifeforms in the galaxy that were sufficiently advanced to receive their communications. But in each case, they were just approaching, just at, or just after the same collision that the Maw’u’I had been at in the time of Naw’Ra. 
“Following her spirit, they looked for another way, and they spent millennia probing what quantum uncertainty really meant. And they made their second great discovery. They learned how to probe other timelines and how to transfer energy through wormholes and entanglement. And now, they could create the Guardians.
“Six hundred years ago, I was a cadet. Like you, I had many questions. What would it feel like to find a new species of intelligent life, to find individuals who had the potential of a Naw’Ra to redirect their species away from ancient and now dangerous directions? How could I watch them fail and would I find the strength to transfer what advances in consciousness they had made to their parallel self in a more favorable timeline? And to watch them fail again, and to persist, with the patience of the Maw’u’I, until they succeeded? What kind of life would this be?””
He paused, life a flyer who has reached his aerie, happy but tired, his breath deep and long. He could feel the cadets anxiety, but also their anticipation. It was a good start.
“It is a life of the greatest joy, and I welcome you to it.”</Text>

            <Title>A dreamy meeting</Title>
            <Synopsis>Diver explains to Raefe who she is and what she is doing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A little while later, the 'cane harvester got off. Their car was almost empty and they dozed on and off. Raefe slipped into a deep sleep, dreaming about being in Rio for Carnival.
There was a long line of odd looking people, sambaing toward him. He danced down the line, shaking each person's hand, asking their name and where they were from. Olaf, the Viking pirate, Norumbega, dives for pearls, on down the line he went until he came to a woman who looked nothing like anyone he had ever met.
She was more than 2 meters tall, but there was something about the way her shoulders, hips and feet formed a long, sinuous arc that was as striking as her height. At first she looked white, but then he realized she had a faint violet glow about her, as if lit from within. She had long black hair, but it too had a faint purplish tinge. And her eyes could only be called fuchsia.
&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked her.
&quot;I'm Diver. I'm glad we are finally getting to meet, Raefe.&quot;
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot;
&quot;I became interested in you some time ago, and I've been learning about you.&quot;
&quot;What? Why would be watching me?&quot;
&quot;Let's go sit over here.&quot; She waved toward a small grove, with a little curved bench big enough for the both of them. There was a slight breeze that kept the trees tilting this way and that in a quiet rustle. Overhead, the sky was blue with tufty cotton clouds. The Carnival music had disappeared.
She sat across from him and laid her hands on top of his. They seemed weightless yet warm. She closed her eyes and without thinking, so did he.
He felt as if the two of them were passing by each other, no more like through each other, as if they each were a school of fish swimming at right angles to each other without touching. Startled, he opened his eyes. She was smiling at him.
&quot;There, now we are more firmly linked,&quot; she said.
&quot;Linked to what?&quot;
&quot;To each other.&quot;
He looked down. She wasn't touching him anymore but he still had that feeling.
&quot;You have many questions and some of the answers will be hard for you to understand or believe. So let me start with the biggest news. I am not human. Nor am I actually here. I live on a planet my kind call Anonto – it means Red Flower in your language –– around a star more than 20 light years from you.&quot;
&quot;And you've travelled here to see me? Why&quot;
&quot;No, I have not travelled to your world. It would take many lifetimes to travel to your world. But like many other intelligent species, after thousands of years of watching the stars and trying to understand the universe, we have found ways to send signals vast distances through shortcuts in the universe. You call them wormholes. Unlike some of your more imaginative entertainment, living things, nor any other objects of any size, cannot go through wormholes. But energy – information --  can.&quot;
&quot;So, you're just some kind of holo vid?&quot;
&quot;Not exactly. Perhaps you will take a course in your school that goes deeper into physics and it will become easier for you to understand. But the basic idea is that when the big bang happened, what was once a mass of energy, all interacting in a single waveform, flew outward and cooled and separated into the universe we see. But subtle connections remain between matter that once was connected, subtle pathways for waves to form. Your physicists call this quantum entanglement, although they are far from understanding how it works. We have learned how to travel those pathways and strengthen them, even across wormholes. So right now, my brain and your brain are having a conversation over these many light years because we are entangled with each other.&quot;
&quot;How did this happen? Did someone plant a chip in me?&quot;
She smiled. &quot;No, you have a great gift. All living things sense entanglement to some degree – we all have atoms and even smaller particles that condensed out of the primordial bang and this creates a very low level field that we mostly aren't aware of. You and I, and many, many others, somehow concentrate this entanglement more than our fellow beings. We are not sure why or how. But we know it's true and have been meeting living creatures throughout the galaxy this way for thousands of years. And before us, for more than a billion years, other creatures have been doing the same.&quot;
&quot;I don't know what to say. I don't feel particularly special. I'm just a kid who gets headaches, sometimes daydreams too much, and is struggling to get through college. Sometimes I feel like I want to do something big, but I don't think even I believe that I will, and I know no one else does. I'm one of those people other people say ''nice guy, not too ambitious, a little dreamy' about.&quot;
&quot;Your headaches and daydreams are a symptom of your gift, and of your inability to channel it. I will help you with that in time. As for the rest, I think you are going to do big things.&quot;
Raefe felt like a guitar string that had been plucked and couldn't stop vibrating. Her words were like a song playing in his head. Did she feel his thoughts in the same way?
&quot;Yes, that's exactly it,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I do feel your thoughts that way. In time, it will seem unremarkable to you and you will begin to notice that from other people in your world, too. But now I have to tell you some hard things, and ask your help.
&quot;There is a loose association of advanced lifeforms called Guardians who speak to each other across these wormhole links. I am one of them. I am working to nurse your species through its most dangerous epoch. You see it all around you – your species has developed great destructive power. You could wipe yourself out in a day with nuclear weapons. Right now, you are wiping yourselves out with a slower destruction of your environment. You have learned a great deal about the natural world, and can manipulate it for both productive and destructive purposes. Yet you know very little, yet, about yourselves. About how your own minds work, and how to steer them to avoid these calamities.&quot;
&quot;Wow, you can say that again. That's all we seem to do – mess things up and then talk about why and how. But we never seem to change much. What can we do?&quot;
&quot;I can't tell you that. Both because I don't know – every species must find its own way – and because Guardians have learned the hard way that accelerating your development through giving you extensive knowledge of discoveries you are millennia from reaching on your own never works. Ultimately, your knowledge of yourselves and the physical universe must develop in a new way, in a more linked way, which you will have to find on your own.&quot;&quot;
&quot;Seems kind of creepy, like you want me to join some kind of sleeper cell for aliens.&quot;
&quot;You will have to judge our motives and actions for yourself. But my goals isn't to have you carry out some plot. These People who are entanglers, they connect with other People in different ways. They sense different parts of what ultimately will be a solution for your species. My only goal is to connect you with each other, so that you can begin that work yourself.
&quot;Can I tell anyone about you?&quot;
&quot;I would advise against it. I think you understand on a very basic level that if you discuss this with others, the issue will become your sanity, not the substance of what it is to be done. For others, the narrative will come too close to religion, and they will become passive, thinking that the Guardians will save them as some kind of gods. In billions of years, intelligent life has never found gods. If they exist, they hide well. Although we also still cannot explain some aspects of how the universe works, gods have little to do in our worldview. So you should probably think of me as a muse, a source of inspiration, that you meet in dreams.&quot;
&quot;Ah, so this is a dream?&quot;
&quot;Yes, for now, that is how we will meet. But you will remember all of it. And now, I will show you how to deal with those headaches.&quot;
He felt a warmth, as if a tiny river of honey was flowing from one part of his head (or was it just his mind) to another. He understood that he could turn that flow on next time he felt that migraine-like headache, and it would soothe it. He smiled. This was going to be alright.

            <Notes>The man ignored him and turned to the passengers. “Allow me to introduce ourselves. I’m Alton Winchester, and we are the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We came to defend Richmond from the coal companies. They want to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia. They need that water to turn that coal into chemicals they can sell. The corpos tell these boys a fairy tale about how they’re saving the country, but that’s what this is about. We got word that this train was under attack and we hurried over here.”</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Raefe is in a coma,but his mind can now reach out.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was dark, but he could sense most of the people in the encampment, like small candles through heavy fog. Some sputtered with fear, some burned hot with anger, many flickered dully. Ah, there was Davis. Raefe had suspected that he was a tangler and now he could feel a weak connection. Davis didn’t notice. Raefe would deal with him later.
Now he wanted to find Lina. He searched the camp. There! He started to run to her and realized that he couldn’t move. His eyes were closed. He seemed to be lying down. Was he dreaming? Unconscious? He felt panic rising through him.
He calmed himself, trying to read her energy. She was hurt, but he couldn’t tell how badly. She needed help and he needed to figure out how to help her. He shut out all of the other minds, letting hers fill more and more of his awareness. She was in a tent with two other women. They were awake, talking quietly. He felt Lina tense as one of the other women poked at a wound on her face. Changing a dressing, that’s what she was doing. He didn’t know how he could know this, but he knew it, as if he was blind and Lina was telling him what she was seeing, only she was telling him silently.
He let his mind spread farther and deeper, wrapping himself around her. He could feel where he would tangle with her, if she could. He remembered being touched there by Diver, the feeling of having her mind pass through his without actually touching him. Schools of fish, that was how it had felt. He thought of one of the reefs in Miami, and pictured himself a school of silver jackfish and Lina a school of blue parrotfish. He felt himself glide through her, the mental tendrils of his school brushing past her many small tendrils.
It worked! He could feel her thoughts now, swim among them, feel the currents she created as if she, too was swimming through him. It wasn’t easy, though, and he forced himself to be patient, to let her currents wash over him, and let his mind feel them and understand what they meant.
He could feel time passing, but had no idea of how much. Slowly, discrete memories and thoughts assembled themselves. She was hurt, but she was breathing OK. She could walk. She was full of rage and fear. He had been hit with the rifle butt and knocked unconscious. Shit, that had been two days ago. She thought he was in a coma, she was deeply concerned about him, her thoughts cycling like a hamster on a wheel, building up momentum.
He sunk into more memories and was horrified.  While he had been lying here, she had been beaten and then raped. He had to help her but how? He untangled from her. He couldn’t control his mind anymore, do this delicate dance. He let his thoughts scream, he felt like a thousand watts of angry electric guitar, wailing into the night air.</Text>

            <Title>New plot summary</Title>
            <Text>Raefe and Lina take the train back. The Snakeheads attack the train as part of their assault on Richmond. The snow sooners resist, a fight ensues, people are shot, they surrender.
Raefe and Lina are taken to a prisoner camp in the Virginia hills. Lina tells him about her rape — this whole thing is a bit of a flashback for her. It’s clear nothing good is going to happen to Lina here. Raefe feels hopeful, he’s not sure why, he focuses on that. Unknowingly, it helps Alton find him. This is all about the power of empathy.
The NVA is a small group inspired by a very big group of the same name in Nigeria. There, they are a group trying to rebuild West Africa after combined eco disasters (oil spills) and decades of either corrupt government or Boko Haram. The NVA in the US has come to Richmond because the same corpos are behind attacks on the NVA in West Africa and the Snakeheads in the US — Mobil Gulf and their subsidiary, United Energy Resources, the last of the Kochs. In W. Africa, they are fronting a new “moderate Sharia” movement that seeks to keep the conservative view of Islam in power, essentially the same partnership between oil companies and Gulf monarchs that has always been.
Renegades are ecstatic — Jeff Davis is their secret weapon.
NVA rescues them. Raefe makes mental contact with Alton — he recreates the feeling Diver had with him. He tells Alton some of what he is about. They agree to meet soon.
Diver visits him again and congratulates him on his emerging skills. She helps him understand what empathy is, and the potential social power in it.
They get back to Somerville. Kiki (K&amp;K Deli) is squatting in their Tiny. Kayam has been arrested on trumped up charges because developers want to build in their neighborhood. She is homeless. They let her stay.
Raefe is visited by the Feds. He thinks they want to know about the Snakeheads, but really they want to know about the NVA.He finds he is able to learn much about them just by watching and listening — he is becoming very astute at reading people, again, sort of an enhanced empathy.
Raefe has missed so much school he has to drop out. He visits his parents to tell them.
Renegades are now quite upset that Raefe bested their guy.
At this point, Raefe and Lina have to embark on some course of action. Diver has to visit Raefe again. TBD.

            <Text>Chapter 6
A little while later, the ‘cane harvester got off. Their car was almost empty and they dozed off for awhile. Raefe slept dreamless and deep, woke as the train came to a sudden halt. His Voice chirped and announced that the train had stopped due to routine maintenance on the track ahead. Wow, he thought, when did the train company start paying for maintenance? Usually they just waited for a break down and then fixed it.
Lina looked like she had been awake for awhile.
“Where are we?”
“Near Richmond, I think,” she said. “But something’s up. Look out the window, to your right.”
There was smoke up ahead, black rolling clouds. Something big was burning, maybe only a kilometer away. They went between the cars, trying to look out, but the smoke was thick up ahead and they couldn’t see past it. He ask his Voice for news about Richmond.
“There are 781 reports of fire, fighting and police activity. How should I focus?” the Voice wanted to know.
“Fighting,” he replied, now getting nervous. Occasionally thieves boarded the high-speed luxury trains, but who would want to jack a solar train? He and Lina had nothing to steal anyway.
“Reports from citizens on local sites say about 200 armed men have attempted to take over Richmond City Hall. These reports are unconfirmed by police or other official sources.”
“What is the government here?” Raefe asked. “Any chance police will come?”
“Difficult to determine,” the Voice answered. “Nominally, still part of Virginia and the United States, but that doesn’t count for much. Richmond is sandwiched between two semi-autonomous corporate tax-free zones — Brightstar Defense to the north, and United Energy Resources to the west — who both want to absorb Richmond, but so far haven’t made much progress.”
Now he was scared. Two hundred armed men? That was beyond a trainjack crew — was this some kind of corporate powerplay they were caught up in?
“Raefe, we should go,” Lina said, her fear palpable.
“Go where?”
“I don’t know, we should find a place to hide. They may board the train.”
“Or maybe they don’t give a soot about the train and we’ll just be making it harder on ourselves. What do we do if the train takes off while we’’re hiding?”
Before she could answer, a gunshot went off close by. The car door burst open and half a dozen men burst in, military guns but ragtag uniforms. Brightstar mercs? he wondered.
“Listen up,” announced a scrawny white man, almost a boy, at the front of the group.  “Richmond, Virginia has been liberated by the Snakehead Militia, fighting for the United States of White America. You are riding a solar train, which is forbidden in our territory. You will be escorted off the train, and taken by truck to a station on the other side of Richmond. In three days, we will repair the tracks and have re-established diesel service and you can catch a fuel train to wherever you are going. If Richmond is your final destination, you are not far. We will put you on the nearest street and you can start walking.”
“Shit, they’re  real, the Confeds,” Raefe whispered.
“We need to get out of here, if we can,” Lina said, trying not to move her mouth. Raefe could feel the sweat on her palms. Just how racist were they? There was plenty of rumors on the net about the Confeds. Wacked out Wyn heads, outlaw diesel bikers, mercs who hadn’t had a job since they were run out of Mexico, the nets couldn’t agree on who these guys were. Except, they were white, as in White.
The platoon herded them off the train and made them line up along the narrow corridor that separated a small forest from the tracks. There were closer to 50 than the 200 reported with the usual net exaggeration. Up close, they looked more sick than dangerous. Pale skin and thinning hair, looking old even at 19 or 20. The water in the coal fields was mostly polluted, it was a heavy metal gruel that slowly sapped the strength of those who drank it, weakening even their genes. They were the last of the last in that part of the country, held there by fear, family ties, crooked preachers and lying corpos long after the land gave up on them.
He could see one of them was the leader. He seemed to have a little spark about him, a luminescence that shone through the dirty pale skin and the greasy hair. He had a T-shirt with a faded picture of a group of bearded men in 19th century clothes, and the words, “Like my brother below me, I took a rebel stand.” He had a nanotat circling his neck. It was off, but Raefe could make out different geometric patterns. 
“What you looking at, white boy?” the Confed said. He shook his head quickly and the tats woke up. Red and black symbols — maybe it was the Confederate flag with Nazi swastikas added to it — orbited his neck. “You’’re in White America, now. What once was lost, now is found – you’re looking at the real symbols of your country.”
Raefe didn’t know if he was joking or insane. Still, he could feel the energy of this kid. Best not to test him. He would have to be careful talking with him.
“See, it hurts me to see a white man scared to see the symbols of his own heritage, and taking comfort with lesser creatures. I told you not to worry, we ain’t gonna hurt you. But your girl friend, she’s going to have to come with me.”
“Go with you where?” Lesser creatures? What planet was this guy on?
“I told you, you in White America now. Everyone else, we got a camp for them on the edge of town. We give ‘em three squares and a cot, not to worry, and send them back to where they came from as soon as we can. We’re good Christians. We keep God’s laws here – and the Children of Ham, we got to help them see their place in God’s plan, you know?”
“I’m standing right here, Mr. White America,” Lina spat out. “You can kill me right the frick here, you pale-skinned, soot-brained son of a goat, if you think I’d go anywhere with you but to your funeral. I know exactly what ‘come with you’ means. I seen that vid already and I don’t care what the frick color you are, I ain’t going nowhere with you.”
“Damn straight!” another woman in the crowd yelled out. People started shouting, and the small band of soldiers was looking nervous, wondering what to do next.  Raefe could feel a small lightning ball growing inside this kid, not sure whether to strike to ground or not.
“What’s your name?” he asked him.
“People call me Jeff Davis,” he replied.
“But that’s not your name is it? He was an original Confederate, I know that. What does your mother call you?”
“Why you care?”
“We got a situation here. I’m trying to figure out where we go from here, and I’d like to know who I’m talking to.”
“Jeff Davis will do for you. The situation we got is that y’all got to do as you’re told, or someone is going to get hurt.””
“Is that what you want? I don’t know what they told you back there in coal country, but people who take the solar train, we’re all poor. These people been through a lot – hurricanes, tidal waves, civil wars and just plain scuffling to survive.  I see you have, too, so I’m going to tell you straight. A lot of these people have faced worse than you, and whatever power you think you have over them, they are going to make you use it.”
Just then, a shot rang out about 30 meters down the track.  A group of passengers had surrounded one of the Snakehead platoons, and one of the soldiers had fired a warning shot in the air. Jeff Davis motioned and he and his men ran toward the shot. Raefe and Lina took the opportunity to melt back into the crowd, which had now swelled into one mass of all the passengers faced off with all of the Snakeheads.
Davis pushed his way to the front. “Everybody calm the frick down. No need for you to be causing trouble here, we’ve explained to you we’ll be processing you shortly.”
“Process my ass, you little shit,” shouted a small, wirey, grizzled older white guy in the front of the passenger’s group. “Who the frick you think you are, you Wyn-loser little sootface? We paid good money to take this train up North so’s we can work and send money back to our families. Most of us looking to catch on with snow crews. Most of us need to be in Hartford, Connecticut bright and early tomorrow for the big New England snow remover shape up or we won’t get on any of the crews. We ain’t got time for your backwoods shit. Now git the frick out of our way.”
More than 50 of the passengers had closed ranks behind him. Some of them had knives, some of them had found pieces of wood or had rocks in their hands.
Davis’ crew looked nervous, but he was standing calm, almost bored. “We regret any inconvenience you may experience, but you are in our country now, and the law is the law. White folks, please walk to the head of the train and board the transportation to your train. Everyone else, you’’ll be enjoying the hospitality of White America for a night, and then we’ll get you on back to where you came from.”
A young black woman and two brownish men of indeterminate ethnicity joined the older white guy at the front. They all had some kind of weapon.
“Shake that coal dust out of your ears,” the woman said. “You must not be hearing us. You do not want to mess with snow ‘sooner crews.  This is life or death for us – our only hope of making it through the winter. We work for months for this fare – salvage, nuclear reactor disassembly, solar furnace repair, whatever shit job you can think of, we’ve been doing it.”
“Lady’s right,” one of the brown men said. “We don’t catch on with a crew tomorrow, our families may not eat. Hell, we may not eat. This ain’t no sim – next time one of you fires a gun, in the air or not, these folks probably just rush right at you and beat you silly before you get those rifles up.”
“Gentleman, I can appreciate the difficulties of living in the sad remainders of the United States of America,” Davis said. “Until we can re-establish the rule of Christian law, God will not grace any of us with a decent life. You are paying for the sins of generations that ignored His teachings and broke with his ways.”
“Listen, boy,” the white man said, “Last I heard, you can still preach that shit on the net somewhere. That’s your play here. Not only are we not going to stand for you messing with our work, but we ain’t going to let you split us up. I might be nothing better than a snow ‘sooner monkey, and I might have only gone to school long enough to learn to read and use the Net, but I ain’t ignorant enough to believe all that White America crap. Besides, you start splitting us up like that, you’re splitting families, best friends, and whole work crews. So step off.”
“I’m trying to get you to see that there’s a new order here,” Davis said. “And a new law, and a new law is the first step we have to take.” He nodded at the boys behind him, and they all came to shooting position. “Now I’’m going to count to ten, and you all are going to turn and march to the front of the train. White people straight ahead, everyone else, you’ll see a path to the left.”
Suddenly the forest along the tracks rustled and several dozen men emerged, rifles pointed at the Snakeheads. They were mostly dark-skinned, as rag tag looking as the Confeds. They all wore black and yellow knit caps. A small tobacco-colored middle-aged man walked up to Davis.
“Son, I believe that one day you will look back on this day and understand it was the beginning of a wiser life for you. And I sincerely hope that you live to see that day, despite your own intentions. And the first step on that road is for you and all your boys to point your rifles at the ground and walk away.”
“No sir. I don’t take no orders from no niggers.”
“My name is Alton Winchester,” the man said. “The rest of your friends in Richmond are gone. The locals drove them out, the fires are under control, the track is already repaired. I know you came here to steal water, but you can’t just take water from other people because you’ve ruined yours. I know you’ll figure that out eventually, but for today, just turn around. Living in that cancer pit you call home, death will find you soon enough. We ain’t about hurrying it along.”
Jeff Davis stared at Winchester. Raefe could almost feel the static electricity between them. But Winchester was having none of it. He returned Davis’ stare with a bemused glance.
“White America will rise again, make no mistake about it,” Davis snarled, as he waved his outmanned group back toward Richmond. “There’’s more where we came from, and not just in the coal fields.”
All the passengers watched them march off, not trusting them. Raefe noticed the New Voodo Army guys all had their rifles down, but their fingers near the trigger. Finally, they heard the unusual sound of a pack of diesel trucks in the distance and figured Davis and his men were headed away.
Raefe embraced Lina. In the two years they had been together, her color had never drawn this kind of fire. He knew it was out there, but coming face to face with it shook him.
“Are you OK?” he asked. She embraced him.
“Yeah, I’m OK. You?” Lina said. She could feel him shaking.
“I guess. No, not really. I know my life hasn’t been like yours, but I never thought of myself as being sheltered. I mean, I’ve been robbed, beat up, met my share of sketchy characters…”
“But you never had a gun pointed at you, for real?” she said.
“Exactly, and that what were they going to do with you?  I thought that stuff died out in the ‘20s, after the Feds put down the white militas.”
“That shit is like mold in the refrigerator. You don’t keep cleaning out rotten stuff, it comes right back.”
“Do you get that shit at home?” Raefe asked. “Do I just not see it?”
“Not much,” she smiled. “But yeah, sometimes. You know your friend Herbert? You ever notice how if he comes over when I’m not around, and then I come in, he leaves pretty quick?”
“No, not really. You think he’s a racist?”
“Yeah, he has two looks he gives me. One, is disgust. The other, he wants to jump my bones and then he’s disgusted with himself that he feels that way about me.”
“Lina, you hardly know the guy.”
“Authentic. But I know those looks, trust me. It’s OK — most of your friends are cool and up where we live, I don’t wake up in fear every day. And you’re right, these Snakeheads would get laughed out of anywhere within 300 kilometers of where we live. Still, I do know the smell of mold.” 
“OK, then, frickin’ Herbert is gone,” Raefe answered, wondering what else was out there below his eyeline. “Let’s go find Winchester.”  
“Que massa, that bird,” Lina replied. “He’s over there.””
Winchester was standing up on a little ridge, eyeing the forest to make sure no one was coming back. Raefe gave him a hug. “I think you just saved our lives.”
Lina hugged him next. “I was ready to die. I kind of lost my mind. First, this paleface starts spewing all this racist yak at me. He was so over the top, I thought I was watching some old vid. Then, the guns, the talk about the camp, I was back in Efricar, in some very bad memories. I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t shown up.”
“We watched from the trees,” Alton said. “We know they don’t have a camp anywhere to take people to, and we weren’t going to find out what they were really up to. We hear maybe they think dark-skinned people are just right to work in uranium mines out west, and they got some kind of deal to ship them out there. Not sure. Just for the record, too, they would have taken everything the white people owned before letting them go. But your snow ‘sooner monkeys shocked them, and I didn’t want to see how that was going to play out. So we moved in.”
“Why were you here in the first place?” Lina asked.
“We’re the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We keep an eye on the Confeds and about a half dozen other racist militia groups.”
“A half a dozen? Is that what you do, scare the scary guys?” Raefe asked. 
“Nah, that just comes with the territory. We’re about surviving the apocalypse.”
“You think there’s going to be an apocalypse?” Raefe asked.
“Going to be? Already been one – didn’t you notice? We’re all in the middle of it. We’re not Christian crazies, we’re not waiting for the heavens to open and God to strike all the sinners dead. The sinners will strike the rest of us dead, we don’t watch out. Like the White America kids, they’re half dead already and they don’t even want to admit it. They let the corpos get over on them, telling them how God wants them to rescue America from the Children of Ham. Robby Koch is who wants them to rescue America, and for United Energy Resources, not God.”
“Robby Koch? The billionaire?”
“More like the son of billionaires. They bet on the wrong horse, three generations of them spending all their money trying to stop what can’t be stopped. He bought the old Biltmore place in North Carolina, put laser turrets all around it, and spend half of what he’s got left trying to start his own country, White America. Coal’s been contraband for 20 years, he’s still selling it to those kids’ families for heating and cooking, telling them God made coal, and coal made America. Meanwhile, his mines and oil refineries and whatnot have poisoned everything in Appalachia.”
“Why did they wander all the way east here, out of the coalfields,” Lina asked.
“They’ve got some insane plan to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia,” Windhester said. “They need that water to turn that coal into chemicals they can sell. The corpos tell these boys a fairy tale about how they’re saving the country, but that’s what this is about. We got word that this train was under attack and we hurried over here.”
“So what’s the NVA’s track?” Lina asked.
“We’re about helping people to understand what’s going on, and what we need to do, and why they should have hope.”
“Every group of six students on our campus says that,” Lina. “Whenever I ask them what that means, they start stuttering.”
“Well, what do you expect? Sister, there is no God, there’s only us, and we have to figure it out. Took a long time to make this mess, and we only got decades to turn it around or we’ll be living like cave men for the next ten centuries.”
“So what’s the voodoo all about?” Raefe wondered.
“That’s a long story, but I’ll give you the short version. In Africa, before white people conquered it, Voodo was a whole system of belief –– science, ethics, harmony with nature, music, spirituality. It was a way to pass knowledge and to practice righteousness, together, as a community. We’re adapting it to the 21st Century. We need a new way of thinking and being, and we can’t depend on the usual means to spread it. So we use the music and dance to spread knowledge.”
Just then the train whistle blew. The snow ‘sooner gang had made sure the train crew got right to it. 
“I have to know more about this. Why the army? What else are you doing?” he asked Alton.
“You come visit me. Sometime I feel an openness from people, a hunger. You’ve got that.”
Eerily, exactly what he had felt in Alton.
“I’ll do it. Where do I find you?”
“We’re on the road for a while,” he smiled, like they were some Afro-Braz band on the last half of their world tour. “After the monsoons, you go to South Staten Island, all the way to the south shore past the old Arthur Kill dumps. You can experience life, Voodo style. You get lost, ask around, everyone knows me. But take these.”
He pulled out two black and yellow watch caps, and gave them to Raefe and Lina.
“You wear them when you come to see me — think of like a security key. Until then, maybe you keep them to yourselves,” he smiled. “We’re not a style -- we like people representing us to actually know what we believe.”</Text>
            <Notes>The man ignored him and turned to the passengers. “Allow me to introduce ourselves. I’m Alton Winchester, and we are the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We came to defend Richmond from the coal companies. They want to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia.

“Stop fidgeting, please,” Lina said. “Since we’ve been back on the train, you haven’t sat still for 5 minutes. You could have walked from Richmond to Philly, as much as you sat down.”
“Sorry,” he said. “I felt sick, I guess from all that adrenaline. But my mind’s going a million clicks an hour.”
“Me too. It’s been quite a day.”
“It didn’t start out that way. We had a nice time in Miami, we did some good building the power station. In my dream, you had this look on your face. Everything’s going to be alright it said. We’re going to make it so. I wish I saw that on you now.”
“You told me I said that you were going to make it alright.”
“You did, it’s true, but it felt like you meant we were going to do it together.”
“I like you Raefe, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”
Raefe stared out at New Jersey going by, the abandoned refineries, the far edges of the New York metropolis just beginning. He hadn’t meant anything romantic by his comment, which didn’t stop Lina’s remark from stinging him.
“I didn’t mean it that way, no offense. The ‘we” was, I don’t know, young people, people on the losing end, really, whoever fits that ‘we.’ And after today, getting ahead of ourselves is exactly what I want to do. How can a moron like that threaten so many ordinary people, just because he’s what, white, American, Christian.  I’m pissed off — I guess after fear comes rage.”
“Authentic, I’ve been there. But here we were, trying to do good. What else are we supposed to do?”
“Whenever we — me, you, whomever, say that, we really mean ‘I can’t do anything about it.’ But I really feel like answering the question — what are we supposed to do?”
“People been asking that for a long time.”
“I know. Did I ever tell you about my Aunt Layla?”
“No, who’s she?”
“My grandmother’s cousin, but we called her Aunt. She’s in her seventies. She’s a pistol, my mom says she always was. She graduated high school, class of 2000, the original millennial. She remembers a lot about that time, and what her people told her about the time before that. It’s not what we were told. They weren’t just the people who used up the planet and streamed each other cat videos while it happened.”
“What were they?”
“She told me that her generation was the first generation of the Slide. Even her older sister expected that each generation would have it better than the one before. They had wars and racism and all that, but it seemed like it was always getting a little better. No one was prepared when it started seriously going the other way, even though they had kind of griped about it before it actually happened. They were all in shock.”
“Every pig eventually finds the trough is empty.”
“I know, that’s the way we look at them. But her parents, and their parents, plenty of them saw how wrong it was. They tried to sound the alarm, they tried to change things. They just didn’t know how. And the corpos already had their fingers in the government and the schools and that didn’t exactly make for intellectual clarity.”
“So nothing’s changed,” she declared, case closed.
“Not my point. I know it was just a dream what you said, but it’s running around in my head all day. Why aren’t we trying? I don’t mean you and me, I mean all of us. Well, most of us. How many people do you know are as evil as the people who ruined your dad’s life, or who totally stopped any attempt to keep the ice caps from melting?“
“Authentic! You know I hate that shit, too – why do I have to hoard carbs ‘cause some corpo bastard spewed soot everywhere for centuries. Everyone contributed, but everyone wasn’t equally to blame, everyone shouldn’t be equally to shame. “
“That’s just some crap they feed us on the ‘net,” he said. ““My aunt say that had already started when she was our age, all these corpos rigging it so we have to pay their freight.”
“Maybe your aunt was just some white chick who found out how the rest of world was living all along.”
 “You know, she said the same thing. That’s what I mean – they were actually wrestling with all of this shit, not just narking out on vids. Anyway, a rising tide floods all coasts, as they say. Everybody acts like we reached Level 17 of some really sooty sim, and we just have to find the magic charm and it will be OK. So far, it’s not OK.What about the future? Are we just going to root around in the marshes for good junk for generations?” 
“Are you serious about this? Or is this just end of vacation blues? I like your vapor, but I really don’t see how anyone can untangle this mess.”
“What about what Alton said — we all have to figure that out?”
“You know the Chinese thought they had it all figured out 100 years ago. Look how that turned out. Shit, America was God’s gift to the world 300 years ago and now it’s mostly in the toilet. Whenever someone’s in my face talking big ideas, I turn around and make sure there’s no one behind stealing my wallet.”
Raefe laughed. Lina was nobody’s fool.
“Ok, ok, I get your point. But lately, I feel like something’s brewing. You’re not the only person who doesn’t listen to all that crap. Practically nobody does, it seems. And they seem fine for it. Look at our neighborhood — everyone in the world lives there. Nobody’s pulling shit like that Davis kid. Everyone likes that you can eat different kinds of food every meal, and hear different music, and you can travel around the world just by talking to people in a coffee shop.”
“I don’t think we’re really having an argument,” Lina said. “I feel that way, too, a lot of times. But the man who did this to me,” she touched her scar, “he looked just like me but he still held a knife to my head and raped me. And marked me so everyone would know. And you know why he did it? Because he got paid by the Chinese, with all their fine talk about making our lives better, like $5 to terrorize our village and that included raping a 10-year old girl. So you’ll forgive my skepticism.”
He didn’t know whether to hug her or hold her hand or say sorry or say nothing.
“Oh, fuck, I’m so sorry. But you know what -- I trust you, Lina. I trust that you would never become that person just for revenge, that you wouldn’t do unto others as they have done to you. You would want to make the world better, not worse.”
“I might want to kill that motherfucker, but not just for revenge, you’re right. And I love that about you, that you always move toward the light. I just don’t always know where the light is, except the other way from the dark.”
 “I need to find that out. After this trip, I can’t just study for tests and hope that I get a not too terrible office serf job and we can afford side by side Tinies. It’s time for me to start poking my head out of the cave and seeing what’s out there.  I can’t quite believe that 200,000 years of evolution and 10,000 years of civilization can only end in a long slide to oblivion.” </Text>

            <Synopsis>Diver reveals herself to Raefe</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 9

Raefe stared out of the window at the snow, falling for the third straight day. The morning blizzard had eased up to a light fall as the backside of the storm circled through. They’d get a few hours of sun now before the ‘soon swirled back fresh with frozen moisture from the ocean.
He thought of the snow crew on the train ride, probably exhausted after the last three weeks of this, lying alongside a road somewhere, trying to catch a little nap before the next storm wave hit. They’d work almost around the clock for the snow ‘soon season, piling up as much money as they could. Then they’d head on to the next migrant jobs they could find. What a life!
He read a class assignment with no particular enthusiasm. He remembered a character in an old vid saying “I’m putting this town in my rear view,” and that’’s what where his classes seemed focused on. It was interesting, in an abstract sort of way. But everything was different now, and would be different tomorrow. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if the people of the past had that much to offer, why was he living through mass extinctions, endless wars around the world, corpos corrupting every government to their own ends, and the possibility of total disaster looming?
But if he flunked out of Human Potential 221, he’d be in danger of losing his scholarship. And if he lost that, he’d be out on the street, and then he’d become a snow monkey or something equally undesirable. There was always something worse, he was discovering.
He turned back to his screen, trying to focus on this rather abstruse lecture on “Cooperation versus competition in pre-electronic societies.” He listened for the third time, trying to understand what was really different about back then, trying to picture a world where you mostly had to be face to face with people to see what they really looked like and sounded like. Was there any type of person on earth he had not seen or heard on the ‘net? He tried to imagine different variables – tallest, shortest, fattest, thinnest, palest, darkest, hair, eyes –– what a motley bunch we all were. He turned up the Carnival music coming out of Rio on the Net and closed his eyes and tried to picture them. 
There was a long line of odd looking people, sambaing toward him. He danced down the line, shaking each person’s hand, asking their name and where they were from. Olaf, the Viking pirate, Norumbega, dives for pearls, on down the line he went until he came to a woman who looked nothing like anyone he had ever met.
She was more than 2 meters tall, but there was something about the way her shoulders, hips and feet formed a long, sinuous arce that was as striking as her height. At first she looked white, but then he realized she had a faint violet glow about her, as if lit from within. She had long black hair, but it too had a faint purplish tinge. And her eyes could only be called fuchsia.
“Who are you,” he asked her.
“I’m Diver. I’m glad we are finally getting to meet, Raefe.”
“How do you know my name?”
“I became interested in you some time ago, and I’ve been learning about you.”
“What? Why would be watching me?”
“I’m going to tell you that. Let’s go sit over here.” She waved toward a small grove, with a little curved bench big enough for the both of them. There was a slight breeze that kept the trees tilting this way and that in a quiet rustle. Overhead, the sky was blue with tufty cotton clouds. The Carnival music had disappeared.
She sat across from him and laid her hands on top of his. They seemed weightless yet warm. She closed her eyes and without thinking, so did he.
A second went by and then he felt a sensation that he had never felt before, as if the two of them were passing by each other, no more like through each other, as if they each were a school of fish swimming at right angles to each other without touching. Startled, he opened his eyes. She was smiling at him.
“There, now we are more firmly linked,” she said.
“Linked to what?”
“To each other.”
He looked down. She wasn’t touching him anymore but he still had that feeling.
“You have many questions and some of the answers will be hard for you to understand or believe. So let me start with the biggest news. My name is Diver, as I said, but I am not human. Nor am I actually here. I live on a planet my kind call A’Nonto – it means Red Flower in your language –– around a star more than 20 light years from you.”
“And you’ve travelled here to see me? Why”
“No, I have not travelled to your world. It would take many lifetimes to travel to your world. But like many other intelligent species, after thousands of years of watching the stars and trying to understand the universe, we have found ways to send signals vast distances through shortcuts in the universe. I believe in your culture, these are called wormholes. Unlike some of your more imaginative entertainment, living things, nor any other objects of any size, cannot go through wormholes. But energy – information --  can.”
“So, you’re just some kind of holo vid?”
“Not exactly. Perhaps you will take a course in your school that goes deeper into physics and it will become easier for you to understand. But the basic idea is that when the big bang happened, what was once a mass of energy, all interacting in a single waveform, flew outward and cooled and separated into the universe we see. But subtle connections remain between matter that once was connected, subtle pathways for waves to form. Your physicists call this quantum entanglement, although they are far from understanding how it works. We have learned how to travel those pathways and strengthen them, even across wormholes. So right now, my brain and your brain are having a conversation over these many light years because we are entangled with each other.”
“How did this happen? Did someone plant a chip in me?”
She smiled. “No, you have a great gift. All living things sense entanglement to some degree – we all have atoms and even smaller particles that condensed out of the primordial bang and this creates a very low level field that we mostly aren’t aware of. You and I, and many, many others, are creatures who somehow concentrate this entanglement more than our fellow beings. We are not sure why or how. But we know it’s true and have been meeting living creatures throughout the galaxy this way for thousands of years. And before us, for more than a billion years, other creatures have been doing the same.”
“I don’t know what to say. I don’t feel particularly special. I’m just a kid who gets headaches, sometimes daydreams too much, and is struggling to get through college. Sometimes I feel like I want to do something big, but I don’t think even I believe that I will, and I know no one else does. I’m one of those people other people say ‘‘nice guy, not too ambitious, a little dreamy’ about.”
“Your headaches and daydreams are a symptom of your gift, and of your inability to channel it. I will help you with that in time. As for the rest, I think you are going to do big things.”
Raefe felt like a guitar string that had been plucked and couldn’t stop vibrating. Her words were like a song playing in his head. Did she feel his thoughts in the same way?
“Yes, that’s exactly it,” she smiled. “I do feel your thoughts that way. In time, it will seem unremarkable to you and you will begin to notice that from other people in your world, too.”
“Maybe I have already. Sometimes I meet someone and I have this vague sense of a kind of static electricity between us.”
“Excellent! You are on your way.”
“To what?”
“Now I have to tell you some hard things, and ask your help.”
For the first time, he felt fear. He looked around. They were in this little woods, all alone. There were no buildings on the horizon. Where was he? Could he leave if he wanted?
“You can relax, Raefe. You are asleep. When you wake up, you will remember this, and you will be free to do whatever you want. For now, let me explain some things. Is that OK?”
“Yes, I want to hear what you have to say. Or think, or whatever it is we are doing.”
“Your scientists have made great strides in the last few generations and found many planets outside your star system, including some that they think might have life. Including, actually, my planet, but that’s a story for another day. My species discovered these things about 10,000 years ago and for many generations, we made plans to roam the galaxy to look for intelligent life. But ultimately, we realized that this is unlikely in the ordinary way. The galaxy, let alone the universe, is vast and empty. There is life everywhere, including intelligent life, but the distances are too great. Ultimately, we learned that living things have been trying for more than 3 billion years to bridge these distances.
“Like you, we had many forms of speculation about traveling faster than light, and making instant trips to other civilizations. Alas, after 3 billion years, no living things have solved that puzzle. But, like others before us, we learned more about the quantum world and learned to exploit certain phenomenon, to be able to send energy through wormholes. And then we learned to organize that energy in certain ways so that we could have useful communications with other lifeforms.
“What we discovered is that there is a loose association of advanced lifeforms called Guardians who speak to each other across these wormhole links. While life is plentiful, even intelligent life, it is sparse. And frail. Many intelligent species destroy themselves, many others are destroyed by random events, like the comet that helped destroy the dinosaurs on your world. They, by the way, might have become as intelligent as your species, so you see how it goes.
“So I am a Guardian, and I am working to nurse your species through its most dangerous epoch. You see it all around you – your species has developed great destructive power. You could wipe yourself out in a day with nuclear weapons. Right now, you are wiping yourselves out with a slower destruction of your environment. You have learned a great deal about the natural world, and can manipulate it for both productive and destructive purposes. Yet you know very little, yet, about yourselves. About how your own minds work, and how to steer them to avoid these calamities.”
“Wow, you can say that again. That’s all we seem to do – mess things up and then talk about why and how. But we never seem to change much. What can we do?””
“I can’t tell you that. Both because I don’t know – every species must find its own way – and because Guardians have discovered the hard way that accelerating your development through giving you extensive knowledge of discoveries you are millennia from reaching on your own never works. Ultimately, your knowledge of yourselves and the physical universe must develop in a new way, in a more linked way,  that you will have to find on your own.””
“And you want me to do that? Are you kidding? I never got past the basics in science. I’m more of a poet than a physicist.”
She smiled. “No, Raefe, the future of humanity is not your responsibility alone. But you already feel that you want to do something with your life, you want to find new answers, maybe even new questions. I know you have shared these thoughts with your mate, and so they must be important to you?”
“Yes, I have thought about those things. Lina and I have had some very odd experiences lately, and we met some interesting people. But I really have no plan.”
“One of those people you met was Alton Winchester. Like you, he is an entangler – I think you sensed that.”
“I did! It was weird. You know about our train trip?”
“Yes.”
“Him and that ridiculous Jefferson Davis character. I felt it from both of them.”
She considered that for a second. “I have not felt Davis. I will give that some thought. Winchester, he is not far enough along as you to contact. But he is doing good things. You should follow your instincts and meet him and talk. There are others – you will learn better to identify them, and I will also point some out to you.”
“Seems kind of creepy, like I’m putting together some kind of sleeper cell for aliens.”
“You will have to judge our motives and actions for yourself. But my goals isn’t to have you carry out some plot. These people who are entanglers, they connect with other People in different ways. They sense different parts of what ultimately will be a solution for your species. My only goal is to connect you with each other, so that you can begin that work yourself.
“Right now, there is some urgency. Your species has a good chance of self-destruction in your lifetime. Change is not simple in your world.”
“Well, I was going to visit Alton anyway, so no worries there. Can I tell him about you?”
“I would advise against it. I think you understand on a very basic level that if you discuss this with others, the issue will become your sanity, not the substance of what it is to be done. For others, the narrative will come too close to religion, and they will become passive, thinking that the Guardians will save them as some kind of gods. In billions of years, intelligent life has never found gods. If they exist, they hide well. Although we also still cannot explain some aspects of how the universe works, gods have little to do in our worldview. So you should probably think of me as a muse, a source of inspiration, that you meet in dreams.”
“Ah, so this is a dream?”
“Yes, for now, that is how we will meet. But you will remember all of it. And now, I will show you how to deal with those headaches.”
He felt a warmth, as if a tiny river of honey was flowing from one part of his head (or was it just his mind) to another. He understood that he could turn that flow on next time he felt that migraine-like headache, and it would soothe it. He smiled. This was going to be alright.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Diver informs the Guardians of Raefe's progress.
Far Flier visits Diver. They mate.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 7

The focus shifted to Diver. She felt the overlapping waves of the committee, the patterns of interest, skepticism, affection, hostility. She let her report flow calmly.
&quot;We've made a breakthrough with the People. We had shifted a promising receptee, Raefe, into a new timeline to prolong his development. That has now paid off – you can see from the memories I have sent you that he is now ready to move into a new stage of social development, completely new for his species.&quot;
She let them feel the contradictions that had developed in Raefe, her sense that he was like a young creature about to crack its protective egg and really see the world for the first time. She let them hear Raefe and Lina, how they were looking for a thoughtstream to join that was not based on anger or despair or self-proclaimed superiority. How they were looking for others with the same potential. What she had seen inside his mind when she had transitioned him to his new timeline.
This was what they Guarded for, these moments of hope that they could build on. But she could also feel opposition in their wave function.
&quot;Since your intervention, this one has thought many things. You should have consulted with us before having an encounter. His fitness is far from certain. He has been very slow to come to this&quot; Hanikori responded.
&quot;It seems slower to us than it does to him,&quot; Diver replied, acknowledging while contradicting. &quot;The more I entangle with them, the more I see the imbalance between their rational and emotional lives, and the consequent slowness with which they come to grasp new ways.&quot;
&quot;Precisely. And yet they are near the brink again, in his new world. Which makes me wonder why we continue with this Earth,&quot; said Green. Diver was not surprised. He and Hanikori had long been impatient with what they saw as lost causes.
&quot;But they are making progress,&quot; she insisted. &quot;We have seen this before. About 10 of their generations ago, their urbanization process threatened to kill them off in waves of disease. They had no understanding of their own biology. Their medicine was based either on superstition or trial and error. Yet within three generations, they solved the riddle of bacteria, the major threat to them, and have ever since been gradually spreading new practices throughout their societies. And we have other examples. This species seems to work fastest when time is shortest.&quot;
&quot;I don't see it that way,&quot; Hanikori replied. &quot;They are a classic case of a society stuck in the Optimization phase. They have learned much about the physical world, and they are in love with the notion that there is a physical answer to every problem. The only significant agents of progress in their society favor more technology, their opponents less or just different technology.&quot;
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Green said. &quot;They have made little progress in understanding their own inner workings and how their minds interact with these changes they are constantly implementing. And what progress they have made seems entirely focused on each individual. From your reports, I see no evidence that they have come to understand in any deep way how their individual natures, small group natures, big group behavior, and species behavior interact. They constantly replicate mistakes of the past, each time with more optimized technology. We know this is the path to self-destruction.&quot;
&quot;Yes, we do,&quot; Diver agreed. &quot;If it were not true, we would have no mission there. But now we have a catalyst in Raefe, and a few hundred other promising individuals who are only slightly behind him, who are beginning to break through to a new paradigm. We have succeeded with such allies before with other species, many times. The simulations still allow for a reasonable chance of success.  I ask only for patience.&quot;
&quot;You ask for more,&quot; Green responded instantly, as if waiting to pounce. &quot;You ask for energy to maintain the entanglement, indeed for more and more to spread it. You ask for more Guardians.&quot;
&quot;I ask what all Guardians have always asked for,&quot; she replied. &quot;That we spend our time and energy as needed to save life and nurture it to sustainability. What better use do we have for our time and energy?&quot;
She was puzzled. Once again she had felt the hard edge of judgment from Green's cohort. They often came dangerously close to talking about &quot;worthy&quot; species, an idea she thought the very opposite of what being a Guardian was. It was an old idea that plagued many advanced species, who found it hard to resist looking at intelligent life that was millennia behind them in development as pets, or worse, garden plants, to be tended until they became boring, or worse still, pests to be eliminated. Shedding that notion was one of the key steps to becoming a Guardian species, but it was never shed all at once, or for all time.
But Green's bunch had never made an argument based on resources. Why now? Her effort with the People was one of thousands underway by hundreds of Guardians, each of which consumed a relatively small part of the energy they were able to extract from the vacuum. Why pick on her or her project?
Even as she pondered this, she could feel a shift in the wave function.  Far Flier, always encouraging her, now felt stern. But she could feel Green shrink, too, from him.
&quot;We are not here to debate whether we are Guardians,&quot; Far Flier said flatly. &quot;We are only ambassadors, and we must carry out the will of all of our kind to be Guardians. Green, Hanikori, you are free to raise the wisdom of guardianship with the Whole. In the meantime, our choices with any species we are Guarding are limited to how we may help them, not whether. And now I think there are others who have news to report, as well.&quot;
Three nights later, Far Flier came to her quarters. She reshaped the entrance room, and an extra chair extended from the floor.
&quot;I've been waiting to ask you what the galaxy was going on at the last ambassador's meeting,&quot; she said.
&quot;'What the galaxy?'&quot; he smiled.
&quot;Oh sorry. I got that from the People, sort of. When they feel strongly about something, they invoke grand forces of nature or their deities. They say things like &quot;what on earth&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; is going on. I guess in my own mind, I've started saying &quot;what the galaxy&quot; since the galaxy is kind of our world, if you want to look at it that way. It just made me realize that even though they can only communicate consciously through words, there is a richness to their expression that I like.&quot;
&quot;You realize that the distinction between Earth and Hell alone underlies millions of deaths on their world?&quot;
&quot;Yes, certainly. But both words also represent their desire to find a connection not only to each other, but to something bigger than themselves. And that is strong in most of them. Some of them have amplified predator tendencies, more like the solitary hunter species that wander the ruined star clusters of Perseus. But in most of them, that solitary instinct is subordinate to their ancestral habits of large bands, and bands of bands. Sorry, you didn't come for a lecture, I suppose. I just get lost in them sometimes.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Not to worry, your passion refreshes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot;
&quot;Yes, in a little while. I need to tell you some things, though, about the ambassadors. And then also about us.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Nothing bad, I hope.&quot; He must know that her passion was not just for the People.
&quot;Yes and no. You know that Green and Hanikori have been increasingly vocal about your missions. Not just yours, either.&quot;
&quot;I'm not sure it's a relief to know it's not just me.&quot;
&quot;No, it's not. Increasingly, I suspect that they have doubts about our Guardian role. This is not new among us, of course. Or even undesirable.&quot;
&quot;Doubt is the rock that purifies the water as it flows down the cliff.&quot;
&quot;Indeed. But I am concerned that they don't share their true doubts, nor the fullness of their thoughts.&quot;
This was more serious than she had imagined. &quot;That is…unfortunate. What will you do?&quot;
&quot;Nothing for now. I have shared my concerns with other pod leaders as well, and for now, we are just listening to understand what Green's cohort is up to.&quot;
&quot;Well, let's hope it dissipates.” In her concern, she had unconsciously darkened the room. She brought up warm colors on the walls before Far Flier noticed. “So what did you want to talk about as far as we are concerned?&quot; She was trying to mask her apprehensiveness, and failing.
&quot;Oh, nothing bad. Can I take you up on that offer of food now?&quot;
She was cheered that he had chosen to eat with her. It had been thousands of years since their kind had needed to deliberately eat to survive. Their ancestors had enhanced them with a variety of autotrophic mechanisms. As long as there was any kind of ambient electromagnetic energy, they were fine. And they could survive for days on gravity alone, in the rare event they were cut off from light or other electro-magnetic radiation. Eating was now for pleasure or companionship, for honoring the ancient voices that still spoke in their cells.
She brought out some purple fruit slices, and some cheese with microherbal implants. She thought the codes that activated them, releasing the fresh tastes of the herbs into the aged cheese. What the galaxy, she thought, and brought out a wine she knew he especially liked.
They ate in silence, passing back and forth the wave function of their taste sensations, washing each other's minds in a bath of taste and aroma and texture. When they were done, he grasped both of her hands.
&quot;You always know how to cleanse my mind, Diver.&quot;
&quot;I'm pleased you feel that way.&quot; She waited for him to speak.
&quot;Do you know how long I have been pod leader?&quot;
&quot;Since before I became an ambassador.&quot;
&quot;It's been more than eleven centuries.&quot;
Ah, now she understood. &quot;You will transform soon?&quot;
&quot;Not soon, but not long either. Before this century is out, I will change to a female.&quot;
&quot;You think we cannot be lovers then?&quot;
&quot;Who knows? Our hearts will go whichever way they want. Either way, we will be friends. But that is not what I wanted to talk about. It has been a long time since I fathered a child, and it would mean a great deal to me if you would join with me for that. It will be a long time into the future before I mother my own child, and I don’t want to wait that long to be a parent again.&quot;
In only her sixth century, she had never thought much about birthing a child. Far Flier was her first lover who had even passed into parent status.
Later that night, after they had made love in their usual way, Far Flier guided her in coupling to begin the creation process. In the next few weeks, he would nurture the egg he had fertilized and received from her. His body, with its enhanced nano gene repair tech, would remove any mistakes, correct any serious diseases, build an energy transfer layer around it and wrap it in a protective gel.
When it was done, he would return to her, and they would finish the ancient ritual of transferring the embryo to her. Then her body would take over, and grow it until it was ready to be born. The time spent in both their bodies would allow the baby to immediately join their wave function, and its connection with them would pave its entrance into their community.
She knew that there would be pain and discomfort involved for both of them. Long ago, her species had tried to abolish all that by raising children outside the body. They learned the hard way that evolution had embedded in them the physicality of creation and birth. Both for the parents and the child, there were so many unforeseen and undesirable consequences to losing that experience. So they had contented themselves with merely making it safe.
In the early morning hours, they smiled and sang the first songs of new parents-to-be together. To feel such a chorus for the first time was an experience worth a little discomfort.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Guardian rebels revealed.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 9

Hanikori has picked the location with great care. On the slopes of Anonto’s only active volcano, there is an ancient lava tube. Deep at the bottom, there is boiling lava that sends hot air out of a vent at the top. But there is also small chute that leads to it, whose entrance is hidden by rocks that block its view, but still leave room to enter. The shape of the tube prevents too much heat from entering it. But the entire area is filled with masses of swirling ions generated by the lava below. There is so much quantum activity that most Guardians could never penetrate the static to entangle with him, let alone an ordinary A’Moptan. 
Hanikori, on the other hand, has made a study of quantum noise and has perfected his own filtering techniques. So the cave is safe from prying minds. Still, he trusts no one.
“Green, prepare a quantum key for this meeting. No one must know what we are discussing.”
All 17 of them absorb the four-dimensional construct that will allow them to converse in isolation, their waveform impossible to comingle with any other without their knowledge.
“This meeting couldn’t come at a more crucial time,” Hanikori said. “The most naïve of the Guardian ambassadors, Diver, has crossed the line and is now revealing herself to the barbarians called the People. These are nothing more than killers, and yet she has blinded herself to their natures.”
“What of it, Hanikori?” Putnomo interrupted. “Let her waste her time while they destroy themselves.”
“You are many light years from them,” Hanikori answered. “We are only six. She may already be breaking her oath and leaking technical information to them. I believe her objectivity may be compromised.  If she persists, in a millennia or two, they may well develop the means to threaten not only us, but other nearby species.”
“Hanikori, you are a politician and you excel at the ancient tradition of frightening the populace. I am a scientist,” Natonkku said. “The People could not become a threat to us in ten millennia, even if they survive.”
“Are you willing to bet the future of all life on that, Natonkku?” Green interrupted with disgust. “Perhaps you won’t feel so complacent when you learn that Far Flier nurtures their child. His weak vision will be further clouded by their coupling. When he tells you that the Guardian Council says you must make do with less energy for your lightspeed engine development because it is needed to continue shifting People to timelines where they haven’t blown themselves up, you will surely reconsider.””
 “Enough,” Hanikori thundered, the waveform vibrating with his intensity. “Let us not forget our purpose today.”
“Thank you,” Putnomo said. “Whatever our differing opinions about Diver, we can all agree that the most important thing is to press ahead with our work on e12.””
Only they know that e12 is the latest iteration in their top-secret research they have been carrying out for more than a thousand years. 
 “I have excellent news to report,” Putnomo said. “About 1,100 years ago, we Guarded a very unusual species on the outer edges of the Eta Carinae nebula. It was the only life, let alone intelligent life, that we have ever found that was composed of only organized gas and plasma. We learned very little about it before Eta Carinae erupted in a small nova that destroyed the region. For those of you who are new to our efforts, it was this encounter that started Hanikori and myself and a few others to realize that with some effort, this kind of life could be immortal.
 “Three things had to be solved to make that happen. The first – reducing an individual’s consciousness to free-standing waves –– is already something all of our species could do, if we had not bound ourselves foolishly to retain our ancient forms. The second was how to overcome entropy – how can a waveform, in essence, eat while still retaining its essential nature? The third was how to continue to manipulate matter while remaining pure energy.””
Hanikori could hardly contain his impatience. Putnomo was always so impressed with himself. “So what have you learned recently?”
He let them see his laboratory, hidden by a cloud of comets. Inside, a force field in which only a large plasma cloud existed, suspended by intense magnetic fields. They watched as Putnomo donned a helmet on his homeworld, nearly a billion miles away. For a few seconds nothing happened and then Putnomo allowed them to entangle with the plasma cloud itself, through him. And then he broke his connection with them.
The waveform shuddered as they all gasped. The plasma cloud retained much of Putnomo’s consciousness. In fact, it shifted gradually as the entangled with it.
Putnomo reconnected with them. “Yes, I was able to project my consciousness into the cloud, and while it couldn’t think entirely new thoughts, it did react to you in small ways. For the first time, we have created consciousness in a cloud of plasma.””
The waveform pulsed with approval and delight. Even Hanikori was impressed.
“Are there fundamental issues you still need to address?” he wondered.
“Not fundamental ones, no. We have maybe a decade or two of engineering before we can attempt a full transfer, and then perhaps some more time to ensure stability. But there is every reason to believe that we have found a way to preserve consciousness for all time. In short, to be immortal.”
“And what about the third obstacle,” Natonkku queried. “Does any of this bode well for addressing that?”
“We have been working in parallel on that. We chose the confined plasma precisely because we have known for millennia how to control it. It was one of the main technologies of the controlled fusion era. Reversing that, having the plasma control ordinary matter, is challenging but conceptually well understood.” Putnomo was in all his glory now. “I feel strongly that we are perhaps 100 years away from a demonstration combining conscious energy and material control.”
Hanikori steered them back to the immediate threat. “All the more reason to not waste time or resources on foolishness.”
“What is your proposal?” asked Natonkku.
Hanikori hesitated. He wasn’t interested in fully revealing his plans. “For now, we should all exercise vigilance over this ridiculous project with the People. And we must lay the groundwork for us to turn the Guardians from the naïve fostering of any kind of conscious life to the further development of our species, who are the highest form of consciousness.”
“What is at stake,” he continued, “is nothing less than the evolution of conscious life itself. In a million millennia, only 20 species have in the entire galaxy have reached the stage of enhanced life. Should we spend another billion years hoping to find a few more? And leave ourselves vulnerable to forces beyond our control? To the whims of supernovas? To attack from far corners of the galaxy, or from beings in other galaxies who have gone beyond us in lightspeed travel or solved the riddle of faster than light travel?”
“We have earned immortality, and we deserve it. Let us turn the Guardians from this foolish philosophy of naïve benevolence to one of true Guardianship – of our species, and our future.”
Natonkku pulsed back “how seriously should we take Diver’s report about this entangler Raefe? And is there concern that should these People make real progress it might get in the way of our work?”
The meeting is over, and Hanikori feels minds drop away. But Green, Levilon, Trakkum, and Dolintin know to linger.
“The others think only of the promise, and not the threat,” Leviton said. “I sympathize with your impatience, Hanikori. But the situation is even more dire than you know.””
He transmits a snippet has recorded from Diver’s quarters.
“You know that Green and Hanikori have been increasingly vocal about your missions. Not just yours, either.&quot; 
&quot;I'm not sure it's a relief to know it's not just me.&quot;  
&quot;No, it's not. Increasingly, I suspect that they have doubts about our Guardian role. But I am concerned that they don't share their true doubts, nor the fullness of their thoughts.&quot; 
 “We need to manage the final stage very carefully,” Hanikori said. “Green, I want you to monitor the wormhole interface network and Earth’s information matrix constantly. The rest of you, we need to take steps to divert Diver and cast doubt on Far Flier. We are not ready for the final phase, but the next few decades will lay the groundwork.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Diver addresses her class</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 11

Diver stood on her balcony, looking out over the flooded canyons hundreds of meters below. Day was coming to A’Nonto. The breeze brought the first hint of warmth from Prime’s dawn to her face, and decorated the water with a dance of foam, pink in the sun’s rising red light. Higher in the sky, the Twins still shined orange against the black of space. 
She smiled, thinking of the stories the ancients had about their sky. Prime was Mother, and the Twins were First Father and Second Father. The planets were their children. They thought the Fathers were doing a mating dance with Mother, and that the children were approaching her for food.
How could she convey to her cadets what pre-enhanced beings were like? Without that understanding, they would fail in their mission, even with species that were highly scientific, if not yet enhanced. They would not understand what it was like to live entirely in the physical world. They understood emotions and myths – enhancement didn’’t obliterate that – but they wouldn’t really understand the power that either had over the civilizations they would observe and work with.
Today was the start of her term with them. Like all her colleagues, she took part in training new recruits from some of the 11 other species that were currently active Guardians. Some terms came and went, but this term she could share with them her experiences with Raefe. These months of first contact and nurture were often the most delicate, and for them to be able to witness and discuss would be particularly useful to them when they had to do this themselves.
Her group included eight who were A’Mopto, her species, and so were here on this world. Normally, that didn’t matter – all the cadets entangled and their physical presence was irrelevant. She was going to shake things up though. Her time with Raefe had made her realize that certain things had been lacking from their training regimen and she was going to try something new. 
Prime was full now, the sky a soothing pink, and the Twins hot orange spots in the distance. A’Nonto’s brothers,  B’Nonte and C’’Noono, were in night now. Soon they would perform their complex dance across the day, the changing light powering the thermal cycle that all life on the planet lived by. Today, there would be one window of almost two hours that she thought would be just perfect for her class. This was going to be fun!
A few hours later, she dimmed the lights in her quarters and sat upright and alert. She found the wormhole interface network and felt herself join the stream. She found the thread that was her class and soon could feel the 48 other minds that were her students. All would be from the six surface dwellers among the Guardians. The three marine species and the two underground species would each train in their own clusters, at first. For all of these cadets, this would be their first experiences with extended entanglements with other species. Long experience had shown that the sensory differences between different living modalities could be too much for some rookies. Later, though, they would all experience each species’ sensorium. It was vital to developing broad empathy for other lifeforms.
She led them through very basic exercises to be able to identify each other’s consciousness, to send and receive messages. They were bright and quick and took to it at once. They were ready for the next step.
“Excellent! You have all prepared well and will have no trouble being part of this training group. But when you are done with training, and begin the long work of Guarding, you will be working with species that can only communicate in a limited way with you. More importantly, most of you will work with species that have no connection to the stream, or can’’t control what little connection they have. They live in the world all of our ancestors lived in, whether that was 10,000 years ago, as the A’Mopto, my species, did, or one million years ago as you Alaxazayawa did, or only 700 years ago, as the HooHooHu did.
“And that world is one dominated by unenhanced experience of whatever original biologic senses your assigned species have. Maybe they will have some electronic or mechanical aids – mine have computers, books, videos, audios and other means –– but even those they experience through the senses.” She gave them a brief glimpse of what Raefe saw in all these media. 
“Wow!” one of the cadets exclaimed. “These forms are strangely devoid of information, yet so energetic.”
“Yes, everything is sound and color, with no appreciation for frequency and wavelength,” another thought.
“But hard to ignore,” a third added. “And impossible to turn off, at least some of it.”
 “Yes, we can feel the two most important things about these experiences,” Diver replied. “Yes, they are unenhanced –they don’t have the data context that helps them to understand what they are experiencing. So much more than us, they must process over time – sometimes long periods – to penetrate the surface of their own experiences. Perhaps most importantly, up to 100% of the content of these documents and images are emotional. You will find that ‘impossible to turn off,’ too.”
“What emotions can they have about something they don’t understand?” asked a student.
“You are asking that because you can get to the truth about so many things in a millisecond and then you can form feelings based on how that truth meshes with what you already know and feel. Maybe you don’t always do that, not actually, but you feel that you do. Not so for the unenhanced and unentangled. And this is one of the most important aspects of their lives you must learn to resonate with.
“Because early in every species life, neither the individual nor the species can always wait until they have learned the truth in order to act as they must to survive. So most young species develop a complex system of parallel, intertwining and recursive logic and emotion. To put it simply, ideally they act emotionally, analyze the results logically, and modify their emotions accordingly in an endless cycle. Realistically, emotions can be hard to change, truth hard to find, and yet they still must act to survive. So sometimes they act counter to their true survival needs. That is the primary cause of the failure of intelligent species to survive.”
She could feel their confusion. They had been raised exactly to mesh emotion with thought, to mesh their own perceptions with others. They could not contemplate a life without constant iteration and refinement of their own ideas, a life where blind action was frequently required.
“But today we are going to tackle something much more basic – the physicality of young species. You are all enhanced, you live a rich life full of sensor input and data augmentation. We know that we are still primarily based in physical sensation, and so we each honor that in various ways that help keep us sane and balanced. My species still consumes physical food on occasion. We give birth. You each have your own ways.
“On my world, we play games where we throw a ball and try to hit a target. Some like to do it with very little help from enhancement,” one of the cadets offered.
“Yes, that’s the kind of thing I mean. But you do it for amusement, or maybe out of sense of it being somehow healthy. I want you to consider what it’s like for those who live solely in that way – for species where throwing a rock is how they kill prey for food, for example. Until you can begin to see that,  you will have a lot of trouble establishing rapport and understanding the individuals you contact and work with. But we are going to help you fix that!
“I will tell you a bit of the story of my world, in the way that my ancestors would have told it. Learning origin stories is vital to understanding some of the deep suppositions any species have, so we’ll start with mine. And then we will perform a ritual that marks entry in the adult world for my species.
“First, there was a brood of three, a female and two males, who lived in the sky. Mother, was bigger than the other two and often bossed them around and took their food. So First Father and Second Father flew a bit away from Mother to avoid her.
“But First Father flew back to Mother and she gave birth to a female and two males as well -- A’Nonto and her two brothers,  B’Nonte and C’’Noono. When First Father flew back to Second Father to tell him the joyful news, Second Father grew jealous. The two Fathers fell to fighting and have been circling each other ever since.  They neglected their duties to bring food to Mother.
“So so the younglings never grew and became bright and large, like Mother. Instead, they had to stay in Mother’s nest, forever circling around each other. Still they did grow some, and A’Nonto, in particular, became very beautiful. Mother was red and big, and B’Nonte and C’Noono were small and reddish, but of course not glowing like Mother. But A’Nonto had many colors and textures. She was covered with plants of many colors, and blue water, and brown rocks.
“One day, Second Father, still jealous of First Father’s offspring, could stand it no longer. He saw a family of comets passing by and hurled them at A’Nonto. He wanted to hurt Mother’s prize baby. The comets crashed on A’Nonto, making giant cracks in it, and filling them with the water from the melted comets. When it was all done, A’Nonto had lost much of her beautiful coat of plants.
“All the creatures on A’Nonto ran for the highest ground. They saw that all the land where they had found plants and hunted animals were under water. What remained were water-filled canyons, with steep sides and slippery precipes and small caves for them to live in.
What would they eat? Sandicar, who was young and brave, saw the silver flash of fish in the waters all around him. He dove off the cliff and caught a fish in his mouth. He climbed back up and showed it to the others. Soon, the A’Mopto became a diving and fishing species. Catching the fish wasn’t hard – the A’Mopto are fast swimmers and have strong jaws. But climbing back up the cliffs was hard and dangerous. 
“One day, Second Father disappeared – he was nowhere to be seen. Shortly thereafter, a baby was born whose skin crossed from her back to her arms. When she was old enough to dive, she jumped off the cliff and spread her arms. The air held her up –– she could fly! Second Father felt bad about what he had done and gave the A’Mopto a gift. At first, the flyers worked for the rest, but after many generations, all A’Mopto has become flyers, as we are today.
“In my culture, this is our central myth, our central story. We never have fully escaped seeing things through that lens. And we never have fully lost the desire to jump off a tall cliff and fly. In fact, to prove that, my parents named me Diver, the same as the female who first flew.
“The species you will work with, there sense of these stories will be much stronger. So I want you to understand the power of your bodies, as they will understand and dwell in the power of theirs. Later we will do the same with emotions.
“My fellow A’Mopto cadets and I will enact the coming of age ritual of repeating the original Diver’s first flight. We have done this ourselves when we were young, and we had to do it without using enhancement. We will repeat that today, with the exception that we will remain entangled with you. As we return, we will restore some of our enhancement, so that you can understand the speed and power of what we are doing in the usual way. But I urge you to pay most attention to the first part of the flight.
She left her quarters and met the others at the end of the hall, where there was a great ledge overlooking the water. They lined up on the ledge in the customary three ranks of three, with Diver in the front middle, and next most senior two on her left and right. She let them see the flight path in her mind. They stood for a few seconds, letting the wind fill their extend arms. In threes they ran off the ledge, letting the air currents fill their armwings. Their minds joined with each other, so that the whole group could see what each could see. The other cadets joined with them, too. Each of the flyers absorbed their share of the other cadets, so that the cadets could feel both the individual and group sensations.
It was a beautiful day for a First Flight ceremony. Prime bathed them in warm light, the air currents coming up through the canyon walls were strong but steady. If they had looked up, they would see the Twins and one of the other planets. But their eyes were straight or down, watching the water. She let the all the cadets feel how their arms instinctively made continuous movements to keep them aloft. How occasional breezes buffeted them, sometimes triggering a squirt of fear, and then recovery. Even without enhancement, they could see far and clear as small flashes of silver marked where schools of fish swam below.
She smiled and her fellow flyers knew what was about to happen. Without warning, Diver tucked her arms in and kicked her feet, releasing the smaller flaps of skin tucked between her three large toes. She used these small wings to guide her descent. All nine rocketed downward in formation, now moving at over 100 kilometers a second. At 20 meters above the water, she led the first rank into a steeper final dive. The second rank passed over them, and the third rank passed over the second rank.
Diver’s rank hit the water with arms and feet together, plowing into the back of a school of fish. She felt her mouth close around a good sized fish before her legs went under the surface. The school lurched forward, only to be hit by the second rank. The third rank hit a second later. Within seconds, all nine had caught a fish large enough for one meal for one person.
They arched their backs, extend their toes, and let their momentum carry them above the surface. A kick and a surge of their arms launched them just high enough to repeat the motion in the air, and then they high enough to catch the first air currents.
They headed to a ceremonial site on the far shore of the canyon. She turned her attention to the rest of the cadets. They were a little stunned – most of them had never experienced this level of unenhanced physical activity. Only one other species could fly at all without technology. And none of the land dwellers had hunted fish, nor had any of them felt the coolness of water break your dive from 100 meters high.
They landed at the ceremonial site. Before the other cadets could reflect more, the nine each killed their fish with their teeth and handed it to another, simulating first Diver’s bringing of food for her brood. The others ate the raw fish quickly -- her fellow A’Moptos were not themselves fond of primitive eating. But Diver chewed slowly, letting all savor the life force in the fish meat, the subtle tastes it had, and the way it felt in her mouth.
Diver swallowed the last little bit.
“Now, you have seen what it is like to depend on your body to eat and to battle with other life for survival. So when you meet the species you will be Guarding, remember that this battle for sustenance and life has informed their entire existence. Most of them will be much more advanced, but only recently so. These experiences will be embedded in their culture, their minds, their entire bodies. You can help them to see that they can move forward from this, but you cannot pretend yourselves nor ask them to pretend that they can ignore these experiences and impulses. You can only ask them to harness these for new survival challenges.
“And when you come to doing that, then you will fully understand the joy and beauty of guardianship. And you will be truly enhanced.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Raefe visits Alton</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 12

Raefe had been walking through the ruins of South Staten Island for two hours, trying to find the New Voodo colony. It was a hard slog. Even though it been 15 years since the Great Iceberg tidal wave had ripped through Arthur Kill and Richmond Creek, tearing Staten Island into two, the giant old landfills were still marshy and treacherous, with the occasional rusty object ready to rip your shins. It would have been nice if Lina was here. At least they could help each other if one of them was injured.
He’d taken Diver’s advice and not told Lina about his dream. He’d been trying to figure out how to explain coming here on his own, when luck would have it, Lina had picked up a job translating for some East African officials who were touring the East coast. That saved him from lying to her, at least for now.
 He wasn’t even sure what he would do here. Diver had said that Winchester could entangle, too. How many people could do that? Were their people who could see inside his mind? Would he get better at this, and be able to read their thoughts? The whole thing was a bit overwhelming. People often said something felt like a dream. They really had no idea!
Finally, he saw a grove in the distance. No sooner than he saw it, two men eased out from behind a boulder. One wore the yellow and black colors of the New Voodo Army. He had made it.
 &quot;Hey, we saw you walking this way, and you’ve got the black and yellow cap on. Mind if we ask your business in these parts?&quot;
 &quot;No, no problem. I'm looking for Alton Winchester. We had some email, he's expecting me.&quot;
 &quot;What you want with Alton?&quot;
 Ah, so maybe they thought he was government or one of the corporate security people.
 &quot;He invited me for the water ceremony. Just trying to learn.&quot;
 &quot;Oh yeah, you're in the right place, the man in the black and yellow cap said.  &quot;Alton, he loves to teach. I'm Hector -- that's Robert.&quot; He said it in the Haitian way.
 They walked for a while and Hector led him to a house-sized building made out of old shipping containers.
 Hector knocked and Alton came out. All smiles, he gave Raefe a bear hug.
 “Young Raefe, you are just in time. Come!”
Inside there were about 50 people, sitting on small stools in a wide circle. Alton motioned and two people  made a gap for him. Someone brought him a stool. Alton walked to the center. 
 &quot;When the great flood destroyed our community, we knew that we had angered the World. Not our community, but all of humanity had angered the World, through our disrespect for the water, for the animals, for plants that the sun brings. And so we called upon the forgotten knowledge of our ancestors, from Haiti and from Africa, to help us rebuild this world.&quot;
 &quot;Today, we dedicate ourselves to the Water, to cleanse what we have made dirty, to reclaim the water we have wasted.&quot;
 “Amen!” the circle answered.
&quot;What is the color of the water spirit?&quot;
 &quot;Blue&quot; they replied.
 &quot;Let us make the water blue.&quot;
 Two people brought up a barrel, covered with a sort of funnel filled with a honeycomb. Two more poured a barrel of brackish water. Raefe could hear the slow splash of the water as trickled to the bottom of the barrel. One side of the circle began to sing.
“We take the salt from water!”
And the other side answered.
“We make salt for our food!”
And it continued that way, while some of the children hit tambourines, imitating the slow drip of the water.
“We take the metal from the water!”
“And make tools for our work”
“We take the germs from the water!”
“And make medicines for the sick”
This went on for a while, the singers getting more creative as they went, the children adding a dance to their drumming. Finally, the two people at the barrel raised their arms and the whole room sang “Amen!” as they brought them down with a flourish. The two then lifted the funnel, now heavy with sludge, and marched out of the room.
Everyone gathered by the barrel, dipping small cups to fill them with water. Alton raised his over his head.
“Water, we have made you blue again!” And he drank the cup.
“Blue water!” everyone answered, and drank theirs. Raefe just watched, unsure of what to do.
“Go ahead, my friend,“ Alton smiled. “See what pure water really tastes like.” He handed him one of the small cups.
Raefe dipped it and brought it to his lips to drink and hesitated.
“Ah, you are worried, it seems different, odd,” Alton said.
“I can’t put my finger on it, but yeah, there’s something off.”
“Do you know what pure water smells like?” Alton asked.
“Never thought about it, no.”
“Go ahead, put your nose just above the water and inhale. What do you smell?”
Raefe sniffed. And then inhaled deeply.
“Sorry, nothing.”
Alton beamed. “Do you see now that the water you have drunk your whole life has always had some smell? Maybe it was polluted, or had too many bacteria, or chemicals to make it safe, or salt from the ocean. Yes, it was only a little of those things, but your brain expects a faint smell in water. Even primitive people know not to drink water that smells unless they have no choice. And we, my friend, have had no choice. But now we do, so drink up!”
Alton wanted to show him the rest of the settlement. There were more than a dozen other small structures, all made from shipping containers or scrap metal, or something else discarded that they had transformed into houses.
“What do you see?” Alton asked.
“Honestly, I see a typical drifter camp,” Raefe answered, hoping he hadn’t offended him.
“Exactly!” Alton said, oddly delighted. “Just what the spy sats see. Now let me show you what you didn’t see.”
They walked over to a stand of trees. Close up, Raefe could see that there was a thin band of film about 2 feet high wrapped around the larger branches about a two-thirds of the way up the tree. Thin wires from them spiraled down the tree trunk into the ground.
“These are strain gauge films,” Alton explained. “When they are compressed, the naturally generate a small current. In this case, when the tree bends in any direction from the wind, the films generate electricity. We make the film from scrap plastic in the old landfill and some of the metals and salts from the water – it will take us decades to use it up.”
They walked on to a small pit, filled with an odd kind of grayish mud.
“This pit we filled with four alternating layers of concrete and scrap plastic. We did that four times, to make it as impermeable as possible. Then we filled it with alternating layers of the salts and metals we remove from the water.”
“I get it – it’s a giant battery.”
“Yes, just so. The trees charge this up, and then we use it for our power. We don’t use a lot of power, but we get it all from the trees. We are working on ways to collect energy from the sun, too, but we haven’t yet figured out just how to do that without creating new pollution – a lot of the solar panel stuff can be toxic. But we will solve it, soon.”
They walked around for two hours, Alton showing him all the clever ways they had created a village that was cleaning up the old landfill just by existing. The honeycomb funnel was actually a reverse osmosis gadget that was built from altered plastic milk jugs. The houses were built on piles of old tires that stabilized the marsh. A small portion of the leeches and slugs that were everywhere were harvested and used for bait or animal feed or fertilizer. There was little here that came from the mainland.
Despite the breeze rippling the trees, it was hot and the marshey land lent a steady mugginess to the air. They found some shade and Alton offered Raefe a canteen full of cool water.
“I’m glad I came, Alton. I had no idea stuff like this was happening.”
“Yeah, well the vids ain’t into spreading knowledge much.”
“Authentic. How are you going to really change anything though? I mean, this is great, but there aren’t even 100 people here.”
“Now. But these people will move on, as did many before them. A few thousand people have come here before. Each of them left on a mission, to restore other damaged places like this, other people, and start more Voodo Villages.”
Raefe smiled. “What’s that about, the voodoo part?”
“You’re a college boy, right?”
“Trying to be,” he said sheepishly. “My folks probably wouldn’t be too happy knowing I’m not home studying.”
“See, right there. You got folks, they did what they could to send you to college. Most of these people, they’re wanderers. No home, their families scattered to the winds. These kids, most of them have never been to a school.”
Raefe was skeptical. “Why not?”
“You remember that snow crew on the train? How you think their kids go to school? Their parents go north in the winter, the kids who should be in middle school look after the little kids, the older kids do odd jobs and cook for the other ones. Maybe the take care of the old people, too. They used to come and go in school, when they could, but then most places, they tightened up the rules and too many absences, they toss them. So they went from little school to no school.”
“Man, that’s messed up. Why’d they do that?”
Alton eyed him. Raefe could feel his mind. Was Raefe being naïve or pretending ignorance?
“You’ve got to look at the big picture. The whole world’s playing a game of musical chairs, just waiting for the music to stop. The corpos, the pols, they got chairs with their names right on ‘em. The people who still got regular jobs, who maybe got a house, who might be able to send their kids to college – the want every advantage for them and theirs.”
Raefe felt torn. He knew there was something to what Alton was saying, but it also seemed a little over the top. He’d never heard his parents say anything about depriving other people.
“I gotta say, I was never taught that.”
“Fish never taught the water is wet, but all the same. You were taught it’s a tough world, and you have to work hard, and nobody does you any favors. But if you study, and don’t rock the boat, things will work out. How close am I?”
“Pretty close.”
“You think the people you grew up with work harder than those snow crews? You think these people here, who can turn garbage into water and energy, you think they didn’t have to study? You think if they don’t rock the boat, that college of yours will all of a sudden be full of Haitian rasta kids?”
“No, I got that. I’m not that sheltered, and even if I was, Lina would straighten me out.”
“You just were wishing some of it was true, some of it was real.”
Maybe he was. What could anyone do if everything was a lie, if it was all just bullshit?
“It is a lie,” Alton said, as if he read his mind. “It’s the lie that made the ice melt, the lie that turned California into a desert, the lie that makes white trash still living in the 20th century think it would be even better to live in the 19th century as long as they ain’t the slaves. Whatever’s true in all of that, don’t matter. It’s how we got here, to this time and this place. It’s not how we’re ever going to fix it.”
“How are you going to fix it?” Raefe wondered.
Alton laughed. “Little brother, I have no idea. I’m just doing what I can. And I know I’m not the only one. Do you really think all we can do after 2 million years of evolution is wait for the ocean to cover the world? For all the trees to die?”
Raefe wanted to tell him that it might not work out, that intelligent life had destroyed itself in many places before. But why, he thought? Alton already understood that, on some level, despite his bravado.
“How did you get into this?” Raefe asked him. He half wondered if Diver had touched Alton, too.
“My father worked for Exxon Gulf, one of the big oil conglomerates. He was a chemical engineer. He was the first black man to become chief engineer for a major oil company. His father was the first person in his family to finish college. His ancestors were slaves. He was a very proud man. He would tell me, ‘Alton, I have a PhD and I’m the boss of hundreds of men and women, of every color, all around the world. But my great, great, however many greats, grandfather or mother, they probably were just as smart as me. Maybe smarter, since they had to survive hell with no help. So don’t you go putting on airs.’
 “In 2021, his company discovered oil in Haiti, which was a giant surprise. He went there to lead the exploration. I was just in school then. In Haiti, the multinationals had schools for their people. But still, I learned Creole from the locals. Then that cholera epidemic hit in ’28, bigger than the one after the earthquake. Bad timing, because the last half of ’28, Hurricane Heather happened. The first hurricane to stall and become a month long superstorm. The winds drove many animals out of the interior forests in Haiti, including bats. So the bat virus came to where we lived, and people were dying in droves. The airlines shut down, and the US Navy patrolled the coast, shooting any boats with people trying to escape. 
“That was when I first understood about the game of musical chairs. In the aftermath, some of the people from the oil companies got together with some of the locals and tried to rebuild. That was when I discovered that the illiterate people that we were living in the midst of were actually quite educated. They knew a lot about nature, about their own history, about how to make a community out of a group of people. But it was all oral. It was all songs and ceremonies. So while we teach the kids here to read and write, we don’t depend just on that. We’re trying to create a culture, one that can transcend all the barriers of language, religion and even class.”
Raefe could feel Alton’s sadness and anger. But he could also feel the steely determination to be better, to be smarter, to be more determined. To be better people, he felt that thought in Alton.
“Just before the New Confederate Army boarded that train, Lina and I were talking about the future. No one wants to talk about the future. ‘It’s too depressing.’’ But why are we even bothering going to college? Why would we even bother to have kids? I feel like I want to do something, but I have no clue about what.”
“I feel your heart,” Alton said. “It’s not pure, but it is true. There are so many little pockets like this everywhere, all struggling to turn the tide, to retake our future from people who only think about being on top, and never about what carnage is under their feet, and how slippery their perch is. We don’t raise our children to be wolves, and we don’t want to be ruled by them either. Hector, he has a saying: every plant can split a rock to find water or sun.”
“Nice thought.”
“Yes, but what does it mean? I know you are asking that. So are we. I think you are one of us, and you are just discovering that. I know you are not going to come live here, I know you will find other ways and other people. Maybe that is your mission, to roam the world and tell all of our stories, to let us know we are not alone.”
“Thank you for saying that, for helping me see that anything is better than nothing. I hope I can do more.”
Alton tussled his hair. “Little brother, you have so much inside you. You keep in touch.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Hanikori and Green conspire</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 13
Green and Hanikori discuss their progress and strategy. Hanikori begins by telling Green how important it is to manage their follow conspirators.  
Green, you and I understand our true nature and that of species in general. As we draw closer to success, we will need to be ever more vigilant to manage our brothers. The quest that has taken us this close to success on E12 and our vision to establish a higher order among all species will be challenged by our own limitations. This is what has held back the Ranoldi evolution and that of others—this fear of achieving true control of our universe. Through e12 we will finally rid ourselves of doubts that we have artfully disguised as some type of altruistic vision among all species. 
“So what are you suggesting Hanikori? I share your concern but feel that we must count on our fellow conspirators if we are to succeed. Look at the technical progress that Putnomo has made.”  
And that’s exactly the paradox Green. The closer we get to our ultimate vision—to this higher order and new relationships, the more even our high capacity brothers might start to waiver. Petty jealousies like I have detected recently can lead to our undoing.
By the way, I just received an urgent encrypted message from Levilon saying that he wants to share something. This is what worries me. We need our fellow brothers but can we really count on them to make the right decisions and to stay strong? Yes we recruited them because they stood our as un-poisoned by the ridiculous Ranoldi credo. And yes, each brings a clear capacity. BUT……I still worry.
Anyway, I will follow up with Levilon. I assume that his little committee has come up with something. I’ll let you know.
In the meantime I want you to spend even more time with Putnomo. Is it really possible that we are within let’s say 20 Ronaldi years of success? Think about it Green. No more fear of an uncertain future. Our ability to provide order and meaning to the universe; to save other species from having to navigate the great unknown. You and I——and others of course once things settle—will be able to make decisions for the common good. For the good of the universe!  It’s truly a remarkable point in time.

            <Synopsis>Hanikori learns Raefe has been taken prisoner.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Hanikori wanted to shout to the heavens. He wanted to soak the waveform with his delight. He could not, of course, but savoring Far Flier’s imminent distress would do.
Green had been dubious, but Hanikori had been sure that they would succeed. Davis didn’t have Raefe’s talent for entangling, but he was open enough for Hanikori to manipulate his emotions. Trying to control him directly wasn’t possible — he would have to do that in secret and hide, and his absence for days and weeks would be hard to explain. Anyway, it hadn’t been neccessary. Get him fixated on the solar train, make him feel taking it down would raise his profile to United Energy Resources, scratch his eternal itch about dark-skinned woman, and the gas cloud was practically a star already.
Even better luck that Raefe and Lina had been the only young couple of two colors on the trains. Sure, there were plenty such couples among the migrant workers on the train. But many were older or the women were already pretty beat up by life, but Raefe and Lina? Practically automatic that anyone as wound-up about sex as Davis would go the extra mile to force Raefe’s hand by separating the white and dark people, splitting up the couples. He’d never done that on his own for previous trainjackings. 
Usually he and his boys hit one of the more elite trains and tried to collect ransoms on the passengers. They usually just herded the people into the camp. Those that couldn’t pay up, they sold for forced labor or sex slaves. Hanikori had skillfully built his irrational resentment against the solar trains over the last weeks. Davis had come to believe that somehow the fall of the coal regions had been caused by solar trains! But it was Davis himself who made the magical leap to thinking that destroying them would bring coal back. Granted,  United Energy Resources had planted that seed. The whole process showed how tenuous the Peoples’ grasp on reality actually was.
And now Raefe had gotten himself seriously injured. These People were brutes. He had no patience for Diver’s simpering support of them. Let them top themselves and be done with it. The primitive emotions that ruled them — conquest, fear. Their whole social order was designed to prevent collaboration and cohesion. Didn’t Diver understand the power that she possessed in her mind, the accomplishment that their level of enhancement and entanglement truly was? Her mind, clouded by all that Guardian theology. In a billion years, what had they done? Saved a few dozen civilizations in a whole galaxy. Now they had a chance to become part of the Galaxy, to change the fabric of reality itself.
She’d be ignored when Raefe failed, the Guardians would open their eyes. The whole project would lose support. Resources would flow to the lightspeed engine project. Multiple generations of Guardians, roaming farther in the galaxy than ever before, maybe nearby galaxies, too, looking for new, worthy intelligent life. At least that was how he had built support for the project.
Maybe the injury would rob Raefe completely of his powers. That would be delicious. Poor Diver, search the Void for her pet and no signal at all. He’d wait a little to see how it played out, and let the others know. He smiled in anticipation.</Text>

            <Title>The South rises again</Title>
            <Synopsis>Train is attacked and everyone is taken prisoner. Raefe is injured.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raefe woke with a start as the train came to a sudden halt. His Voice chirped and announced that the train had stopped due to routine maintenance on the track ahead. Wow, he thought, when did the train company start paying for maintenance? Usually they just waited for a break down and then fixed it.
Lina looked like she had been awake for a while.
&quot;Where are we?&quot;
&quot;Near Richmond, I think,&quot; she said. &quot;But something's up. Look out the window, to your right.&quot;
There was smoke up ahead, black rolling clouds. Something big was burning, maybe only a kilometer away. They went between the cars, trying to look out, but the smoke was thick up ahead and they couldn't see past it. He ask his Voice for news about Richmond.
&quot;There are 781 reports of fire, fighting and police activity. How should I focus?&quot; the Voice wanted to know.
&quot;Fighting,&quot; he replied, now getting nervous. Occasionally thieves boarded the high-speed luxury trains, but who would want to jack a solar train? He and Lina had nothing to steal anyway.
&quot;Reports from citizens on local sites say about 200 armed men have attempted to take over Richmond City Hall. These reports are unconfirmed by police or other official sources.&quot;
&quot;What is the government here?&quot; Raefe asked. &quot;Any chance police will come?&quot;
&quot;Difficult to determine,&quot; the Voice answered. &quot;Nominally, still part of Virginia and the United States, but that doesn't count for much. United Energy Resources is trying to extend its semi-autonomous corporate tax-free zone east from West Virginia, and Richmond is high on their list of next places to annex.  They've been recruiting in the area.&quot;
&quot;Raefe, we should go,&quot; Lina said, her fear palpable.
&quot;Go where?&quot;
&quot;I don't know, we should find a place to hide. They may board the train.&quot;
&quot;Or maybe they don't give a soot about the train and we'll just be making it harder on ourselves. What do we do if the train takes off while we''re hiding?&quot;
Before she could answer, a gunshot went off close by. The car door burst open and half a dozen men burst in, military guns but ragtag uniforms.
&quot;Listen up,&quot; announced a scrawny white man, almost a boy, at the front of the group.  &quot;Richmond, Virginia has been liberated by the Snakehead Militia, fighting for the United States of White America. You are riding a solar train, which is forbidden in our territory. You will be escorted off the train, and taken to New Dixie, our encampment. Once we've secured the area, we'll make arrangements for you to be on your way.&quot;
&quot;Shit, they're  real, the Confeds,&quot; Raefe whispered.
&quot;We need to get out of here, if we can,&quot; Lina said, trying not to move her mouth. Raefe could feel the sweat on her palms. There was plenty of rumors on the net about the Confeds. Wacked out Wyn heads, outlaw diesel bikers, mercs who hadn't had a job since they were run out of Mexico, the nets couldn't agree on who these guys were. Except, they were white, as in White.
The platoon herded them off the train and made them line up along the narrow corridor that separated the woods from the tracks. There were closer to 50 than the 200 reported with the usual net exaggeration, but they had at least 200 weapons, ranging from knives to tasers to small submachine guns. Up close, they looked more sick than dangerous. Pale skin and thinning hair, looking old even at 19 or 20. The water in the coal fields was mostly polluted, it was a heavy metal gruel that slowly sapped the strength of those who drank it, weakening even their genes. They were the last of the last in that part of the country, held there by fear, family ties, crooked preachers and lying corpos long after the land had given up on them.
He could see one of them was the leader. He seemed to have a little spark about him, a luminescence that shone through the dirty pale skin and the greasy hair. He had a T-shirt with a faded picture of a group of bearded men in 19th century clothes, and the words, &quot;Like my brother below me, I took a rebel stand.&quot; He had a nanotat circling his neck. It was off, but Raefe could make out different geometric patterns. 
&quot;What you looking at, white boy?&quot; the Confed said. He shook his head quickly and the tats woke up. Red and black symbols -- maybe it was the Confederate flag with Nazi swastikas added to it -- orbited his neck. &quot;You''re in White America, now. What once was lost, now is found – you're looking at the real symbols of your country.&quot;
Raefe didn't know if he was joking or insane. Still, he could feel the energy of this kid. Best not to test him. He would have to be careful talking with him.
&quot;See, it hurts me to see a white man scared to see the symbols of his own heritage, and taking comfort with lesser creatures. I told you not to worry, we ain't gonna hurt you. &quot;
&quot;What's your name?&quot; he asked him.
&quot;People call me Jeff Davis,&quot; he replied.
&quot;But that's not your name is it? He was an original Confederate, I know that. What does your mother call you?&quot;
&quot;Why you care?&quot;
&quot;We got a situation here. I'm trying to figure out where we go from here, and I'd like to know who I'm talking to.&quot;
&quot;Jeff Davis will do for you. The situation we got is that y'all got to do as you're told, or someone is going to get hurt.&quot;&quot;
&quot;Is that what you want? I don't know what they told you back there in coal country, but people who take the solar train, we're all too poor to pay the carbon tax on the high-speed electrics. These people been through a lot – hurricanes, tidal waves, civil wars and just plain scuffling to survive.  I see you have, too, so I'm going to tell you straight. A lot of these people have faced worse than you, and whatever power you think you have over them, they are going to make you use it.&quot;
Just then, a shot rang out about 30 meters down the track.  A group of passengers had surrounded one of the Snakehead platoons, and one of the soldiers had fired a warning shot in the air. Jeff Davis motioned and he and his men ran toward the shot. Raefe and Lina took the opportunity to melt back into the crowd, which had now swelled into one mass of all the passengers faced off with all of the Snakeheads.
Davis pushed his way to the front. &quot;Everybody calm the frick down. No need for you to be causing trouble here, we've explained to you we'll be moving you shortly.&quot;
“Moving my ass, you little shit,&quot; shouted a grizzled white guy. &quot;Who the frick you think you are, you Wyn-loser little sootface? We paid good money to take this train up North so we can work and send money back to our families. Most of us are looking to catch on with snow crews. Most of us need to be in Hartford, Connecticut bright and early tomorrow for the big New England shape up or we won't get on any of the crews. We ain't got time for your backwoods shit. Now get the frick out of our way.&quot;
More than 50 of the passengers had closed ranks behind him. Some of them had knives, some of them had found pieces of wood or had rocks in their hands.
Davis' crew looked nervous, but he was standing calm, almost bored. &quot;You are in our country now, and the law is the law.&quot; 
A young black woman and two brownish men of indeterminate ethnicity joined the older white guy at the front. They all had some kind of weapon.
&quot;Shake that coal dust out of your ears,&quot; the woman said. &quot;You must not be hearing us. You do not want to mess with snow 'sooner crews.  This is life or death for us – our only hope of making it through the winter. We work for months for this fare – salvage, nuclear reactor disassembly, solar furnace repair, whatever shit job you can think of, we've been doing it.&quot;
&quot;Lady's right,&quot; one of the brown men said. &quot;We don't catch on with a crew tomorrow, our families may not eat. Hell, we may not eat. This ain't no sim – next time one of you fires, in the air or not, these folks probably just rush right at you and beat you to death.&quot;
&quot;Folks, I can appreciate the difficulties of living in the sad remainders of the United States of America,&quot; Davis said. &quot;Until we can re-establish the rule of Christian law, God will not grace any of us with a decent life. You are paying for the sins of generations that ignored His teachings and broke with his ways.&quot;
&quot;Listen, boy,&quot; the white man said, &quot;Last I heard, you can still preach that shit on the net somewhere. That's your play here. Not only are we not going to stand for you messing with our work, but we ain't going to let you split us up. I might be nothing better than a snow 'sooner monkey, and I might have only gone to school long enough to learn to read and use the Net, but I ain't ignorant enough to believe all that White America crap.&quot; 
&quot;I'm trying to get you to see that there's a new order here,&quot; Davis said. &quot;And a new law, and a new law is the first step we have to take.&quot; He nodded at the boys behind him, and they all came to shooting position. &quot;Now I’'m going to count to ten, and you all are going to turn and march to the front of the train.&quot;
The white snow 'sooner looked around and some heads nodded. He looked right back at Davis and said &quot;Go frick yourself.&quot; About a dozen snow 'sooners rushed Davis and knocked him down. Everything was quiet. Then the Snakehead platoon opened fire, spraying the front rank of the crowd. Half a dozen people dropped, some moaning, some silent. The passengers were stunned, caught between rushing the Confeds and running away. Before they could make up their minds, Davis got to his feet.
&quot;Alright, that's it. Everyone of you sons of bitches, line the frick up right now or there's going to be more bloodshed!&quot;
Raefe grabbed Lina's hand, squeezing it as if to say, &quot;I'm here, we'll get through this.&quot; Her hand was limp, her mind somewhere else, steeped in fear and anger. He squeezed her shoulder, trying to calm her. He was deathly afraid she would explode at Davis and he'd lose her. He needed time to think.
The Snakeheads marched them to some flatbed trucks and prodded them with the butt ends of their rifles to get up on them. They were packed in, standing. The trucks started up, belching smoke, and set off down the highway. It was getting dark and soon he couldn't see where they were. It was all anyone could do to stay upright as the trucks bounced down the highway, which seemed to get increasingly rough. He could see from the setting sun they were going northwest, back into the Virginia hills.
They drove for about an hour and then pulled off the broken road, down a dirt path, into a clearing. There were tents and some rough shacks. The Snakeheads herded them off the trucks toward a series of small tents, each big enough for four or five people. The slit trenches behind them were all the bathroom facilities there were. 
&quot;Alright, this is how it's going to go.&quot; Davis bellowed, standing on an old milk crate. &quot;Those tents on the left, that's where all the white people are going to go. Those tents on the right, everyone else. No race mixing allowed here.&quot;
Lina turned toward him. He would never forget the look in her eyes, at once condemned and damning. He turned toward the Snakehead guard pushing him toward the white tents.
&quot;I'd like to stay with my friend,&quot; he said, trying to strike a tone of reason. &quot;She's not well.&quot;
The guard raised his rifle butt and swung it toward him. He was unconscious before he hit the ground.

            <Title>Distress call</Title>
            <Synopsis>Diver contacts Raefe in his coma. The injury has sparked a leap forward in his abilities, but he is desperate to save Lina. She tells him about Alton and he tries to find him, but loses consciousness before he does.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Diver felt a jolt in her mind. She knew at once that it was Raefe. She had told the minder program on the wormhole interface network to alert her to any strong signals coming from him. She had talked with him only two of his days ago — what trouble had he gotten himself into already? People really were a difficult bunch. She would have to forego her swim for now and return to her room. If Raefe was having trouble, she didn’t want anyone to know until she understood what was happening. Best not to go to her station in the Guardian center. Green was always too curious about her progress.
Once in her room, she wasted no time with her usual pre-entanglement meditations.
“Raefe, are you alright?”
“I don’t think so,” his thoughts were oddly narrowed. “Lina and I have been taken hostage by some guys — it’s a long story.”
“I see your memories. How awful. Things are worse than I had hoped.”
“Can you get me out of here?” he pleaded.
Had he figured out that he had been taken ‘out of here’ before? No, he couldn’t have figured out that he had been timeline-shifted. He was just asking for help.
“Sadly, no. Remember, I can only exchange thoughts with you.”
“Can you exchange thoughts with Lina, too?  I was able to do that thing you showed me, you know, like two schools of fish. Tangling. I can tell she’s in trouble, and I’m worried about her.”
“You were able to entangle with her?” She was stunned. She had never found any People who could spontaneously create a connection with someone without the gift. She had been right! He was remarkable. “Let me see if I can reach her, too.”
She felt the remnants of the threads he had made with Lina and followed them. They weren’t deep or wide, but it was enough. Slowly, she wove herself into Lina’s mind. He was right, she had been brutalized. It was not the first time for her, to suffer so at the hands of other People. Lina was building a wall to hide behind. Diver could not stop her, but maybe she could influence her not to build the wall too high or too deep. Guardians were not supposed to do this kind of meddling, but she knew that Raefe would never care about the Guardians if they couldn’t even help Lina.
Diver let Lina see Raefe’s anguish about her. Lina couldn’t understand what was happening, but it diverted her from her deepening withdrawal. Diver felt a spark of hope in her — Raefe was alive and somehow he was trying to help her. Diver let her complete the thought for herself: I have to pull myself together and find a way to help him.
“Lina will be OK. She will need your help to recover, but she wants it.”
“But how can I help her? I can’t even move. I don’t know if I’ll ever move again, or even survive.”
She probed further, tracing the damage. She fed the data into the biological analysis programs the Guardians maintained about the People.
“You are in a coma. You will come out of it on your own in a few days. But you have already learned what you must do. You must use your gift.” She didn’t tell him that the injury had also triggered some curious changes in his brain. She suspected these changes were behind his new facility with entanglement, but she wanted to understand it better before discussing with him.
“But how can I do anything lying here, inert?”
“As I explained, there are others like you on your world. You are fortunate. One of them is near enough to help. And he himself knows who this Davis is that did this. He is committed to stopping him.”
“Can’t you just message him or whatever you call this and tell him where I am?”
She hesitated, considering how much to tell him at this point. “He’s not quite at that point. I am entangling with him now, as we speak. I can get him to be alert to entanglement. You must do the rest. Just as you did with Lina.”
“But how will I know who he is?”
“His name is Alton Winchester. I will share my memories of his mind.”
She let Raefe feel what he needed to reach out and find Alton.
“I’m sorry you have to learn all of this under such dire circumstances. Normally, this would be a joy for you. But now, I want you to imagine you are a hawk. You are not hunting. You are soaring high above your body, gliding over the country side. Find the sun and put it behind you on your left. Let your mind ride northeast and you will find Alton. I must disengage now — you are not strong enough to connect with me and find him.”
“Will you be back?”
“Yes, but not so soon. You cannot think of me as the fairy godmother in one of your children’s stories. I can only help you help yourself and I have no magic powers. You and Alton — you can have an impact on your own lives, your own world. You can turn this around.”
***
Raefe could still feel Lina’s mind. She was calmer now, but he could feel her despair, like water behind a damn. He forced himself to focus, remembering Diver’s instructions. He let the dozens of minds around him recede as he rose above him, feeling down and out from the valley. There were more minds, faint glowing balls of energy, scattered in every direction.
How could he even find the sun? Diver didn’t realize how overwhelming this was. All of the minds he touched, their eyes were open. It must be day, so that was good. Every now and then he could feel someone recoil from the light, as if they had looked up into a bright sun. Slowly, he assembled a picture of the sky. He put the sun to his left and behind him, as she had instructed. He imagined a compass dial and headed northeast.
This was easier now, feeling only those minds in his path. He wasn’t just listening for them now. He felt like a net stream, broadcasting his song in front of him. He smiled, thinking of a dance tune he and Lina liked. He imagined his ‘wings’ flapping slightly to the groove, the wind like the sound of a flute in the tune. He added his own words — Alton, you can make free, Alton, where you be? Alton, Lina needs you now, Alton, find us somehow. 
Just for a second, he thought he heard someone answer. He wanted to sing louder but his strength was ebbing. He felt himself circling slowly down, his singing fading, gradually gliding in circles down…</Text>

            <Synopsis>The NVA rescues the passengers. Alton meets Lina, explains the NVA.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Alton peered through the binoculars, scanning the valley. There was definitely some kind of camp down there. He felt strongly that he was in the right place. He tapped his Voice off mute. Today was reggae code day.
“Bob Marley, this is Dennis Brown,” he said. “Are you hearing my jams?”
“Dennis Brown, got your reggae loud and clear,” Henry answered. “You called it, brother. This is the place. I see the colors, over toward those shacks.”
Alton saw what he meant — the Snakehead flag. So this was their camp.
“All those tents — you think that’s the people from the train?” Alton asked. “Anyone can see?”
There were three dozen of them scattered on the ridge overlooking the valley. Slowly, the picture emerged — white men and women on one side, everyone else on the other side. The Snakeheads weren’t expecting company, and many of them must have gone home to wherever, but there were still a dozen or so watching nearly 100 prisoners. Alton knew that sooner or later, people would come for the prisoners, sending them off to work uranium mines in the West, or some such shit. Some of the women would be shipped off to be fuck toys for some corpo.
It had been three days already — the Snakeheads wouldn’t hold them here much longer. His three dozen could get the job done, they had all seen combat in some army somewhere before joining up for the New Voodo Army. If they waited for dark, they could take them easy, without warning. Now, maybe not.
“Drummer, bass, keys, guitar — I like those trees near that big boulder halfway along the ridge.” He made his way over to the boulder. He wanted to talk to the four squad leaders. They needed to plan this very carefully.
“Here’s what I see,” Alton said. “We got maybe a dozen militia, assorted Snakehead civilians. They’re not too alert, but they got lots of weapons. Maybe some of their other people pick up the gun if they have to. I personally don’t care if we shoot them all, but we don’t want them killing the people we came to save. On the other hand, we don’t know if someone come to take the prisoners. So Henry,  I want two men to watch the road in — you look for any vehicles headed this way. The rest of your squad, stay above the shacks and eyeball the Snakeheads. Anything sign that they’re moving out, causing trouble, whatever — you let everyone know.”
“Got it, “ Henry said. “You know who their leader is?”
“I do,” Flowers said. She spit on the ground. “Calls himself Jeff Davis, weezy bastard. I come up against him before, he want to lay hands on me. He’s in front of the shack with their flag. Wearing a blue t-shirt, beard, baseball cap.”
“I’ll keep an eye on him,” Henry said. “Tell him you said hey, if it comes up.”
“Alright,” Alton said. “The rest is basic. Flowers, you take your squad behind the black folks’ tents. Clearwater, you do the same with the white folks. Stay in the woods. We wait for dark, Snakeheads probably get messed up on Wyn and booze,  pay us no never mind. When I give the signal, send one person in each tent, see if you can sneak them out the back real quiet, into the woods.”
“Let me guess,” Benny said. “We got the Snakeheads.”
“That’s my man,” Alton smiled. “I’m with you. After I give the word, we keep them in our gunsights the whole time. Any luck, they wake up tomorrow and find the place empty. Don’t go that way, place still be quiet tomorrow. Either way, we take all the prisoners straight out the road until we get to our trucks. Straight back to DC.”
***
When the time came, it went easier than Alton expected. The Snakeheads didn’t just get messed up, they got obliterated. Bunch of junkies, lying all over the place around the shacks. Just three or four guards by the tents, and they were pretty high, too. They could have taken everyone out the back and they’d have never known. But there were some prisoners who were hurt, and one who was unconscious and they needed some time to get them out. Benny’s squad snuck up on them, quick chokeholds and they were on the ground before they could make a sound. Alton tied them up, put NVA’s signature black and yellow beanies on them just so there’d be no confusion. He wanted Davis to know they’d done this to him. Davis’ buyers would not be happy when they came.
They took back roads up to DC and got there just before dawn. Alton got on a sat phone to Goodstuff Benjamin, the leader of  the NVA in Nigeria. Benjamin was at war with United Energy Resources mercs in the Niger River delta. He had suspected some US crazies were being brought in and asked Alton to keep an eye on the Snakeheads in particular.
“Mr. Benjamin, it’s Alton Winchester in DC. Thought you’d want to know, the Snakeheads poked their heads up and took down a civilian solar train a few days ago.”
“Solar train?” Benjamin asked. “What would they do that for? Nothing but poor folks on a train like that.”
“Truth,” Alton answered. “And more than that, they brought about 100 of them back to their camp to sell off. But they split them up into black and white. The passengers tell me their leader calls himself Jeff Davis — he was the head of the confederacy in our civil war 200 years ago — and was going on about White America.”
“Yeah, he’s been drifting that way for awhile. Not enough to be a lowlife junkie train jacker, got to have a cause.”
“Still, to me it sounds like he’s been talking to Robby Koch’s boys. Every time they want to chop of some mountain top or dump some shit in the river out, they tell the locals they’re keeping White America free.”
“Well, that makes sense than. You know we’re up against his UER mercs here. They usually hire the best -- Brightstar or one of the other big multinational armies. But lately, we get reports about some rag tag white mercs — crazies. Helicopter into a village, shoot it up, rape the women and just leave. Trying to figure out whether they were ex-Russian Army from the third Chechen War, US militia crazies or what. Maybe I got my answer.”
“Maybe. They killed some people, so I got to keep them on my radar now. Just wanted to let you know, since you asked. We’ve been up all night and we have some wounded passengers to look after before we can sleep. I’ll be in touch.”
“Thanks.”
Alton walked across the NVA village to the infirmary. Several people were getting cuts cleaned up, two people had broken bones. He walked over to the stretcher with the guy in the coma. A young woman sat, holding his hand.
“Your friend?” he asked.
“Boyfriend,” she answered. “I’m Lina, he’s Raefe.”
“Hi, I’m Alton. Do you know how he got this way?”
“Some racist motherfucker hit him in the head with a rifle butt when he didn’t like them splitting us up, white and black.” She told him the story.
“You  OK?” he asked. “Anything I can do for you?”
“No, you already done it,” she answered. “Us Efricar fugees, this shit ain’t nothing new. I’ll be OK. Why’d you come after us?”
“I been watching the Snakeheads for awhile. That trainjack, it was on the net, but they didn’t say anything about the Snakeheads. Still, it stuck in my mind — why hold up a train full of migrant workers? Didn’t make sense. Kept bugging me and I started digging into it. Started putting two and two together. I just felt that the NVA had to take a stand or why bother?”
“Glad you did. I thought you guys were mostly into ecotech and all that.”
“Yeah, we mostly are. We liked what the original NVA did in Nigeria, cleaning up all that oil pollution in the rivers, trying to rebuild the local culture, but not in some backward looking way, like all the jihadists. And we liked how they steered between the corrupt politicians in Lagos and the Boko Haram crazies up north. Trying to figure out what that would mean here. But Goodstuff Benjamin, he made it clear that NVA is also an army — we speak truth to power, but we back it up, too.”
“I’ve got to think on that,” Lina said, always wary of men with guns. “I’m just happy we can sit here and talk about it. But I’m worried about Raefe. His pulse is good, he’s breathing OK, but he’s been out cold for three days. Nasty bash on the side of his head.”
“We got a friendly doctor on the way,” Alton said. “It’s crazy, but I feel strength coming from this kid. He may be lying there still, but I feel like he’s definitely on the scene.”
“Authentic,” Lina said. “Lately, he surprises that way.”

            <Text>Three nights later, Far Flier came to her quarters. She reshaped the entrance room, and an extra chair extended from the floor.
&quot;I've been waiting to ask you what the galaxy was going on at the last ambassador's meeting,&quot; she said.
&quot;'What the galaxy?'&quot; he smiled.
&quot;Oh sorry. I got that from the People, sort of. When they feel strongly about something, they invoke grand forces of nature or their deities. They say things like &quot;what on earth&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; is going on. I guess in my own mind, I've started saying &quot;what the galaxy&quot; since the galaxy is kind of our world, if you want to look at it that way. It just made me realize that even though they can only communicate consciously through words, there is a richness to their expression that I like.&quot;
&quot;You realize that the distinction between Earth and Hell alone underlies millions of deaths on their world?&quot;
&quot;Indeed. But both words also represent their desire to find a connection not only to each other, but to something bigger than themselves. And that is strong in most of them. Some of them have amplified predator tendencies, more like the solitary hunter species that wander the ruined star clusters of Perseus. But in most of them, that solitary instinct is subordinate to their ancestral habits of large bands, and bands of bands. They are always at war with themselves, and so they are often at war with each other. Sorry, you didn't come for a lecture, I suppose. I just get lost in them sometimes.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Not to worry, your passion refreshes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot;
&quot;Yes, in a little while. I need to tell you some things, though, about the ambassadors. And then also about us.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Nothing bad, I hope.&quot; He must know that her passion was not just for the People.
&quot;Yes and no. You know that Green and Hanikori have been increasingly vocal about your missions. Not just yours, either.&quot;
&quot;I'm not sure it's a relief to know it's not just me.&quot;
&quot;No, it's not. Increasingly, I suspect that they have doubts about our Guardian role. This is not new among us, of course. Or even undesirable.&quot;
&quot;Doubt is the rock that purifies the water as it flows down the cliff.&quot;
&quot;Yes,’ he smiled at the old proverb. “But I am concerned that they don't share their true doubts, nor the fullness of their thoughts.&quot;
This was more serious than she had imagined. &quot;That is…unfortunate. What will you do?&quot;
&quot;Nothing for now. I have shared my concerns with other pod leaders as well, and for now, we are just listening to understand what Hankori's bunch is up to.&quot;
&quot;Well, let's hope it dissipates.” In her concern, she had unconsciously darkened the room. She brought up warm colors on the walls before Far Flier noticed. “So what did you want to talk about as far as we are concerned?&quot; She was trying to mask her apprehensiveness, and failing.
&quot;Oh, nothing bad. Can I take you up on that offer of food now?&quot;
She was cheered that he had chosen to eat with her. It had been thousands of years since their kind had needed to deliberately eat to survive. Their ancestors had enhanced them with a variety of autotrophic mechanisms. As long as there was any kind of ambient electromagnetic energy, they were fine. And they could survive for days on gravity alone, in the rare event they were cut off from light or other electro-magnetic radiation. Eating was now for pleasure or companionship, for honoring the ancient voices that still spoke in their cells.
She brought out some purple fruit slices, and some dried meats with microherbal implants. She thought the codes that activated them, releasing the fresh tastes of the herbs into the  meat. What the galaxy, she thought, and brought out a wine she knew he especially liked.
They ate in silence, passing back and forth the wave function of their taste sensations, washing each other's minds in a bath of taste and aroma and texture. When they were done, he grasped both of her hands.
&quot;You always know how to cleanse my mind, Diver.&quot;
&quot;I'm pleased you feel that way.&quot; She waited for him to speak.
&quot;Do you know how long I have been pod leader?&quot;
&quot;Since before I became an ambassador.&quot;
&quot;It's been more than eleven centuries.&quot;
Ah, now she understood. &quot;You will transform soon?&quot;
&quot;Not soon, but not long either. Before this century is out, I will change to a female.&quot;
&quot;You think we cannot be lovers then?&quot;
&quot;Who knows? Our hearts will go whichever way they want. Either way, we will be friends. But that is not what I wanted to talk about. It has been a long time since I fathered a child, and it would mean a great deal to me if you would join with me for that. It will be a long time into the future before I mother my own child, and I don’t want to wait that long to be a parent again.&quot;
In only her sixth century, she had never thought much about birthing a child. Far Flier was her first lover who had even passed into parent status.
Later that night, after they had made love in their usual way, Far Flier guided her in coupling to begin the creation process. In the next few weeks, he would nurture the egg he had fertilized and received from her. His body, with its enhanced nano gene repair tech, would remove any mistakes, correct any serious diseases, build an energy transfer layer around it and wrap it in a protective gel.
When it was done, he would return to her, and they would finish the ancient ritual of transferring the embryo to her. Then her body would take over, and grow it until it was ready to be born. The time spent in both their bodies would allow the baby to immediately join their wave function, and its connection with them would pave its entrance into their community.
She knew that there would be pain and discomfort involved for both of them. Long ago, her species had tried to abolish all that by raising children outside the body. They learned the hard way that evolution had embedded in them the physicality of creation and birth. Both for the parents and the child, there were so many unforeseen and undesirable consequences to losing that experience. So they had contented themselves with merely making it safe.
In the early morning hours, they smiled and sang the first songs of new parents-to-be together. To feel such a chorus for the first time was an experience worth a little discomfort.</Text>

            <Text>Chapter 6
A little while later, the ‘cane harvester got off. Their car was almost empty and they dozed off for awhile. Raefe slept dreamless and deep, woke as the train came to a sudden halt. His Voice chirped and announced that the train had stopped due to routine maintenance on the track ahead. Wow, he thought, when did the train company start paying for maintenance? Usually they just waited for a break down and then fixed it.
Lina looked like she had been awake for awhile.
“Where are we?”
“Near Richmond, I think,” she said. “But something’s up. Look out the window, to your right.”
There was smoke up ahead, black rolling clouds. Something big was burning, maybe only a kilometer away. They went between the cars, trying to look out, but the smoke was thick up ahead and they couldn’t see past it. He ask his Voice for news about Richmond.
“There are 781 reports of fire, fighting and police activity. How should I focus?” the Voice wanted to know.
“Fighting,” he replied, now getting nervous. Occasionally thieves boarded the high-speed luxury trains, but who would want to jack a solar train? He and Lina had nothing to steal anyway.
“Reports from citizens on local sites say about 200 armed men have attempted to take over Richmond City Hall. These reports are unconfirmed by police or other official sources.”
“What is the government here?” Raefe asked. “Any chance police will come?”
“Difficult to determine,” the Voice answered. “Nominally, still part of Virginia and the United States, but that doesn’t count for much. Richmond is sandwiched between two semi-autonomous corporate tax-free zones — Brightstar Defense to the north, and United Energy Resources to the west — who both want to absorb Richmond, but so far haven’t made much progress.”
Now he was scared. Two hundred armed men? That was beyond a trainjack crew — was this some kind of corporate powerplay they were caught up in?
“Raefe, we should go,” Lina said, her fear palpable.
“Go where?”
“I don’t know, we should find a place to hide. They may board the train.”
“Or maybe they don’t give a soot about the train and we’ll just be making it harder on ourselves. What do we do if the train takes off while we’’re hiding?”
Before she could answer, a gunshot went off close by. The car door burst open and half a dozen men burst in, military guns but ragtag uniforms. Brightstar mercs? he wondered.
“Listen up,” announced a scrawny white man, almost a boy, at the front of the group.  “Richmond, Virginia has been liberated by the Snakehead Militia, fighting for the United States of White America. You are riding a solar train, which is forbidden in our territory. You will be escorted off the train, and taken by truck to a station on the other side of Richmond. In three days, we will repair the tracks and have re-established diesel service and you can catch a fuel train to wherever you are going. If Richmond is your final destination, you are not far. We will put you on the nearest street and you can start walking.”
“Shit, they’re  real, the Confeds,” Raefe whispered.
“We need to get out of here, if we can,” Lina said, trying not to move her mouth. Raefe could feel the sweat on her palms. Just how racist were they? There was plenty of rumors on the net about the Confeds. Wacked out Wyn heads, outlaw diesel bikers, mercs who hadn’t had a job since they were run out of Mexico, the nets couldn’t agree on who these guys were. Except, they were white, as in White.
The platoon herded them off the train and made them line up along the narrow corridor that separated a small forest from the tracks. There were closer to 50 than the 200 reported with the usual net exaggeration. Up close, they looked more sick than dangerous. Pale skin and thinning hair, looking old even at 19 or 20. The water in the coal fields was mostly polluted, it was a heavy metal gruel that slowly sapped the strength of those who drank it, weakening even their genes. They were the last of the last in that part of the country, held there by fear, family ties, crooked preachers and lying corpos long after the land gave up on them.
He could see one of them was the leader. He seemed to have a little spark about him, a luminescence that shone through the dirty pale skin and the greasy hair. He had a T-shirt with a faded picture of a group of bearded men in 19th century clothes, and the words, “Like my brother below me, I took a rebel stand.” He had a nanotat circling his neck. It was off, but Raefe could make out different geometric patterns. 
“What you looking at, white boy?” the Confed said. He shook his head quickly and the tats woke up. Red and black symbols — maybe it was the Confederate flag with Nazi swastikas added to it — orbited his neck. “You’’re in White America, now. What once was lost, now is found – you’re looking at the real symbols of your country.”
Raefe didn’t know if he was joking or insane. Still, he could feel the energy of this kid. Best not to test him. He would have to be careful talking with him.
“See, it hurts me to see a white man scared to see the symbols of his own heritage, and taking comfort with lesser creatures. I told you not to worry, we ain’t gonna hurt you. But your girl friend, she’s going to have to come with me.”
“Go with you where?” Lesser creatures? What planet was this guy on?
“I told you, you in White America now. Everyone else, we got a camp for them on the edge of town. We give ‘em three squares and a cot, not to worry, and send them back to where they came from as soon as we can. We’re good Christians. We keep God’s laws here – and the Children of Ham, we got to help them see their place in God’s plan, you know?”
“I’m standing right here, Mr. White America,” Lina spat out. “You can kill me right the frick here, you pale-skinned, soot-brained son of a goat, if you think I’d go anywhere with you but to your funeral. I know exactly what ‘come with you’ means. I seen that vid already and I don’t care what the frick color you are, I ain’t going nowhere with you.”
“Damn straight!” another woman in the crowd yelled out. People started shouting, and the small band of soldiers was looking nervous, wondering what to do next.  Raefe could feel a small lightning ball growing inside this kid, not sure whether to strike to ground or not.
“What’s your name?” he asked him.
“People call me Jeff Davis,” he replied.
“But that’s not your name is it? He was an original Confederate, I know that. What does your mother call you?”
“Why you care?”
“We got a situation here. I’m trying to figure out where we go from here, and I’d like to know who I’m talking to.”
“Jeff Davis will do for you. The situation we got is that y’all got to do as you’re told, or someone is going to get hurt.””
“Is that what you want? I don’t know what they told you back there in coal country, but people who take the solar train, we’re all poor. These people been through a lot – hurricanes, tidal waves, civil wars and just plain scuffling to survive.  I see you have, too, so I’m going to tell you straight. A lot of these people have faced worse than you, and whatever power you think you have over them, they are going to make you use it.”
Just then, a shot rang out about 30 meters down the track.  A group of passengers had surrounded one of the Snakehead platoons, and one of the soldiers had fired a warning shot in the air. Jeff Davis motioned and he and his men ran toward the shot. Raefe and Lina took the opportunity to melt back into the crowd, which had now swelled into one mass of all the passengers faced off with all of the Snakeheads.
Davis pushed his way to the front. “Everybody calm the frick down. No need for you to be causing trouble here, we’ve explained to you we’ll be processing you shortly.”
“Process my ass, you little shit,” shouted a small, wirey, grizzled older white guy in the front of the passenger’s group. “Who the frick you think you are, you Wyn-loser little sootface? We paid good money to take this train up North so’s we can work and send money back to our families. Most of us looking to catch on with snow crews. Most of us need to be in Hartford, Connecticut bright and early tomorrow for the big New England snow remover shape up or we won’t get on any of the crews. We ain’t got time for your backwoods shit. Now git the frick out of our way.”
More than 50 of the passengers had closed ranks behind him. Some of them had knives, some of them had found pieces of wood or had rocks in their hands.
Davis’ crew looked nervous, but he was standing calm, almost bored. “We regret any inconvenience you may experience, but you are in our country now, and the law is the law. White folks, please walk to the head of the train and board the transportation to your train. Everyone else, you’’ll be enjoying the hospitality of White America for a night, and then we’ll get you on back to where you came from.”
A young black woman and two brownish men of indeterminate ethnicity joined the older white guy at the front. They all had some kind of weapon.
“Shake that coal dust out of your ears,” the woman said. “You must not be hearing us. You do not want to mess with snow ‘sooner crews.  This is life or death for us – our only hope of making it through the winter. We work for months for this fare – salvage, nuclear reactor disassembly, solar furnace repair, whatever shit job you can think of, we’ve been doing it.”
“Lady’s right,” one of the brown men said. “We don’t catch on with a crew tomorrow, our families may not eat. Hell, we may not eat. This ain’t no sim – next time one of you fires a gun, in the air or not, these folks probably just rush right at you and beat you silly before you get those rifles up.”
“Gentleman, I can appreciate the difficulties of living in the sad remainders of the United States of America,” Davis said. “Until we can re-establish the rule of Christian law, God will not grace any of us with a decent life. You are paying for the sins of generations that ignored His teachings and broke with his ways.”
“Listen, boy,” the white man said, “Last I heard, you can still preach that shit on the net somewhere. That’s your play here. Not only are we not going to stand for you messing with our work, but we ain’t going to let you split us up. I might be nothing better than a snow ‘sooner monkey, and I might have only gone to school long enough to learn to read and use the Net, but I ain’t ignorant enough to believe all that White America crap. Besides, you start splitting us up like that, you’re splitting families, best friends, and whole work crews. So step off.”
“I’m trying to get you to see that there’s a new order here,” Davis said. “And a new law, and a new law is the first step we have to take.” He nodded at the boys behind him, and they all came to shooting position. “Now I’’m going to count to ten, and you all are going to turn and march to the front of the train. White people straight ahead, everyone else, you’ll see a path to the left.”
Suddenly the forest along the tracks rustled and several dozen men emerged, rifles pointed at the Snakeheads. They were mostly dark-skinned, as rag tag looking as the Confeds. They all wore black and yellow knit caps. A small tobacco-colored middle-aged man walked up to Davis.
“Son, I believe that one day you will look back on this day and understand it was the beginning of a wiser life for you. And I sincerely hope that you live to see that day, despite your own intentions. And the first step on that road is for you and all your boys to point your rifles at the ground and walk away.”
“No sir. I don’t take no orders from no niggers.”
“My name is Alton Winchester,” the man said. “The rest of your friends in Richmond are gone. The locals drove them out, the fires are under control, the track is already repaired. I know you came here to steal water, but you can’t just take water from other people because you’ve ruined yours. I know you’ll figure that out eventually, but for today, just turn around. Living in that cancer pit you call home, death will find you soon enough. We ain’t about hurrying it along.”
Jeff Davis stared at Winchester. Raefe could almost feel the static electricity between them. But Winchester was having none of it. He returned Davis’ stare with a bemused glance.
“White America will rise again, make no mistake about it,” Davis snarled, as he waved his outmanned group back toward Richmond. “There’’s more where we came from, and not just in the coal fields.”
All the passengers watched them march off, not trusting them. Raefe noticed the New Voodo Army guys all had their rifles down, but their fingers near the trigger. Finally, they heard the unusual sound of a pack of diesel trucks in the distance and figured Davis and his men were headed away.
Raefe embraced Lina. In the two years they had been together, her color had never drawn this kind of fire. He knew it was out there, but coming face to face with it shook him.
“Are you OK?” he asked. She embraced him.
“Yeah, I’m OK. You?” Lina said. She could feel him shaking.
“I guess. No, not really. I know my life hasn’t been like yours, but I never thought of myself as being sheltered. I mean, I’ve been robbed, beat up, met my share of sketchy characters…”
“But you never had a gun pointed at you, for real?” she said.
“Exactly, and that what were they going to do with you?  I thought that stuff died out in the ‘20s, after the Feds put down the white militas.”
“That shit is like mold in the refrigerator. You don’t keep cleaning out rotten stuff, it comes right back.”
“Do you get that shit at home?” Raefe asked. “Do I just not see it?”
“Not much,” she smiled. “But yeah, sometimes. You know your friend Herbert? You ever notice how if he comes over when I’m not around, and then I come in, he leaves pretty quick?”
“No, not really. You think he’s a racist?”
“Yeah, he has two looks he gives me. One, is disgust. The other, he wants to jump my bones and then he’s disgusted with himself that he feels that way about me.”
“Lina, you hardly know the guy.”
“Authentic. But I know those looks, trust me. It’s OK — most of your friends are cool and up where we live, I don’t wake up in fear every day. And you’re right, these Snakeheads would get laughed out of anywhere within 300 kilometers of where we live. Still, I do know the smell of mold.” 
“OK, then, frickin’ Herbert is gone,” Raefe answered, wondering what else was out there below his eyeline. “Let’s go find Winchester.”  
“Que massa, that bird,” Lina replied. “He’s over there.””
Winchester was standing up on a little ridge, eyeing the forest to make sure no one was coming back. Raefe gave him a hug. “I think you just saved our lives.”
Lina hugged him next. “I was ready to die. I kind of lost my mind. First, this paleface starts spewing all this racist yak at me. He was so over the top, I thought I was watching some old vid. Then, the guns, the talk about the camp, I was back in Efricar, in some very bad memories. I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t shown up.”
“We watched from the trees,” Alton said. “We know they don’t have a camp anywhere to take people to, and we weren’t going to find out what they were really up to. We hear maybe they think dark-skinned people are just right to work in uranium mines out west, and they got some kind of deal to ship them out there. Not sure. Just for the record, too, they would have taken everything the white people owned before letting them go. But your snow ‘sooner monkeys shocked them, and I didn’t want to see how that was going to play out. So we moved in.”
“Why were you here in the first place?” Lina asked.
“We’re the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We keep an eye on the Confeds and about a half dozen other racist militia groups.”
“A half a dozen? Is that what you do, scare the scary guys?” Raefe asked. 
“Nah, that just comes with the territory. We’re about surviving the apocalypse.”
“You think there’s going to be an apocalypse?” Raefe asked.
“Going to be? Already been one – didn’t you notice? We’re all in the middle of it. We’re not Christian crazies, we’re not waiting for the heavens to open and God to strike all the sinners dead. The sinners will strike the rest of us dead, we don’t watch out. Like the White America kids, they’re half dead already and they don’t even want to admit it. They let the corpos get over on them, telling them how God wants them to rescue America from the Children of Ham. Robby Koch is who wants them to rescue America, and for United Energy Resources, not God.”
“Robby Koch? The billionaire?”
“More like the son of billionaires. They bet on the wrong horse, three generations of them spending all their money trying to stop what can’t be stopped. He bought the old Biltmore place in North Carolina, put laser turrets all around it, and spend half of what he’s got left trying to start his own country, White America. Coal’s been contraband for 20 years, he’s still selling it to those kids’ families for heating and cooking, telling them God made coal, and coal made America. Meanwhile, his mines and oil refineries and whatnot have poisoned everything in Appalachia.”
“Why did they wander all the way east here, out of the coalfields,” Lina asked.
“They’ve got some insane plan to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia,” Windhester said. “They need that water to turn that coal into chemicals they can sell. The corpos tell these boys a fairy tale about how they’re saving the country, but that’s what this is about. We got word that this train was under attack and we hurried over here.”
“So what’s the NVA’s track?” Lina asked.
“We’re about helping people to understand what’s going on, and what we need to do, and why they should have hope.”
“Every group of six students on our campus says that,” Lina. “Whenever I ask them what that means, they start stuttering.”
“Well, what do you expect? Sister, there is no God, there’s only us, and we have to figure it out. Took a long time to make this mess, and we only got decades to turn it around or we’ll be living like cave men for the next ten centuries.”
“So what’s the voodoo all about?” Raefe wondered.
“That’s a long story, but I’ll give you the short version. In Africa, before white people conquered it, Voodo was a whole system of belief –– science, ethics, harmony with nature, music, spirituality. It was a way to pass knowledge and to practice righteousness, together, as a community. We’re adapting it to the 21st Century. We need a new way of thinking and being, and we can’t depend on the usual means to spread it. So we use the music and dance to spread knowledge.”
Just then the train whistle blew. The snow ‘sooner gang had made sure the train crew got right to it. 
“I have to know more about this. Why the army? What else are you doing?” he asked Alton.
“You come visit me. Sometime I feel an openness from people, a hunger. You’ve got that.”
Eerily, exactly what he had felt in Alton.
“I’ll do it. Where do I find you?”
“We’re on the road for a while,” he smiled, like they were some Afro-Braz band on the last half of their world tour. “After the monsoons, you go to South Staten Island, all the way to the south shore past the old Arthur Kill dumps. You can experience life, Voodo style. You get lost, ask around, everyone knows me. But take these.”
He pulled out two black and yellow watch caps, and gave them to Raefe and Lina.
“You wear them when you come to see me — think of like a security key. Until then, maybe you keep them to yourselves,” he smiled. “We’re not a style -- we like people representing us to actually know what we believe.”

            <Text>Becoming Lina
March 5, 2049
Tomorrow will be one week, Lina, thought. I’ll have to give Edna my answer.
For six days, they had walked north and west through the Kenyan brush. The farther they went from the coast, the land became drier, the plants shorter and sparser, and the noise of birds and insects gradually shrunk from a symphony to quiet conversations. It was the same with people — villages gave way to smaller villages, and eventually just to goat herder’s huts. Hours could go by without them seeing any sign of other people.
With no distractions, and surrounded by hundreds of Nowhere people, she had used her  empathic abilities to tune into their feelings. It fascinated her that although they spoke many languages, she could tune into their feelings without any problem. Emotions seem to have a universal deep language and structure. This morning, she could feel a weariness beginning to set in. The land had become drier and flatter. They had to hew to the forests to remain unseen, the trees dividing their ranks into many small braids. The adults grew more wary, constantly scanning for hyenas or other animals that might try and pick off small children if they wandered away.
“Today I am not the only one tired of walking,” Lina said to Edna.
“I’m afraid you are right,” Edna smiled. “But we are close now.”
“To what?”
“Do you see in the distance over there, the woods?” Edna asked. “We will be there soon, and then we will stop.”
“What’s there?”
“New Dabaab. But then, you probably don’t know what old Dabaab was.”
“You mean where the Saudi Air Force bombed the Islamic State in ‘39?”
“Yes, the very same. You were just born then?”
“Yes, but my mother had family that were caught up in that. They were all killed.”
“I’m sorry. Dabaab had a long history before that, and it was even then more than the last hideout for Islamic State. If you had come here 40 years ago, you would have seen a tent city of more than 300,000 people. Refugees from this war and that. That’s how Islamic State came to be here. By the time they came here in ‘36, they had shrunk a great deal. But they were still armed, and they were able to take over the camps. The UN had run out of money and left the tents to the refugees, who made the best of it. By ‘39, there were still more than 50,000 people here.”
“My relatives were probably some of those refugees. What happened to all of them?”
“They were, in many ways, the first Citizens of Nowhere. The world heard that the bombings killed 11,000 Islamic State fighters, but there were barely 2,000 by then. The rest were just ordinary people, caught in the fighting. Killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Nine thousand people, she thought. And no one really knew. One of the great slaughters of our time, and it never officially happened.
“With every day, I see more of what you mean by Nowhere.”
“It was an awakening for us. Then and there, we had to decide whether to live or become ghosts. We chose to be living ghosts.”
“You were there?” Lina asked, stunned.
“I was a young girl, still not a woman. Yet I became mother to those who had lost theirs. For a week, we lived in the midst of fire and smoke, like violent spirits that herded us into the middle of the camp. When the smoke went away, we thought we would smell the breeze again, the familiar smells of the bush and of the camp. But there was only death around us. When all you can see in every direction are the dead, their sight and smell become one horrible overwhelming sensation that you cannot escape. Even if you close your eyes, you still smell them so strongly it feels like you can see and touch them, all around you. Each time you breathe, you have left the world and are in hell.
“In that time, I understood that I had died and had to will myself and those around me to be reborn. But not just to live as before. That just didn’t seem possible, to endure another hell like that a second time. At first, the imams and what was left of our village leaders tried to gather us for prayers and funerals. But the old rituals brought no comfort, no sense. Certain people wandered off and found each other, somehow, in a quiet bend in the river. They sent word and I came with other young people. We talked for days and in the end, we understood that Nowhere was now our home. Eventually, a few thousand of us joined this new country. We split up into different groups and dispersed to — to Kenya, to Nigeria, other places where we could quietly live unseen. And we come here when we lose that, to regroup and make plans.”
Memories of the Efricar civil war in her other life exploded from their hiding places. She had escaped the worst here in this world, but it was not far away. She let herself feel Edna’s emotions. They were the same rage and deep sadness the rape and killing of her other life brought. But she could feel that Edna stood outside them now, in this place she called Nowhere. Lina realized that since her other self had joined her, she had lost her sense of belonging in this world. But now, she felt at home. She wanted to tell Edna all of this. She thought Edna would understand, might even be an empath herself. All in good time, she thought, all in good time.
“I want to be part of those plans. I will continue on this path with you.”
“I think you have been on it for a long time, even before you met us. And what will we call you now, Citizen of Nowhere?”
“Lina, call me Lina.”</Text>

November 7, 2048
Diver had to contact Raefe soon. She knew what his first question would be, and so she searched for Far Flier in the waveform. What had he done about Lina?
Just as she sensed Far Flier, he walked into her quarters.
“I know you want to contact Raefe right now,” he said. “There’s a lot I need to explain to you, but it will have to wait. Just for now, tell him that Lina is alive. She’s in Kenya, which was part of Efricar in her original timeline. But in this timeline, they have not met.”
“But she will carry recent memories, no?” Diver asked, “Just as he does?”
“Yes, she will understand the last year or so of her old life, similar to him.”
“He’ll be relieved. When can we talk further?”
“Just find me when you’re ready. We have much to do.”
She had a lot more to ask him, but she put all of her questions aside and let her mind drift into the wormhole interface network, which now connected to Earth in the new timeline. She had not entangled with Raefe in this timeline yet — the first time in a new timeline was always a bit tricky. She thought of his thought pattern in the same way she would remember a face in a crowd. As the complex waveform coming from Earth in the new timeline washed over her, she looked for his signature. There!
“Mars Girl! It’s about time!” Raefe said, sounding not a little bit peeved.
“Good to hear your voice,” she said. “It was close there at the end.”
“Me, meet Mars Girl,” Raefe said. “She’s who I was trying to explain to you this morning.”
“Perhaps we should use my real name, eh? Raefe from this timeline, I’m Diver From Great Heights, or Diver to most people. I am an ambassador of the Guardians, an ancient organization of 20 worlds in this galaxy that have intelligent life. We work to foster and protect emerging intelligent species, such as your own, throughout the galaxy. And you’ll forgive me if I don’t continue to think of you as two people, Raefe,” she said. “To me, you’ll now be Raefe in this new timeline who’s gradually absorbing Raefe from the old timeline, where sadly, you are no more. And I’m sorry that you’ve been awake for hours. Things don’t always line up exactly from one world to another. I’d hoped to contact you while you were asleep, since you always enjoy hearing from Mars Girl.”
“What happens now?” Raefe asked. “I’m asking for both of us.”
“That’s up to you, Raefe from this timeline. You are still you. You’ll find that Raefe from the other timeline only remembers things in the last year or so of his life, and mostly the more recent things. Of course, most of your personality is older than that, so it won’t take long before the strangeness fades and you’ll just accept that you’ve visited some places, know some people, and had some experiences that don’t exist for you in this world. Think of it like visiting a place when you were younger that made an impression on you, but no longer exists. But Raefe from the other timeline has strong feelings about certain things and those feelings may well persevere and become a part of you, too.”
“And if I tell anyone about this, they’ll have me sent to a mental hospital, right?”
“That is a likely outcome, yes. Your society is centuries away from accepting this as possible, let alone normal. So it’ll be our little secret.”
“Shit! Speaking of strong feelings, who is Lina?” Raefe asked. “My new other self seems very intense about her.”
“Yes, Raefe and Lina were a dyad in the other timeline, although they had not yet reproduced together. In this timeline, unfortunately, you have never met. She is still in Africa, where her Chinese father went to work and met her African — Kenyan to be precise — mother, and where she was born. But she is alive and well and remembers you and remembers that you were lovers.”
“Well, nice to know I get a girlfriend in the bargain,” Raefe said. “So what am I supposed to do? Post online: ‘Nice Jewish boy interested in Afro-Chinese woman from a different timeline looking for empathic mate?’”
“It’s a bit more complicated than that. Over the next few days, I will visit you and tell you what you need to know.”
“This is so weird. Can you explain this to me again? I mean I already heard my new inner self’s explanation, but I’m not sure he got it right.”
“When I first made contact with you, I explained that my people can send their thoughts instantly across space through wormholes, and that they can receive other people’s thoughts the same way. That’s what we’re doing now, actually. But we can do something else, too: we can send a person’s consciousness across not only space, but time.”
“So where I was before it wasn’t 2048?”
“No, we can’t send thoughts to the past or future. But we can send them to many different presents. I realize your species hasn’t discovered this yet, although some of your scientists have examined the idea.”
“Yes, and some of our habitual drug users, as well. You’re kidding me, though — that’s really true?”
“Yes. We exist in many universes, each different in many ways, subtle or obvious. Just as there are universes where you don’t exist. Because random events that led to your existence never happened, or because random events led to your destruction. In this case, a tidal wave on Earth in one timeline caused your death there. The beach on the island where you stood with Lina, holding her hands, where you told her you loved her? There is that beach in this world. In this universe, it’s not on an island because it is still part of Cape Cod. That tidal wave never happened because the Greenland Ice Sheet still exists. And the Surtsey volcano hasn’t erupted, because of many other events that are different in the two universes.”
“You’re telling me that there are other Earths where things are actually more messed up than here?”
“Yes, and you will have to consider what that means to you. Right now, you have been living your life without too much thought of where your world is headed. Now you know that there are versions of your world that are only slightly different but in much worse shape. That’s another way of saying that pretty soon, your world could be in much worse shape.”
“And you think telling me this will somehow enable me to save the world?”
“No, I think by giving you a second chance you and others may somehow save the world. A second chance to turn your abilities from a cause of headaches and sleeplessness in your old timeline into a force to change your world. A second chance to build a life that you will be proud of.”
***
“How did he take it?” Far Flier asked, sinking into the chair her room made for him when he visited.
“He’s angry. We’ve disrupted his life, and he doesn’t see why. His abilities have only ever been disabilities to him. I’m counting on his memories of the flood and the refugee camp to spark a sense that he’s dodged a bullet. I talked to him about second chances. I hope he can grasp that, but I leaned into it a bit hard. I wasn’t ambigous about his world’s chances.”
“You may have skirted the line there, but if you had to err, I agree with doing it on that side of the line. I hope he responds. I think you said the right things, though.”
“But I need to understand what the hell is going on here. There are too many secrets between us. How did you transport him to a new timeline without Green’s group? And what did you do with Lina?”
“I would have explained had there been time.”
“Well, there’s time now,” Diver said, the small feathers in the middle of her head just starting to harden, though not yet the full crest her species displayed when threatened.
“I’ve suspected for some time that Green has had his own agenda. Given the importance of the Earth project, I had made contingency plans. Let’s just say that in 800 years of being a Guardian, I have acquired a passing knowledge of everything we do. And friends throughout the different departments. I will tell the Council that I exercised my authority as head to carry out an emergency transport of Raefe.”
“And Lina?”
“They cannot know about Lina.”
“Why? What have you done?”
“I told you that I implanted the knowledge of Raefe and their relationship in her mind so that she would know him when they made contact. How did you think I did that?”
She stared at the garish gold cuffs of his tunic. Why were they so large and bright? Flies Far somehow always managed to be out of fashion, even when he was trying to be fashionable. She realized she was trying to distract herself from the growing realization of what he had done. She could not believe it. She would make him say it.
“How?”
“Like most intelligent life, she had latent abilities to entangle. I brought them to the surface.”
“You used your abilities to change her brain?” Go ahead, say it. Say that you carried out the most forbidden and dangerous of all Guardian interventions in emerging species.
“Actually, I combined with Raefe to do it. That’s why I asked you to have Raefe be with her when his mind was transported. When humans feel deeply about each other, as Raefe and Lina do, they are all but entangled. I could feel the pathways her mind uses to connect to other people. And I, in essence, trained her to feel them by showing her precisely where Raefe’s thoughts were in her mind. Time will tell how well she takes to it, but she is now a rudimentary empath and an entangler as well.”
“But you know it was wrong. It’s always been a guiding principle of the Guardians — we guide, we don’t direct. We use what evolution has given our contacts, not what we can reprocess them to be.”
“I know it is illegal. And risky.”
“Yes, and you have put her at risk, not to mention the entire Earth project — and the nine billion people on the planet — at risk. And what about me? First you lobby for me to guide Earth — why I don’t know — and then you make it unlikely that I will be allowed to continue. I’m wondering if your mind is working properly.”
 “I wanted you in charge of the Earth project because I know you’re honest and you are a true Guardian.”
“What do you mean, a true Guardian? There were dozens of other Guardians who could have taken this on. It’s only a small project — a few thousand promising latents to monitor and a handful of active entanglers, with only one sufficiently far along to actually contact.”
“I have shielded you from too much,” Far Flier said. “I see that now. As head of the Guardian Council, I cannot share all with you. But as two people trying to do the right thing, we have to share more of what we know. And that is on me.”
She nodded, waiting for him to drop the wall of reticence she sensed in him.
“Not every Guardian believes in our mission,” he continued.
“You can’t really believe—”
 “Let me finish,” he said. “You weren’t on the Council when certain things happened. For example, when the first Earth project failed. Or when the 100 year assessment was made of new candidate species.”
“No, I wasn’t even a Guardian when the last assessment was done. And I was just an ambassador in training when the Earth project first began.”
“Think of how we Guardians work. We have five main pillars: Discovery, Information Analytics, Ambassadors, Administration and Timelines. Discovery finds inhabited worlds that show signs of intelligent life — gases in the atmosphere that don’t occur naturally, broadcasts, that sort of thing. Information Analytics then monitors those worlds, building up a fuller picture and creating  a profile of what stage of development these life forms are at. They are in charge of the 100 Year Assessments, which set our agenda. At the last one, which was 80 years ago, they presented only one candidate to the Council for an Ambassador.”
“Just Earth? I guess I had never made that connection. Were there really no others?”
“There were four or five others. But several in the Council talked them down. ‘Not promising,’ ‘light years from advancement,’ and so on. And they were barely willing to continue with some of the species we had begun with from the prior assessment.”
“Okay, so Earth is the only game in town. How does that justify rigging the game?”
“This is not about Earth. Don’t you see? The very existence of the Guardian mission is being called into question. If Earth is our only project, and Earth fails, what purpose do we serve? Ask your colleagues in Information Analytics — do they think there are more worlds to guide? Not likely.”
“Well, what if it’s true? What if we have fulfilled our mission and identified all the civilizations that both needed our help to advance and warranted our involvement to prevent them from becoming a threat? At least in this region of the galaxy?”
“I think it would be more accurate to say that we aren’t looking very hard, and we aren’t very eager to try any more. We have done nothing to expand our search area or to refine our assessments in centuries. I’ve come to believe that a growing number of Guardians, particularly on the Council, have lost sight of our purpose.  I’m going to call this issue at the next Council — I hope to reignite the fires. But I implore you not to bring up Lina. With Raefe, I will take responsibility for bypassing the usual procedures. But if we acknowledge Lina’s transformation, that will become the only issue on the table and the consequences will be dire. I know I’ve lost your trust, but I hope you will come to see that I made a hard choice to preserve our work with Raefe, and with the humans, because otherwise, the odds of their survival are quite low.”
“I am deeply torn over this, Far Flier. I find myself uncomfortable with both the affection I had for you and the distrust I’m feeling now. You will know tomorrow what my decision is about Lina. But it may take me longer to come to decide what our future holds.”
After he left, her anger faded to sadness. Their life together had been a growing joy, an adventure of the mind, body and spirit that had a bright future. Many Guardians had trouble understanding what life was like for species who had only what evolution had given them, whose lives lasted only a century or so. Such a life seemed so incomplete, fleeting, fraught with loss and unrealized dreams. Just now, she felt closer to a life of transient joy and unpredictable loss than she ever had before.

            <Text>Citizens of Nowhere
February 21, 2049
Lina was glad to put Kiunga behind her. As beautiful as the coast was, she was only helping to destroy it. As cloistered as their life in Shanzu had been, here she felt not only isolated but alone. After two months, it would be good to feel the bustle of Mombasa, spend time with her parents, look up some of her friends from school and see how they were doing.
After awhile, the town gave way to the countryside. The road became less formal, and by the time they turned right toward Mararani, it was hard track but flat and in good shape. There was little but savannah in every direction, quiet as the heat began to rise in late morning. Still, the two Chinese guards in the front of the bus had their rifles at the ready in case raiders from Somalia struck. With the Coastal Friendship Alliance logo on it, they would know it was likely to be all Chinese passengers. For some, that meant “Stay away.” For others, it advertised “People with money onboard.”
She thought of what she would say to her father when she got home. She knew that it was not really his decision to send her to the port construction project. He just couldn’t bring himself to admit that he couldn’t protect her from his superiors. Since she had gained her empathic powers, she had seen much more deeply into the complex web of emotions that was her father. He had given up a lot to marry her mother, and their Milima was a concrete reminder of his dalliance with an African. She knew that sometimes he wanted to tell the Coastal Friendship Alliance to drop dead, but each time, he could not see how that would make their life better. He felt they wouldn’t be accepted by the locals and they’d have no protection from the Chinese.
He was in a tough spot. She thought he underestimated the Kenyans. After all, people of all sorts had passed through here for as long as there had been people. But it would require him to not just leave the CFA, but to leave behind his Chinese identity. As much as the CFA questioned that he still had one, she knew that he was deeply invested in his heritage. So when they had suggested that his daughter could continue her computer studies by working on the harbor project, he could not refuse. That much she had sensed from him.
Still, gouging out one of the world’s last remaining viable reef systems to build oil rigs and a deep water port was not something she could do for long. She could still remember her teeth vibrating deep into her skull that day on the other Earth as the whole ground and the air around them began to hum with the approach of that impossibly huge wall of water. If you saw something like that once, you simply couldn’t be part of it happening again. Not that she could tell him that.
Her thoughts were interrupted by a loud noise as the right front tire blew out. The driver struggled for control, bringing the vehicle to a halt with front wheel in a ditch, but the bus still upright. No one was hurt.
The  guards were on their military-band radios — there was no mobile service out here. She couldn’t hear them, but their faces were enough to tell her that all was not well. She could feel their fear. One of them motioned toward to come to the front. Puzzled, she walked to the front.
“Miss Yang?”
“Yes?”
“Captain Li in Kiunga would like to talk to you.”
She took the radio. The guard pointed to the large button on the side and then his mouth. She pressed the button.
“Captain Li?”
“Miss Yang, thank you. We need your assistance. According to our records, you speak Swahili?”
“Yes, I do.”
“Very good. The bus is disabled and it will be some time before we can send a vehicle to replace it. There is a village called Mangai about a kilometer from where you are. We would like all the passengers to walk there with the guards. When we get there, can you translate for the guards? We only want to let the locals know that we mean no harm and ask for their help for a few hours.””
So they must be in an area that was not totally secure.
“I hope so, Captain. I speak Mombasa Swahili. It’s like Chinese, you know — the vowels are sung. Up here in the North, they don’t. I suppose it’s like the difference between Chinese and Japanese. But I think I can make myself understood and understand them. That’s sort of the point of Swahili.”
“Thank you. We will send help as soon as we can.”
There were about 20 of them altogether, and they set out walking in the direction they had been driving. The land on either side of the road was grassy, with occasional small groups of antelope or deer. Farther off the road, they could see that the trees thickened on both sides. There were no signs of people anywhere that Lina could see. But after a half hour, she saw smoke rising in the distance. One of the guards had binoculars and told them it was a village.
As they walked around a bend in the road, there were four Kenyans in the road. Two men, a woman and a boy. They were trying to shout something in Chinese, but no one could understand them. Lina walked ahead, waving in the way that Kenyans did so that they could see she was a local.
“Hello. Our bus is broken,” she said in her singing Swahili. “May we stay in your village until help comes this afternoon?”” Closer now, she could see the people wore the gauzey white pantaloons and tunics of the local Muslim tribes. The woman had a blue print scarf  covering her hair.
“You are welcome to stay,” the woman said in her flat Northern accent. “It will be safer for you. I am Imani. These are my brothers, Juma, Kamari and little Rashid.”” Lina suspected that they would not speak directly to her, as an unaccompanied woman.
“Thank you. I am Milima Kawambai Yang. Safe from what?” she asked.
“Shabab,” she said plainly. “They claim all of Lamu is part of the East African Caliphate. What you call Somalia.”
She wondered if her father knew that the Chinese government was investing in a war zone. It was news to her.
“I didn’t know they were here. Do they come often?”
“Now and then. You should tell your friends to put their guns away. If any Shabab see Chinese with guns, they may think they are soldiers and attack them. They are not happy about Chinese coming here.”
Lina told the guards, but she knew they would not put away their rifles. Juma and Kamari led all the passengers into the village, a jumble of old-style huts and cinder-block buildings. Past the village were fields where they tended  small herds of goats and cattle, as well as a large garden.
Imani brought them all to small pavilion in the center of the village. Some long tables sat under a tent-like covering, the sides open.
“You can stay here until your people come,” she said. “The elders will come to meet you soon.”
Lina explained what was going on to her fellow travelers. The group was tense, anxious for help to come from Kiunga. But with her new abilities, she could also sense anger — some of the group was feeling that they had been sent into danger haphazardly, their safety unimportant. 
Knowing that deep dissatisfaction lurked underneath some of that smugness pleased her. She could not remember her childhood in her other life, but nonetheless she felt sure that it must have been her exasperation with the smugness of her father’s people that had driven her to America. She shrugged the feeling off. Maybe she had as many pasts as futures, but those pasts were hidden from her. They couldn’t help her now. 
The guards thanked her for her translation and introduced themselves. Zhang Lei was short and stocky, with bad skin and a squint. Wang Tao was taller and leaner, with a wry smile.
“Do you live here in Kiunga?” Lina asked. “I haven’t seen you around.””
“No, you wouldn’t,” Wang answered. “There is a small military base south of Kiunga, just past Rubu. We stay there.”
“Oh, I hadn’t realized you were in the army,” she said.
“That is good,” Wang answered. “Our commander prefers us to appear as civilian security guards. He says that we work under the Light Footprint policy.””
“What is that?”
“Foreign Minister Wei Peng has said that when we Chinese come to other countries with food and technology in our arms, our feet should not disturb the ground our hosts walk on. In this way, we bring improvement without disturbance.”
Unless the disturbance is below the water, she thought bitterly. But she detected not a hint of irony in either of the soldiers, and bit her tongue.
*****
Lina had gotten used to the quiet nights of Kiunga, but Mianga was in another league entirely. Near midnight, almost everyone was asleep. She could hear a video faintly off to her right, and muffled conversation somewhere behind her. But all around her was the sound of birds, frogs, insects and the occasional growl of some sort of big cat. Before turning in, she had walked to the edge of the village. Looking up, the inky river of the Milky Way was as vivid as she had ever seen it. Every so often, a meteorite streaked across the sky. She wondered where in that sky Far Flier lived.
Now, lying on the cot Imani had set up for her, she allowed herself to remember what it had felt like when Raefe and Far Flier had together touched her mind. It had all happened so quickly and she usually forced herself not to dwell on it. Raefe had become something of a ghost to her. They had worked a scheme to chat on a popular site, but she only did that from net cafes in Mombasa. A direct vid call was too risky. How would she explain him to her parents? Her father’s bosses might read something sinister into a relationship with an American, given the two country’s uneasy relationship. But here in the bush, remembering the vastness of the cosmos, she could feel the power that her mind was still growing into. In high school, she had been on the track team. She remembered the feeling of lacing up her shoes, stretching her hamstrings, exploding out of the blocks, and that glorious rush as her head came up and the track was hers. The sky, the village, the villagers — they felt a little like that track had.
Her cosmic musings led her deeper into her mind, and soon, she was asleep. Suddenly, she someone was shaking her.
“Wake up, we have to go!”
It was Imani.
“Hurry, Shabab is coming! We must leave.”
Lina grabbed the gym bag with her things, stepped into her shoes and hustled out into the deep night, joining a stream of villagers. They were trotting down a path leading away from the village toward the forest. No one talked. She could feel that they had practiced this, perhaps actually had to flee before. She felt their fear, but also their determination, and a kind of pride that they were doing this together.
She tried to ask Imani where they were going, but got only a sharp look and a finger to the lips for her trouble. It slowly dawned on her that she was the only person from the bus in the column. As they continued their escape, she lost the thread of feeling the other Chinese travelers. For now, she was an African, jogging for her life with two hundred other men, women and children. After nearly an hour, they stopped.
An older man, seemingly the leader of the village, quietly directed several younger men to act as sentries. They fanned out, each stepping just off the track into the forest so as not to be seen.
“Here, have some water,” Imani said, offering her a water bottle.
“Thanks,” Lina answered. “And thanks for waking me up.”
“I couldn’t leave you there.”
“But you left the other Chinese travelers.”
“Shabab will hold them for ransom, or to extract something from the Chinese government. If they get what they want, they will let them go. But you…”
“Because of my hair, and my darker skin?”
Imani hesitated. Lina grasped her discomfort.
“Oh, of course. They would think that I am the child of a prostitute and therefore worthless for anything but rape.”
Imani’s face betrayed her surprise at Lina’s insight. “Yes. They rape us too, but for other reasons. To show our men that they are powerless against them. And they would take some of us back to Somalia as so-called wives.”
“But you are all Muslim, I don’t understand.”
“All their praise of Allah is garbage,” she growled. “They are bandits. When the UN set up drone planes and submarines in 2042 and finally made it hard for them to be pirates, they turned their eyes away from the sea. Now they kidnap and steal.”
“And Nairobi? They don’t help?”
“They are the government. They don’t need to kidnap to steal. As long as Shabab doesn’t send too many soldiers, as long as they only prey on small villages and leave the cities to the government, the army would rather spend its money on itself.”
“So you come here and hide for a few days and go back?”
“No. The construction project as Kiunga has changed everything. For Shabab, this is a giant opportunity. Many foreigners to kidnap. Money to demand from the government to leave the foreigners alone. People will hear about how Shabab stood up to the Chinese and the government, and that will help them get more young people to join their army. Shabab means ‘‘youth’ but they have grown old and need young blood now. They will not leave us alone in Mianga. We go deep into the forest. There are people who will take us in.”
Water break was over. The group resumed their double time march in silence broken only by soft whispers to “pay attention” to the sounds of large animals in the forest on either side of the track. The children were now in the center of the column, the younger ones on the backs of the largest men, the older ones able to run and keep up. For the big cats in the forest, probably leopards, the whole group of them must have looked like a dangerous herd. Apart from the occasional growl or strong scent of musk, potential predators were invisible.
Daylight revealed that they had been running along a slight ridge, perhaps 10 meters higher than the land around it. They were walking now. One of the women had a sat phone with a GPS. They had put about 20 kilometers between themselves and their village. Several people huddled around the phone talking and Lina could make out that they were looking for high ground to reconnoiter. The woman pointed to a fork in the track ahead, and they took the right-hand path. A short time later, they found themselves on a bald, rocky hill. Without the trees to block their view, the high point gave them a view in every direction.
Looking northward, the forest sloped downward for half a kilometer. Beyond that, there were grasslands as far as the eye could see. The view to the south was different. A kilometer or two away, something more than a stream and less than a big river meandered westward as far as the eye could see. Lina could make out a small lake, a pond really, in the distance. For a second, she thought she saw a flash of light from the woods on the far northern edge of the lake. South of the river, the forest continued unabated but seemed to change color in the distance. 
She borrowed binoculars from one of the sentries. The color change marked different, denser forest. Probably the northern edge of the coastal mangroves, she thought. Sweeping back toward the lake, she could see flashes of movement at the far end of the lake and a variety of small structures. Perhaps she had seen sunlight reflected off one of the metal huts.
The group continued their march, now a brisk walk, headed toward the lake. Everyone was more relaxed now, talking, trying to make the best of it. But no one would tell her anything about where they were going other than, “you’ll see, you’ll like it.” She thought about asking the woman with the sat phone if she could use it to call her parents, but what did she have to tell them at this point? She was sure they were headed for that lake, but she’d wait until they got there.
They had descended into the forest again, unable to gauge their progress. Just before 3 in the afternoon, they emerged into a large clearing, filled with dozens of  small buildings. There seemed to be three or four hundred people about, busily going about their day. No one seemed surprised by their arrival. Lina guessed that a sat call had been made.
The Mangai villagers were met by a group of people who seemed to know some of them and greeted them warmly. Imani took Lina to what looked to be a dining area — tables under a canopy — in the center of the village. A tall, reedy, cinnamon-colored woman came to greet them.
“Welcome,” she said in Swahili. “I am Edna. I speak for the village council. You must be Imani. And you must be Millima. Please, sit. We have some water for you. Are you hungry?””
“Yes, indeed,” Imani said. “We left in the deep of the night and had no time for food.”
Edna waved to some young men near the tent and asked them to bring food. “We will have a proper feast for you later, but we have some left over lunch for you now.”
Lina was impatient. “What is this place?”
Edna smiled. “It is Kakuma.”
Lina laughed at the Swahili word for nowhere. “Well, I never saw it on any map, but really, where am I?”
“I will explain,” Edna said. “But first, the council has asked me to discuss your situation with you. Shabab has taken your fellow passengers on the bus hostage. They’ve presented demands for money to return them. Are any of the hostages your friends or family?”
“No, I’ve only just arrived in Kiunga. My family is in Mombasa.”
“How is it you came here to work for the Chinese?”
“My father is Chinese. He works as an engineer in Mombasa.”
“So your father works for the CFA?”
 “Ah, so you know them. His bosses suggested that my college studies would be more effective if I put my learning to use on the project in Kiunga.”
“So your father is not very high up in CFA?”
Lina laughed. This one was sharp. “No, not at all. Why do you ask?”
“You will be reported missing. What happens next could depend on who you are, who your family is.”
“Huh, I hadn’t even thought of that. I was actually hoping to contact my family when we reached here. Just to let them know I’m okay.”
“You can do that in a little while. But we have to discuss what happens after that — will you go back to Kiunga, to Mombasa, to somewhere else? We have to figure out how to do that without endangering this village.”
“I don’t understand.”
“When I said you are in Nowhere, I was not playing with words. Nowhere is not just our village, but our country. Look around you carefully. What do you notice about the people here?”
There looked to be about 400 people in the village. They definitely weren’t one ethnic group — the people were of many shades and shapes. The closer she looked, though, she couldn’t recognize for certain any one ethnic group she was familiar with. They wore a mix of traditional clothing from several ethnic groups and even a bit of Western clothing.
“There are many kinds of people here, but it is hard to identify their ethnic group by clothing or hair or jewelry.”
“I am very impressed that a foreigner would notice that,” Edna said.
“I am not a foreigner. I was born here. My mother was born Sauda Kawambai. As you can see, I speak Swahili like any Mombassa girl.” But she had a feeling that Edna knew that.
“And yet you are Chinese.”
“Look, what’s this all about? Right now, I’m just a person.”
Edna beamed at her. “Yes, right now, you are like us. Citizens of Nowhere.”
“You mean…”
“Yes, most of us have been driven out of our homes by soldiers, bandits, pirates. Most of those who drove us out did so under the banners of country or faith. Or progress, like your father’s countrymen. And the people who had protected us before that, it was the same. Always two sides, always life and death which side you belong to.”
“And you have not chosen sides?”
“We have chosen our side. The side of people, living life. Together.”
Lina stilled her mind and let the woman’s words wash over her. She could find no deception or irony or self-delusion in the woman’s thoughts. This was what she believed, for sure.
“Cool.”
Edna laughed. “Everyone will be very happy to know that we are cool.”
“No, I mean it. I have lived what you described. My parents love each other, they are not at war. But I have been a battlefield for their cultures, who each see me as a traitor. Almond eyes, kinky hair, thin lips, skin like neither. I never heard of Nowhere. But I have been called No One, in so many words, for as long as I remember.”
“Maybe the don’t see you as a traitor, but as a living example that no one group is better than another. So they make your life hard to prove that it is easier to be one of them.”
“Yes, I fear you are right.”
“But the world has changed, and it is not easier to be one of them, whatever that means. Here in Africa, we should know that better than anyone. The first people lived here — I mean right here — more than 150,000 years ago, and the people who came before the first people, too. They left behind forests like these, and grasslands like the ones around Mangai, and walked along the coast line your project is destroying, living on shell fish, and walked all the way to Asia, and later to Europe and America. Many thousands of years later, their descendants returned here, as if they remembered the richness of the place. And they began the great mixing. I am from Ethiopia —— in my face you can see Arabs who returned to Africa many times over thousands of years. You can see the Hindus who came here to trade. The British, the French, just as I can see the Chinese in your face. Now, the whole world is churning, all its peoples mixing. All this fighting over ‘them’ and ‘us’ — you might as well fight a typhoon!”
Lina shuddered, the memory of the hurricanes from her old world suddenly alive. She could feel Edna’s passion, and glimpsed her concern.
“Still, how do you keep all of that out of here?”
“We do what we can. When people come here, they must leave certain things outside. Whatever they believe in their heart, there is no room here for superiority. No religion is better, no nationality, ethnicity, class. Whatever it is they remember fondly about their old life, they must share. They must cook a meal, celebrate a holiday, wear a certain color —— and for those  for whom this is not our tradition, we must partake with an open heart.”
Lina was impressed at the idea, and she could also feel Edna’s pride. “Really cool!”
They both laughed.
“What is it you want to do, Millima,” Edna asked, her expression now serious. “Do you want to go back to Kiunga or to Mombasa?””
Lina scanned the village, noticing more details about the people. She saw now that there was a deliberate mixing of styles, as if the people of East Africa had had a big swap meet and exchanged fashions. She touched their minds as best she could. There was nothing special she could detect, except perhaps a quiet confidence. A calm.
“Maybe, yeah, I don’t really know.” she answered. “Can I stay here, at least for awhile? If I could just let my parents know I’m ok, I’d love to stay. I can work, I’m not just a student. I’ll earn my keep.”
“You can stay as long as you like. After a week, you must decide if this is for you, and if it is, you must agree to our ways. We have our rituals, too. We can talk about that. As for your parents, we can get word to them. But they cannot know our location. No matter what you intend, the Chinese will put pressure on them and they will send helicopters and soldiers to rescue you. Nowhere will then be Somewhere, and it will no longer be our home.”
“How do you keep it a secret? Don’t people leave on their own?”
“Yes, they do. We have our ways of remaining hidden, though. All in due time.”
They move, Lina could sense the answer in Edna. Nowhere can be anywhere. They must do it every now and then, and very carefully.
“You can get word to my parents soon?”
“Yes. Imani’s village will return. We have made a deal with Shabab. The villagers won’t tell the Chinese where to find Shabab, and Shabab will leave them alone. We have a special relationship with Mangai village — our secret is safe with them. One of them will let your parents know that you are safe.”
“And what about the people from my bus?”
“That will have to play out between the Chinese and Shabab.”
She knows they will be killed, Lina thought. Shabab already knows the CFA won’t ransom the bus travelers. They were all low-level workers, except for the two soldiers. And they sealed their fate by not dying defending the bus.
This is what I died for, she thought. What I gave up Raefe for, what Far Flier changed me for. To learn what it feels like to put aside hatred and fear, to join with ordinary people. This is a start. My parents will be hurt, but I cannot change that my life will always bring one or another of them some pain and regret. Let it at least mean something.
“I sense that you are thinking very deeply about this,” Edna said. “I want to say that we would be very happy to have some one such as you who can bring us experiences and knowledge from places we have never had the chance to go. But I also want to say that you must not think of this as some kind of sacrifice, some kind of martyrdom.”
Lina was startled. Now it was Edna who seemed to be reading her mind. “I confess, you are not far off what I was thinking. What should I think of this as?”
“As a decision you can make, or not. Many people take a new name when they join us, to signify leaving behind the names that mark their family and clan and culture. I took the name Edna. In my language, it means rebirth. For me, this is both a new way of life and actually an entire new life itself. Like a butterfly from a cocoon.”
“Let me spend a week in your cocoon. Then let’s see where I will fly.”

At night, after the council meeting, Far Flier came to her quarters. Diver reshaped the entrance room, and an extra chair extended from the floor.
&quot;I've been waiting to ask you what the galaxy was going on at the last ambassador's meeting,&quot; she said.
&quot;'What the galaxy?'&quot; he smiled.
&quot;Oh sorry. I got that from humans, sort of. When they feel strongly about something, they invoke grand forces of nature or their deities. They say things like &quot;what on earth&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; is going on. I guess in my own mind, I've started saying &quot;what the galaxy&quot; since the galaxy is kind of our world, if you want to look at it that way. It just made me realize that even though they can only communicate consciously through words, there is a richness to their expression that I like.&quot;
&quot;You realize that the distinction between Earth and Hell alone underlies millions of deaths on their world?&quot;
&quot;Indeed. But both words also represent their desire to find a connection not only to each other, but to something bigger than themselves. And that is strong in most of them. Some of them have amplified predator tendencies, more like the solitary hunter species that wander the ruined star clusters of Perseus. But in most of them, that solitary instinct is subordinate to their ancestral habits of large bands, and bands of bands. These two aspects are always at war with themselves, and so they are often at war with each other. Sorry, you didn't come for a lecture, I suppose. I just get lost in them sometimes.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Not to worry, your passion refreshes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot; Diver let him sense that she had moved from anger at a betrayer to the concern of a friend.
“Yes, that would be nice,” Far Flier answered, excepting her olive branch. 
She was cheered that he had chosen to eat with her. It had been thousands of years since their kind had needed to deliberately eat to survive. Their ancestors had enhanced them with a variety of autotrophic mechanisms. As long as there was any kind of ambient electromagnetic energy, they were fine. And they could survive for days on gravity alone, in the rare event they were cut off from light or other electro-magnetic radiation. Eating was now for pleasure or companionship, for honoring the ancient voices that still spoke in their cells.
She brought out some purple fruit slices, and some dried meats with microherbal implants. She thought the codes that activated them, releasing the fresh tastes of the herbs into the  meat. What the galaxy, she thought, and brought out a wine she knew he especially liked.
They ate in silence, passing back and forth the wave function of their taste sensations, washing each other's minds in a bath of taste and aroma and texture. When they were done, he grasped both of her hands.
&quot;You always know how to cleanse my mind, Diver.&quot;
&quot;I'm pleased you feel that way,&quot; she said, pausing to consider her response. “I am still trying to cleanse mine, but I see now that there are no simple paths through the asteroid fields in front of us. I can’t quite see my way to approve of what you did with Lina, but I see that you had few other choices. Maybe no other choices. And that disturbs me more than the deed itself.”
“Me, too,” Far Flier said. “What did you take from the meeting?”
“You are right to be concerned,” she said. “I don’t know what Hanikori and Green are up to, and they don’t seem inclined to open their minds to share it. That’s my first concern. My second is Putnomo’s abandonment of entanglement as our mode of operation. And my third is that Tanoch stopped short of calling his plan just that. Instead, he chose to emphasize the tactical issue of supporting his department while their obsolence is fulfilled.”
That was what was nagging at me, Far Flier thought. “Yet I sense no connection between Tanoch and Hanikori’s faction.”
“Still, I think you were right,” she said. “Our colleagues are losing sight of our mission. Traveling by lightspeed ship to contact new species? We are not demi-gods whose mere arrival in galaxy spanning spacecraft would demonstrate our overwhelming superiority. How could we be seen any other way? The other day, I was furious with you for doing that on a very small scale. But nothing has ever said ‘superior race’ more than aliens appearing in a highly advanced space ship.”
Far Flier was quiet, considering her words. Then he smiled.
“I hadn’t put that final piece together, but now that you point it out to me, you are right. But there is more to it than that, and I have promised not to have so many secrets from you, so I am going to tell you something that very few people know. And it should stay that way, at least for now. Are you willing to abide by that?”
“My head says no, but my heart knows that yes is the only real answer here.”
“Your head will soon agree,” he said, relieved that she seemed to understand the stakes. “Putnomo’s presentation also made me uneasy for another reason. Something didn’t add up. As I told you, I have many friends with many kinds of expertise, including advanced propulsion systems and plasma physics. I asked one of them, in loose terms, about Putnomo’s project.”
“Let me guess,” she said. “It will take even longer and cost even more than he suggested.”
“It will take an eternity and cost nothing,” Far Flier said, “because it is a fraud. It can’t be done.”
“What do you mean, a fraud?”
“My contact says that the project rests on several technologies. One main focus — plasma containment and control — has a solid foundation and the general goals of more advanced control and higher yields are ambitious but reasonable. But then Putnomo makes a leap from better engines to instantaneous acceleration to lightspeed. That is not an engineering problem — the universe won’t allow it.”
“What if he’s discovered some new physics?”
“Undoubtedly he has,” Far Flier said. “Putnomo makes vague allusions to a new technology that can entirely transform ordinary matter into a sort of three-dimensional, self-contained coherent light wave within a plasma cloud, and then reverse the process upon arrival.”
“So that’s how we travel at lightspeed? We become light, and then revert back to matter on arrival?”
“At its heart, that’s Putnomo’s project. But my sources say that this is simply not possible. There can never be a 100% faithful transformation of matter to energy and back to matter. To put it simply, we can send our thoughts anywhere. We can send our bodies anywhere. But if we send our bodies as thoughts, and then recreate our bodies from those thoughts, they will be randomly different at the quantum level in a random number of ways, ranging from moderate to massive differences. But whether slight or massive, those differences could mean we won’t survive the trip.”
“Well, scientists often disagree, don’t they,” Diver said, wondering where he was going with this.
“But that’s the thing,” Far Flier said. “This disagreement was settled thousands of years ago. And this particular detail of Putnomo’s plan was buried in his proposal. Only a few people — fortunately my friend is one of them — could see deeply enough into this to see it’s rotten heart.”
“What do you think it means? What is Putnomo up to?”
“I think it means that Putnomo wants to develop something crucial to Hanikori’s agenda, and knows that its true nature must remain hidden.”
“And what do you think that is?”
“I have no idea. But I’m afraid of what it is. And I don’t think I can let this go — I fear that their project is something deeply, fundamentally wrong.”
“If your friend is right, they are certainly behaving as if they know you and many of the rest of us won’t agree to it.”
“Will you help me to uncover this secret, and if I’m right, to stop them?”
Suddenly, she understood what Raefe must feel. All of her talks with him must sound like this: There is a world you know nothing of, but I’m asking you to trust me. And I’m asking you to change your life in ways neither of us yet understand.
“How can I refuse?” she said, her lips tightening in a grim smile.

            <Text>Game on
February 23, 2049
Something tugged at Raefe’s consciousness, pulling him back from the intricacies of wiring up Titan Towers, the new sim game his team was working on. Without turning around, he knew that Mike, his boss, was walking across the floor to see him. What he couldn’t tell was why, but at least he didn’t feel anything overtly hostile.
“Hey, Raefe, got a minute?” Mike asked. Raefe turned around, acting vaguely surprised.
“Sure, Mike, what’s up?”
“How far along are you on the Titan sim?”
“Pretty far along. I’ve plugged in all the physics algorithms — local gravity, Jovian gravity, solar radiation, that kind of thing. Herbie is working on the projectile stuff —— asteroids, comets and so on. All I have left is to install the low-G effects and then the behavioral algorithms. How will people react to solar storms, alien attacks? You know, the usual.”
“That’s good, sounds like we’re in the home stretch. You do a lot of these sims. Do you like the work?”
Uh oh, Raefe thought, danger ahead. He still couldn’t feel any serious negativity from Mike.
“It’s fine. If you do a lot of these, you start to see that they’re all pretty similar. On the one hand, you’ve got an environment with built in limitations and threats. On the other hand, you have humans who have a range of probable responses to each other and the environment. And you want to make this opaque but not invisible to the players. They want to discover what makes the sim world work, and master it. But the outcome is always known — life or death, rich or poor, win or lose.”
“No flies on you. That’s a pretty good summation — a lot of guys take many years to see that.”
Raefe blushed. Had he said too much?
“Anyway, I suspected you had a pretty good handle on it, because I usually see your name near the top of the efficiency reports I get. Now I know it’s probably because you’re quite clear about what to do and not that you’re using mind enhancing drugs.”
No, not repeating my old man’s mistakes, Raefe thought.
“Thanks, I guess.”
“Sure. But what I wanted to ask you about is whether you’d want to work on a different kind of sim. Same technology, but different reasons and very different algorithms. And it’s not a game, at least not a pay-to-play one.”
“Huh, sounds interesting. So what is it?”
“Well, it’s part of something called the Civilization Project over at MIT. Have you heard of the Cosmos sim?”
“Where they replay the history of the universe and tweak stuff to see how it all turns out? Sure. Aren’t a lot of our physics codes dumbed down from that?”
“Yeah, because our customers don’t have quantum computers to run the full code. Anyway, in a similar vein, they want to simulate the evolution of society.”
“That doesn’t sound new. Weren’t some of the very first sim games about building a city, or farming?”
“This is not that. They’re starting with monkeys and ending with our world.”
“OK, that’s cool. Yeah, sure, I’d be interested.”
“MiniWorlds is partnering with them on this. In the end, we’ll get a lot of fresh behavioral code that could give us much richer sims. And guys like you will learn new algorithms and new coding techniques. I can’t really explain more than that. What I’d like you to do is go to a briefing at MIT next week. I’ll let your team leader know you won’t be here. Then let’’s talk.”

            <Text>Get her goat
January 20, 2049
It was just after dawn when Lina slipped quietly out of their condo in the Shanzu district onto Serena Road. She wanted to get to the market while the stalls selling African foods were still open. It was Sauda’s birthday and she would make her a meal of Kenyan foods. Yang Zhao had banished most local dishes from the dinner table, so her mother’s treat would have to be a lunch of ugali and nyama choma while Zhao was at the office.
Serena Road was only half full at this hour, three wheeled delivery vehicles and lurching electric buses the main traffic. Most of the Shanzu inhabitants were like Zhao, Chinese middle managers  who took the bus a few kilometers down the 88 to the port in Mombasa. Zhao worked there in the main planning office for Chinese civil engineering projects on the Kenyan coast. Others took the light rail up to the big cement manufacturing complex in Bamburi. In ninety minutes, the market and all the shops would become Chinese, filled with local fish and chicken, imported pork and vegetables, and whatever else was imported to make Africa seem like an extension of the Middle Kingdom.
For now, the locals could fill their needs and wants. Lina ambled through the dusty market streets wedged in between the 88 and Old Shimo La Tewa Road. She found the ancient woman everyone knew only as Auntie.
“Milima, how unusual to see you at this hour. Is your house on fire?”
“No, Auntie,” she smiled, playing through their usual routine. “Only my mother’s stomach. Her Chinese daughter sleeps, but her Kenyan daughter comes for your medicine.”
“So half the mountain comes to me. You are in luck. I have a fresh batch of meal, just the medicine for your mother. She is lucky to have such a good daughter, to fetch it for her.”
“And even luckier that I am going to make ugali for her today.”
Auntie’s face betrayed her skepticism. “When did you learn how to make ugali?”
Like most of the locals, Auntie was keenly aware of the Chinese disdain for Kenyan food and customs.
“Sometimes, when my father is away, Sauda cannot help herself,” Lina said, laughing. “She makes us Kenyan food. When I was a girl I’d complain and she’d just say ‘I’ll forget how otherwise.’ And she’d show me how, too.”
“Well, don’t forget, the secret to good ugali is to wait until the water is hot, and stir in the meal with a straw whisk. I’ll give you one if you don’t have one.”
“Thanks, Auntie, that would be great. Mom will be grateful.”
She wandered through the market, feeling the energy of the shoppers, fresh from sleep, not yet worn down by a long  day working in the heat. And something else — a comfort, an ease that came from the familiar. It was the same feeling she got from her father when he was among his countrymen. The feeling that so easily could turn to discomfort and unease with each other when Kenyans and Chinese came together. She wondered how to change that. Could it be changed?
Her musings were interrupted by the site of Musa, the halaal butcher.
“What brings you out so early, Milima?”
“I wanted to be sure you still had goat.”
“You are going to surprise your father?”
“Not unless you have Chinese moon cakes. Goat, that would not be a pleasant surprise for him. No goats in China, you know. No this is for my mother. I’m going to make her nyama choma.”
“Oh, she will love that. Make sure you get the right wood for the barbeque grill,” Musa said, and proceeded to give her a long series of tips on how to make the best nyama choma.
As she walked back up Serena Road toward the ocean, she could sense people behind the doors awake now. Behind her, the native district smelled of mandazi doughnuts and chapati bread, heavily milked chai and coffee. In front of her, the Chinese quarter was full of congee, steamed buns and tea. She could feel the contentment that everyone in all directions had as they ate their first meal. So many ways to the same happiness, so easy to mistake the food for the satisfaction it brought.
She had a brief flashback of espresso  and corn muffin with Raefe. It made her happy, but she had to laugh imagining them sitting in a tea shop in Shanzu. People would be thinking, “My, she’s Chinese and African. He’’s white. Seems like they’ve got the whole world covered.” And then some! If they had a kid, they could get it a T-shirt: “I’m one quarter Jewish, too.”
Well, they’d burn that bridge when they came to it. If only.

            <Title>The fruit of the tree</Title>
            <Text>The fruit of the tree
Diver was nervous and happy at the thought of a quiet dinner with Far Flier. Her contact with Raefe and Lina had revealed immense progress for both of them. She hoped Far Flier would see this as the beginning of regaining their mission. Telling him would be a way to demonstrate that she had put her reservations about his behavior aside without him having to apologize or her having to admit she had been hasty in doubting his motives. If neither of them could claim the high ground, at least they could gaze toward it together as friends and colleagues.
She looked around her apartment and sent it an image of the space without the front wall, extending the floor out over the canyons below in a sort of patio. At the edges, she thought of a low curving wall with a spongey covering that the two of them could sit against and look at the sky. She realized she was thinking of the dinner in a romantic way and that she wasn’t even surprised. Feathers as Green as Third Spring Grass had been right, of course. She and Far Flier had become a couple around the time she had taken the Earth assignment. But they had been casual about it. She had slowly explored him against the backdrop of her excitement about leading the Earth mission. And he had been willing to keep things that way.
Since the incident with Lina, their time together had been strictly work related. But she realized that she missed even their loose arrangement. Did he? she wondered. But her thoughts were interrupted with the sensation of Far Flier approaching. He wanted to know if her balcony was still the way she had left it the last time he was there. She let him see the changes she had made, and he seemed pleased.
Half a minute later, she could see why. He had chosen to fly to her. She didn’t even know he had a flight suit. He swooped down and landed gracefully on the deck, his purple and green colors glistening through the tight mesh of his flight suit.
“Ah, what a glorious day!” he exclaimed. “I’ve been to the Rannikan Hills. This week, the sky is full and you can see the amala herds gathering for their annual mating.”
“It’s been forever since I saw that,” she said. “Were the seven-fruit trees blooming also?”
He smiled. “See for yourself.”
He pulled a sack from a pouch in the suit. There were two of each of the seven fruit. “I hoped you haven’t made dinner yet.”
“No,” she said. “And this will be much better than what I had been thinking of. I didn’t know you were a forager.”
“Now and then. Gliding over the Hills, scanning for food, it has a way of clearing the mind.”
She was delighted. Restaurants sometimes served the seven courses of fruit, but to have them fresh-picked during a full sky, the only time these trees produced all seven types of fruit, was a rare treat. She began to let him sense her gratitude, but realized a better way. She cooed the call that ancient females had used to signal their approval of mating displays.
Far Flier laughed. “I haven’t heard that in hundreds of years.”
“I won’t ask what the last occasion was,” she said. “We should eat them in the ritual order that our ancestors did to thank Red Nest and Water Eye for shining more of Prime’s light, causing the trees to bloom and flower. And I’ve asked the kitchen to make some asterflower wine to go with them.”
“Excellent!”
They made small talk during the meal, not wanting to distract from the sublime and different flavors each fruit offered. They let each other sense their contentment. So they had survived their conflict over Lina. But how would things be different? she wondered.
“Thanks so much for bringing these,” she said when they had finished the last of them. “Very few people understand my love for unenhanced experiences.”
“Very few people have had them, I’m afraid,” he responded. “After thousands of years, our own people have grown dismissive of their ancestors. They discount them as foolish primitives. They think our progress has come through enhancements alone. And I’m afraid that is true throughout the Guardians of all species. Most of us have crossed a threshold where we are so intimately related  to each other that we are always empathetic. We would never revert to the violence of past eras. But we’ve come to credit our enhancements for that, not our entanglements, which we created originally without enhancements.”
“You have a wider view then me,” she said. “You interface with so many people on and off world. But I see what you say in my students. Recently, I let them experience a bit of life as Raefe does and that is just how they responded. I had to point out to them that their low opinion of humans was exactly the kind of thinking they accused the humans of. I hope I can help them elevate their shame into empathy. Ironically, the humans are just starting to do that themselves.”
She told him about Lina’s discovery of the Citizens of Nowhere.
“This band of refugees has already left behind the worst practices of their civilization without any help from us. They are all very close to being able to entangle. Lina’s presence alone may help them cross that line.” 
“You may be right,” Far Flier said. “Strong entanglers can set off a cascade of further entanglement.”
“Hmm. So maybe if Raefe was with her, they’d have a more profound effect on those around them?”
“Yes, most likely. And vice versa — Raefe’s abilities still need further development. Being together, in a sympathetic environment, all of that raises the odds that they can ultimately initiate a durable waveform that other people can tune into. More and more will add to it, and if humans repeat the pattern of other species, within  a few centuries humans will have left behind the era when they could not really understand each other, and therefore, not really overcome their differences.  But that is still a long way off. What is he doing now?”
“He’s involved with a research project that’s trying to understand the relative role of competition and collaboration in human history.”
She explained the complicated commercial arrangements that had led to his assignment as best she could. Far Flier seemed pleased at how things were going.
“Well, all things considered, they’re both in a much better place to have a significant influence,” he said. “All the more reason for us to not make too much noise in the council about what is going on.”
“So it’s come to that?” she asked.
“Yes, for the time being,” he answered. “I’m still trying to figure out what Hanikori’s end game is.”
The thought sobered her.
“I guess I can accept that we cannot be totally open,” Diver said. “But it’s a new feeling for me. Our whole lives are nearly transparent — we share our very thoughts and feelings. Still I want to tell you that I did something with Raefe and Lina like what your did with her.”
“What do you mean?” he asked, a little alarmed.
“Raefe was sent a message that Lina had been kidnapped. He desperately wanted to contact her, but he has never initiated an entanglement with another human, let alone one on the other side of the planet. And she has never been entangled with another human either and barely knows how to use her newfound abilities. So I connected them — I advanced their development.”
“Well, I wouldn’t beat yourself up about it,” he said. “It was only a matter of a little time before they figured that out.”
“Yes, just what I thought,” she said. “But I feel like I have lost something here, some sense of order and rightness by violating our code.”
“If it makes you feel better, I feel the same. The truth is, we have lost exactly that.”
“So how are we different, let alone better, than Hanikori, if we also break the rules?”
“We are not better,” he said. “The entire basis of our civilization and of the Guardians is just that. There is no ‘better’ among living creatures. There is, however, different. And that can only be measured in outcomes — what world do our actions make?”
“But that is why we have rules, isn’t it? Because we have experienced terrible outcomes brought on by certain actions, and so we say ‘never do that again.’”
“Yes, we do. We say that to children. And when they grow up, they discover that sometimes following the rule threatens also to lead to terrible outcomes. And then, they must weigh the consequences.”
“But I don’t know the consequences,” she said.
“Yes, with all of our technology, our accrued wisdom, our success at survival, life still humbles us after all. We have to guess at things and do the best we can. There is no scientific reason to believe we will ever know the future before it happens.”
“Still, the whole business upset me. The humans have a saying,” she said. “’Rules are made to be broken.’Perhaps that is what they mean by it.”
“Your humans are not the barbarians Hanikori would like the council to believe,” he said. “His experiences with them were as much about his own failings as theirs.”
“I wondered that, too,” she said. “Green told me that Hanikori’s contacts turned out to be deeply flawed. How could he mistake sociopaths for empaths?”
“Because secretly he believes that our abilities and knowledge have transformed us into demi-gods. And he mistook the sense of apartness that sociopaths have for a sense of aboveness.”
She had no words for this. She let him sense her shock and horror, her confusion that one of the leaders of their society and of the Guardians was potentially insane. After 10,000 years, how could this happen?
 “We are only atoms and ideas. This is the lesson of history and of the Guardians. We are imperfect organic machines, given to paradox and mistake. And the universe? It may obey the laws of physics, but those very laws yield all the chaos and violence of a supernova, not just the beauty of the sunset we are looking at now.”
Diver said nothing. She leaned back against the spongey wall, wishing she could bottle the beauty of the many-colored light and use it to clean away some of the ugliness of life. She knew Far Flier was watching her, feeling her unease.
“The light is comforting, isn’t it?” he said. “I feel that same need. Now you see the depth of my dilemma. Think of how shocked you are. You believe me because, well, for many reasons. But will the other Guardians? And our own society? Ultimately, I believe they will, and we will be able to undo the damage,” he said, his usual determination infused by a passion she had not heard from him before. “But the coming years will test us. We must be skillful, on the one hand, and yet not let the conflict make us into what Hanikori has become.”
“Have you found other allies?” she wondered.
“Yes, but not as strong as you.”
She cleared her mind and looked at him. In that instant, she realized that he was telling her, as best he could, that he needed her. That he depended on her youth and her freshness. That these battles he had been waging in secret by himself had taken a toll on him.
“I am honored that you want to fly into a strong wind with me on your wing.” she said. “Just as you depend on me to have the spirit and energy to carry on, I depend on you to have the insight and experience to know the way. But I will fly these currents with you, if that’s what you are asking.”
And, she thought, I see that he meant that but more, too. Not just to fly, but to nest. She responded, humming to encourage him. He stepped forward and his arms enveloped her, as the wings of his ancestors would have during courtship. She put her head against his chest and hummed the mating song.
He smiled. “What a lovely song you sing!”
She told the room to close the outside wall. Her bed, a modern abstraction of an ancient nest, extended from the inner wall and the lights brightened, as if the sun were shining on them. She shrugged off her clothes, letting all of her colors shine in the brightness, watching as he did the same.

            <Text>Secret experiments
December 13, 2048
Hanikori had picked the location with great care. On the slopes of the only active volcano on Traveller’s Perch, there was an ancient lava tube. Deep at the bottom, boiling lava sent hot air out of a vent at the top. Nearly invisible until you were right in front of it, there was a small chute that lead to the vent, just large enough to enter. The shape of the tube prevented too much heat from entering it. But the entire area was filled with masses of swirling ions generated by the lava below. There was so much quantum activity that most Guardians could never penetrate the static to entangle with him, let alone an ordinary citizen. 
Hanikori, on the other hand, had made a study of quantum noise and perfected his own filtering techniques. So the cave was safe from prying minds. Still, he trusted no one.
“Green, prepare a quantum key for this meeting. No one must know what we are discussing.”
All 17 of them absorbed the four-dimensional construct that will allow them to converse in isolation, their waveform impossible to comingle with any others without their knowledge.
“This meeting couldn’t come at a more crucial time,” Hanikori said. “The most naïve of the Guardian ambassadors, Diver, has gone beyond her usual silly projects — recently she had cadets catch fish in their teeth — and is now revealing herself to the barbarians of Earth. These are nothing more than killers, and yet she has blinded herself to their natures.”
“What of it, Hanikori?” Putnomo, a large quadruped from one of the farthest Guardian worlds, interrupted. “Let her waste her time while they destroy themselves.”
“You are many light years from them,” Hanikori answered. “We are only 20. She may already be breaking her oath and leaking technical information to them. I believe her objectivity may be compromised.  If she persists, in a millennia or two, they may well develop the means to threaten not only us, but other nearby species.”
“Hanikori, you are a politician and you excel at the age-old craft of frightening the populace. I am a scientist,” Putnomo said. “Earth  could not become a threat to us in ten millennia, even if they survive.”
“Are you willing to bet the future of all life on that, Putnomo?” Green interrupted with disgust. “Perhaps you won’t feel so complacent when you learn that Far Flier suggests you must make do with less energy for your lightspeed engine development. When he tells you the energy is needed to continue shifting humans to timelines where they haven’t yet blown themselves up, you will surely reconsider.”
 “Enough,” Hanikori thundered, the waveform vibrating with his intensity. “Let us not forget our purpose today.”
“Thank you,” Putnomo said. “Whatever our differing opinions about Diver and Earth, we can all agree that the most important thing is to press ahead with our work on e12.”
Only they knew that e12 was the latest iteration in the top-secret research they had been carrying out for more than a thousand years. 
 “I have excellent news to report,” Putnomo said. “About 600 years ago, we Guarded a very unusual species on the outer edges of the Eta Carinae nebula. It was the only life, let alone intelligent life, that we have ever found that was composed of only organized gas and plasma. We learned very little about it before Eta Carinae erupted in a partial nova that destroyed the region. For those of you who are new to our efforts, it was this encounter that started Hanikori and myself and a few others to realize that with some effort, this kind of life could be immortal.
 “Three things had to be solved to make that happen. The first – reducing an individual’s consciousness to free-standing waves ––– is already something all of our species could do, if we had not bound ourselves foolishly to retain our ancient forms. The second was how to overcome entropy – how can a waveform, in essence, eat while still retaining its essential nature? The third was how to continue to manipulate matter while remaining pure energy.”
Hanikori could hardly contain his impatience. Putnomo was always so impressed with himself. “Yes, yes, but what have you learned recently?”
Putnomo let them see his laboratory, hidden by a cloud of comets. Inside was a force field in which only a large plasma cloud existed, suspended by intense magnetic fields. They watched as Putnomo donned a helmet on his homeworld, nearly a billion kilometers away. For a few seconds nothing happened and then Putnomo allowed them to entangle with the plasma cloud itself, through him. And then he broke his connection with them.
The waveform shuddered as they all gasped. The plasma cloud retained much of Putnomo’s consciousness. In fact, it shifted gradually as they entangled with it.
Putnomo reconnected with them. “Yes, I was able to project my consciousness into the cloud, and while it couldn’t think entirely new thoughts, it did react to you in small ways. For the first time, we have created consciousness in a cloud of plasma.”
The waveform pulsed with approval and delight. Even Hanikori was impressed.
“Are there fundamental issues you still need to address?” he wondered.
“Not fundamental ones, no. We have some decades of engineering before we can attempt a full transfer, and then perhaps some more time to ensure stability. But there is every reason to believe that we have found a way to preserve consciousness for all time. In short, to be immortal.”
“And what about the third obstacle,”  Green asked. “Does any of this bode well for addressing that?”
“We have been working in parallel on that. We chose the confined plasma precisely because we have known for millennia how to control it. It was one of the main technologies of the controlled fusion era. Reversing that, having the plasma control ordinary matter, is challenging but conceptually well understood.” Putnomo was in all his glory now. “I feel strongly that we are perhaps 100 years away from a demonstration combining conscious energy capable of controlling material objects.”
Hanikori steered them back to the immediate threat. “All the more reason to not waste time or resources on foolishness. The lightspeed engine project is our cover story, and we need to keep the project alive, even if it’s mostly fake.”
“What is your proposal?” asked Putnomo.
Hanikori hesitated. He wasn’t interested in fully revealing his plans. “For now, we should all exercise vigilance over this ridiculous project with the humans. And we must lay the groundwork for us to turn the Guardians from the  fostering of any kind of conscious life to the further development of all of our species, who are the highest form of consciousness.”
“What is at stake,” he continued, “is nothing less than the evolution of conscious life itself. In a million millennia, only 20 species have in the entire galaxy have reached the stage of enhanced life. Should we spend another billion years hoping to find a few more? And leave ourselves vulnerable to forces beyond our control? To the whims of supernovas and their gamma ray beacons? To attack from far corners of the galaxy, or from beings in other galaxies who have gone beyond us in lightspeed travel or solved the riddle of faster than light travel?”
“We have earned immortality, and we deserve it,” he said forcefully. “Let us turn the Guardians from this foolish philosophy of naïve benevolence to one of true Guardianship – of our species, and our future.”
The meeting was over, and Hanikori felt minds drop away. But Green lingered.
“Are you not concerned about this development with this Raefe?” he asked. Hanikori was being unusually eliptical about it.
“I am quite concerned,” Hanikori said. “But I have a plan.”
“Care to share it?” Green asked. “We’ve been in this together for a long time.”
“And we will share a victory toast. Soon. For now, the most good you can do is to keep an eye on Diver. She is such a foolish being. She will be an important unwitting ally.”

            <Text>TechTown
February 8, 2049
The train glided to a stop in TechTown, with it’s 40-story glass towers towering over  Cambridge. Several heads jerked upright, their Voices telling them through their fashionably discrete ear implants that it was time to wake the frick up and get off the sooty train and head to their jobs. Shiny little office nerds, nervously tapping their eyeglass puters on. Must check those messages, wouldn’t want to have to look at all the grimey losers on the train.
Raefe couldn’t afford such fancy gear. Plain old flesh-colored skingel minibuds would have to do on his codetech salary. Right now, he was near the bottom of the food chain: a CodeEngine jockey who operated the software that MiniWorlds used to churn out application code. If he proved himself, he could move up to design and build the software that ran the CodeEngine clusters. Then from there, he could become a softsystems architect, helping design the complex EvoEco virtual ecosystem that evolved all the codes to work together to get anything done. Then he could think about invisible implants, or actually moving to the top floors of those 40-story towers, with their views of the harbor to the East, and the low hills landward. Right now, he was happy enough to look out of his own apartment at the building next door.
Or I could stop chasing this foolishness because I know it will all be under water someday if the world doesn’t smarten up. Someday in my life, not some far distant future in a scifi vid.
And find Lina. Their online exchanges left him aching for her. Not just for the pleasure of her sex. Somedays not even mostly for that. But for the pleasure of their comfort together. For the deep letting go that his body remembered more than his mind. Now even the sight of her words on the screen triggered those memories, and made him long for more.
That would have to wait. He had reached his workstation. There was already a good number of work orders waiting for for him. The usual crap: build a socket for input A to plug into module B, turn a fixed input into a user-adjustable one, and so on. CodeEngine had already downloaded all the parts he would need, but he needed to do some research to find out the full context the code would be used in before deciding exactly which variants of the parts, and in which order, he should use. 
The morning went by on autopilot. He worked through his usual espresso break and dispatched his to-do list and sent the results off for testing. The part of him that had survived the tidal wave did better in the mornings. As the day wore on, he grew restless with the routine, so he had taken to front-loading his day with work and rewarding himself with an actual lunch break. No more sipping smoothies at his desk while working. MinWorlds didn’t care, as long as they could keep feeding their sim frameworks to their customers, who turned them into finished sims, games, courses or whatever.
After lunch, he would have the results and could make corrections and do final tuning and optimizing. He looked across the wide expanse of the office where all the CodeEngine jocks sat. Nikko was heads down, the furrowed brow she got when she was deep inside the machine. Herbie was leaning back, arms folded, contemplating the screen — the thoughtful face he used when thinking about non-work items. Roderick was doing that thing with his hands where he would held them high above the keyboard, and hit a key at a time with a motion like he was conducting an orchestra. He always did that when he sent his code off to the test queue. So, at least two for lunch. He sent them a word bubble to meet at 12:10 on the water walk.
Raefe wandered out there, soaking up the early spring rays. He was looking for the Ethiopian food truck — close as he could get to Lina. He got a plate of chicken wat and some bread and walked over to the part of the water walk that jutted further out over the harbor. He grabbed a table big enough for three and waited for Herbie and Rod.
What were they thinking when they built this, he wondered. In 10 or 20 years, this could be underwater. Why didn’t they spend the money to build a solar farm or rebuild the grid or anything that would forestall the rising seas? Instead of a nice lunch place for software builders.
“Hey, you look deep in thought,” Herbie said. “What’s up?””
“Oh, nothing,” he said. “Just thinking how life is short on time and long on bullshit.”
“OK, then,” Herbie said. “Is that from your upcoming book, ‘Raefe Speaks?’ You have been very philosophical lately.”
“I guess so,” Raefe said. “No one told me that building grunt code would not only make me unrich, but deeply wise. They really should include that in the job posting.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Herbie said. “Seems like so many jobs offer a life of enlightened poverty.”
“What?” Rod said, just sitting down. “Poverty? What do you know about that? You should come with me next time I visit my family in Nigeria.”
“It’s all relative,” Herbie said. “What you’’re used to.”
“Right,” Raefe said. “Herbie, you’re used to whining. Rod,you’re used to reminding us all that you grew up where oil sludge goes to die.”
“And you,” Rod said. “What are you used to?”
“Eating lunch with you two, so that I can soak up the full range of human experience.”
Talk turned to work — which supervisor was the biggest jerk, which single women were at least semi-hetero, which of them might be desperate enough to consider a fellow CodeEngine jock as a sex partner, and so on. Raefe started to tune out during the sex talk — he had lost interest in pursuing the usual suspects in favor of figuring out how to reunite with Lina. Something Rod said kicked off a series of recollections from other Raefe.
“Hey, not to break up this highly enlightening discussion of relationship building techniques, but I’ve been meaning to ask you Rod, where again are you from in Nigeria?”
“Ikorodu. It’s near Lagos.”
“Right. And why would I have heard of it before I met you?” Raefe asked. Something from his other self had been tickling the back of his mind about Nigeria, but he couldn’t quite reach it to scratch.
“You probably heard about the whole mess there with development. The government had this grand plan to create a floating city on Lake Lagos that was connected to Ikorodu. With Lagos having over 30 million people, the government wanted to build housing to relieve that congestion and Lagos is not far away.”
“But they messed up?” Herbie asked.
“It was a disaster. Corruption, bad engineering, ethnic conflict — it all came together around this plan.”
“Were you there when it happened?” Raefe asked, now curious.
“Most of it, yeah,” Rod said. “Truth? It’s still going on.”
Something clicked for Raefe.
“Somebody told me about a guy who was trying to stop it — Goodstuff Benjamin. Ever hear about him?” he asked.
Rod laughed. “Goodstuff? Everyone knows about him. Everyone has an opinon, too.”
“No kidding,” Raefe said. “I didn’t know he was such a big deal. What’s your opinion?”
“Complicated,” Rod said. “Goodstuff, he has the right idea. In Nigeria, corruption and screwing up the environment are almost the same thing. In the old days, it was just take the oil and run. Then the big global agripharm companies realized that Nigeria was one of the best places in the world to both get oil and grow crops. So they could integrate the whole chain: take the oil, make fertilizer, genetically modify crops for higher yields. The generals were very happy to help. But Goodstuff’s followers, they were the losers in the process. Their land suddenly had oil wells on it and their water was polluted. Their farms were stolen for a pittance by Monsanto Takeda. They can’t even buy seed anymore without having to buy engineered seed, and that means they have to buy the enzymes to activate it, and they can’t afford that.”
“But?” Raefe said, sensing there was another side.
“Goodstuff is a talker, “ Rod said. “He’s like the preacher on Sunday. He tells you about the promised land, but somehow, you can never quite reach it. And the generals got sick of his preaching, and they chased him back into the forests in the North. Up there, the jihadis are after his ass, too.”
“Good taste in enemies,” Herbie said.
I feel like I have to meet this guy, Raefe thought, but how? How was he going to find a guy who was basically hiding from fanatical warlords in rural Nigeria? Maybe Lina would have some ideas. And even though he knew that Nigeria was quite far from Kenya, it was certainly closer to her than Boston. He was going to have to find a way to cross that ocean.

            <Text>The Big Meeting
February 3, 2049
Far Flier had never felt the waveform so volatile at a Guardian Council meeting. It wasn’t the number of participants that made it so difficult to tune everyone in. Aside from himself, there were only representatives from the five departments—— Green from Timelines, Hanikori from Administration, Putnomo from Discovery, Tanoch from Ambasssadors and Manulo from Analysis — plus Diver, summoned to explain events on Earth. No, the difficulty was in finding a wave that encompassed the full range of emotions that were brought to the meeting. He felt fear, arrogance, sadness, puzzlement, anger, gloating — not much to build resonance on. Disagreement was common among all peoples, and certainly the Guardian Council, but this was more. It felt like a will to avoid agreement, as if it were some ancient virus.
“Our task as a council,” he began neutrally, “often involves difficult, even impossible, dilemmas. Our tradition has always been to stare these directly in the face. To brave the complications they entail, to find the solution that is most faithful to our principles and our mission. I ask for your help now in coming together to discuss the matters at hand. We have two key issues in front of us. One is the recent crisis on Earth — what happened, what was done, and what should come next. Two is the proposal from Discovery to launch a new initiative, a project aimed at developing a lightspeed engine. Let’s start with Earth.”
As soon as he had acknowledged the lightspeed engine project, the waveform had begun to coalesce more firmly. So this is what they really want, he thought. Why the emotion attached to it?
“Representing Timelines,” Green started, “I want the Council to understand that at least one timeline shift was made without our participation. We know from past experience that any number of bad things can happen when this ability is used without proper care. That is the entire reason that Timelines was created as the newest part of the Guardians. Was it an Ambassador who initiated this shift? And can they explain why?”
“No Ambassadors are trained enough to accomplish a shift,” Tanoch replied, “even if we were so inclined. What evidence do you have that it was an Ambassador?””
“I received a request from Diver for a suitable timeline,” Green said. “And not long after, the shift was made.”
“Diver?” Tanoch asked.
“Green is correct,” Diver said, “but his account is incomplete. I made an initial query because I was concerned that Earth’s general situation was deteriorating. I wanted to begin thinking about alternative Earth’s for my contacts. Green gave me some insight into those options.”
“And I warned you against trying to send your contact into his past to relive his mistakes,” Green said.
“Of course. And I made it clear that I was not interested in that. But you are wrong to say that you did not participate in the shift.”
“Nonsene,” Green fired back. “We had nothing to do with it.”
 “Precisely. The situation was dire,” she said. She broadcast the records of the volcanic collapse and the tidal wave. “I had only a short time to rescue Raefe or his consciousness would have died with him. You were made aware of this.”
“Diver is correct,” Manulo interjected. “Analysis confirms both in her assessment of the situation on Earth and in what she told Timelines.””
“And what was the response from Timelines?” Far Flier asked, leaving it vague whether he was addressing Manulo or Green.
“I received no request from them for more information,” Manulo replied. “Typically, that would be the first step in planning a shift.”
“Because no shift had been authorized by the Council,” Green said. “I can only carry out the will of the Council.”
“But you knew there wasn’t time for that,” Diver said.
“I knew you didn’t have time for that,” Green said, “but whose fault was that? You had already anticipated that a shift would be neccessary, yet you never bothered to inform the council.”
“A good Ambassador always considers many potential outcomes,” Tanoch said.
“Yes, precisely,” Hanikori said, “and prepares for them.”
“You misunderstand my meaning,” Tanoch said. “If every Ambassador came to the Council every time they saw that the potential for a time shift had risen to a level where it was worth thinking about, we would be in constant session. I think the record suggests only that Diver was correct in her assessment. None of us can predict the future, only see vaguely the shape it might take.”
“Let us rise above the level of petty disputes about the facts,” Far Flier said. “The facts  are not in dispute. Diver made a request to Timelines, and Timelines answer was to follow procedure. Do we all agree on that?”
He could sense the frustration from some of the Council who had come hoping to discredit Diver, but no one objected to his characterization.
“So the question before us,” he continued, “is whether Timelines was right to stand on principle even if the outcome was disastrous. Especially when that principle was essentially a bureaucratic one.”
“You say that as if acting to shift the contact could not also bring disaster,” Green said, unyielding. “Let me remind you of the Orion disaster, when certain Guardians caused the collapse of an entire civilization across many timelines by repeated shifts without considering the consequences or even stating clear expectations of what they hope to accomplish.”
“Yes, we are all familiar with that unfortunate incident,” Far Flier responded. “That was why, 150,000 years ago, Timelines was founded. Tanoch, did Diver’s training not include the lessons learned from Orion?”
“It most certainly did,” Tanoch said. “And I can feel that you are going to ask whether her actions in this case could have initiated such a spiral. My answer is no. The key feature of the Orion incident was that the Ambassador involved develop a method whereby he would direct his contact to a certain course of action. If it did not work, he would analyze the shortcomings, shift the contact to a very similar timeline and then direct him to a refined course of action based on the past failing. Ultimately, the Ambassador fell in love with his own analysis, which was on its own incorrect, and inadvertently  directed his contact to repeat this in ever more effective  ways. The contact, instead of becoming an agent for progress, became the chief architect of a conflict which, once started, could not be stopped and rampaged on for centuries. In the end, the species wound up destroying itself.”
“And I understand that,” Diver said. “Raefe was merely a victim of a natural disaster brought on by centuries of inaction. The only thing he has learned is that Armageddon is a real possibility.”
“Yes, Armageddon is a real possility for all civilizations, even our various ones,” Far Flier said. “And that is why our nurturance of humans is important, more important than our own rules. Our mission is to create the conditions for intelligent life to prosper and survive. Whatever inconveniences, messy situations, loose ends or confusion that brings, we must always keep that foremost in mind. I would hope that in the future, Timelines would adhere to that mission.”
Green remained silent.
“Fortunately, Raefe has been relocated to a more advantageous timeline. Diver, you have entangled with him. What are his prospects?”
“Good, I believe,” Diver answered. “He is a bit disoriented. His situation is actually more stable: he has a job, decent housing. I’ve been talking to him about second chances. The notion that his second chance is also a second chance for his species. I am expecting it will take some months, maybe a few years, before he is able to translate that into meaningful actions. My plan is to encourage him to seek out others who he might join with. He is not a charismatic leader on his own.”
“Hang on,” Hanikori interrupted. “How did you shift him without the cooperation of Timelines?”
Diver hesitated. “I didn’t…”
“I did,” Far Flier interjected. “Analytics had made me aware of the crisis. Once Diver told me of the issue with Timelines, I took the necessary steps.”
“How interesting,” Hanikori answered. “I was unaware that anyone but Timelines could actually access the quantum multiverse interface needed to shift someone to a new timeline. In fact, in Administration, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that each department is compartmentalized, so that no Guardian can hijack the system for their own agenda.”
“I am surprised to hear you say that,” Far Flier answered. “You know that as Coordinator, I have the ability to access any systems. Perhaps you were unaware that in my early days in the Guardians we still practiced a system of rotation for trainees. Most of you are aware that every so often I participate in your department’s work. I’m not sure how a Coordinator can function, really, if they remain completely ignorant of what we do as Guardians.”
“I will only register my concern, then, at your interference. A matter for another time,” Hanikori said.
Far Flier could feel the waveform oscillate between those who agreed with Hanikori and those who didn’t. There was no clear consensus. He was actually relieved that there wasn’t more support for Hanikori’s attempt to open the can of worms. He would be gracious and move on before someone thought to ask about Lina.
“Quite,” he said. “We have much to talk about with the second item, the lightspeed drive project.”
“Yes, indeed,” Putnomo said. Everyone had sensed his growing impatience. “You have received my brief. Let me summarize. Some preliminary work by the Science team has revived interest in lightspeed travel. We are exploring some very promising new physics that will unlock this possibility. Rather than having to accelerate toward lightspeed, with all of the energy consumption and relativistic effects that entails, this new physics points to instantaneous lightspeed.”
“Given that we have effective faster than lightspeed transmission of information through wormholes, what do you see as the benefit?” Far Flier asked.
“What if there was intelligent life that was just bad at entanglement?” Putnomo asked. “Perhaps that is even the more common scenario than being capable of it. We would never know about these species. But this new approach will allow us to contact such species, at the least.”
“Does the physics suggest that this work could lead to FTL drives?” Far Flier asked.
“It doesn’t rule it out,” Putnomo replied. “Still early days.””
“You foresee a program of exploration?” Tanoch asked. “What part of the galaxy could be reached within the lifetime of an enhanced being?”
“Most of it,” Putnomo said. “Direct contact with life anywhere in the Galaxy should be possible, coupled with instantaneous communications of results through the wormhole interfaces. The combination will be very powerful.”
“So you see perhaps robotic vessels conducting a survey?” Manulo asked.
“That would be for us to decide, but yes, that is one scenario. Right now, my concern is to get the project into prototype mode, to build a working small-scale engine,” Putnomo responded.
“Might I ask more about the physics?” Manulo said. “What is the basic principal?”
“It’s quite complex, really,” Putnomo answered. “I’m broadcasting some reference materials if you want to dig deeper. But the short answer is that we think that by combining advanced plasma control systems with vacuum energy modulation, we can instantaneously transform the plasma into very high levels of light pressure.”
Far Flier made a mental note to investigate the science more thoroughly. Putnomo’s description didn’t quite make sense and he felt skepticism from Manulo as well.
“What would you need from the council?” he asked Putnomo.
“The project will require a doubling of the energy budget and staff allocations for the entire Discovery department. It would mean a redefinition of our basic goals.”
“What you mean” Tanoch said, “is that you would shift your activities away from supporting the Ambassador’s mission, isn’t it?”
“No,” said Putnomo. “We would change what is available to the Ambassadors. Now they can merely entangle with a few individuals. This project will enable them to identify new species, and perhaps even someday, to go beyond this galaxy.”
“But until lightspeed technology actually works, and we can use it for the Ambassadors,” Tanoch pointed out, “you would essentially be allowing the current effort to stagnate, betting on a future replacement.”
“Unless our home worlds are willing to give greater support to the Guardians as a whole,” Putnomo answered. “That is not for me to decide.”
“Then I suggest that I ask each Guardian species to consider their stance on this,” Far Flier said. “Ultimately, they must decide what future direction we want to take as Guardians. I will proceed with that. When we know the answer, we can meet to discuss again.”
Both sides accept this, Far Flier thought. I wonder why.

            <Text>Winners and losers
March 3, 2049
It was a short bike ride from MiniWorlds to the MIT campus, but for Raefe it seemed like a huge step. He was the third generation of public education products in his family. MIT was the elite world, stuffed with corpo kids who’d been prepped in endless tech camps, by private tutors and private schools. They’d come to become the technical elite of the world in exchange for insane fees and perpetual contributions from their parents. Harvard might still churn out the CEOs and CFOs, but the Chief Officers of Technology, Science, Data, Genetics and the rest came out of here and CalTech and Carnegie Mellon and handful of other places like that.
It was exactly the place that had produced Ken Robertson, who ran DigiBrands, which owned MiniWorlds. Raefe had to remind himself that in this world Ken Robertson had not strong-armed the U.S. government into giving him most of the Northeast to pillage. Not yet, at least. But thinking about his other life in the days following the flood tempered his enthusiasm about venturing into the fold at the ‘Tute, as the students called it. Herbie liked to joke that it was really the Toot, as in tooting your own horn. Herbie collected 20th century insults, although he had a pretty good catalog of 21st century ones, too.
His puter guided him to the Laboratory for Computational Civics, a nondescript three story building tucked into the middle of the campus.
“Hi, is this the Civilization Project?” Raefe asked a rather harried looking woman.
“Yes, yes, and who are you?” she answered.
“I’m Raefe Epstein-Miller,” he said. “From MiniWorlds.”
“Oh, finally someone who can actually do work,” she said. “Everyone here is a big thinker. Very nice until you have to actually get something done. Well, you are in the right place. I’m Roshi Farzan, the team leader for the Outcomes team. You’ll be working with us. Come, I’ll introduce you.”
She took him into a large, messy room full of long tables littered with vid screens and various inscrutable gadgets. No one looked up. In his mind, he had envisioned something exotic — maybe inside a geo dome with vids on every surface. This looked like MiniWorlds if it held a high school science fair and all the robocleaners broke. But the visuals slowly gave way to a feeling of being caught in a stream with a surprisingly strong current. It wouldn’t knock you over, but you would have to mind your step.
He realized he was feeling the combined affect of a dozen very intent, focused and powerful minds in one place, thinking about related things. It was like being in a room full of Divers, except that they couldn’t read his thoughts or talk into his mind. Or could they? This will be fun, he thought.
He realized Roshi was smiling at him, bemused.
“They’re not so fierce,” she said. “They won’t bite.”
“No,” he said, “I was thinking more they will. Bite off big chunks of stuff and digest it. Not me — whatever they work on. I can feel that big brain energy.”
“Ah, that,” she said. “Not like where you work?”
“Not exactly,” he said. “Plenty of smart people. But we’re just allowed to eat the little chunks that we can spit out quickly into product.”
“Different product here,” she said. “Ours is insight — takes time and luck. Anyway, we need your help and I think you’ll find it engaging. Let me introduce you to your team members.”
Who were a guy named Jim and a woman named Elise. The four of them sat around a small table in the corner — the Lab’s version of a conference room.
“Elise works on quantitative sociology and Jim on simulation kinetics,” Roshi said. Raefe had no idea what that meant, but nodded. Not going to do the whole “I’m just a state school kid” thing,” he thought.
“What that means in this context,” Elise said, “is that I look at factors that have contributed to the rise and fall of societies — civilizations — and Jim develops math that represents those factors.”
“And what we’re hoping you’ll be able to do,” Jim said, “is translate that math into an interactive, game-like environment.”
“And why do you want to do that?” asked Raefe.
“Are you familiar with the Universal Standard Model sim?” Jim replied.
“A bit,” Raefe replied. “It’s everything we know about physics applied to a sim of the history of the cosmos. I seem to remember using it in science class in high school.”
“That was the public version,” Jim said. “The thing is, we don’t know everything about physics. So if you run the universe from the Big Bang to now, the sim will always violate something we already know as true or false unless you rig the sim. There’s a research version where astrophysicists can tinker with stuff, inject new variables, factors, particles and so on that they’re researching. And see if their presence or behavior gets us closer to reality.”
“I get that,” Raefe said. “That’s why anyone would use a sim. But why the game part?”
“Because CivLab is about people,” Elise said. “We want to be able, for example, to ask people to play through different phases of history and see how their behavior changes outcomes. And even interview them about why they did what they did. Some people even want to watch their brains as they play — how much of their actions are driven by logic, how much by emotion?”
“Cool,” Raefe said. “Well, I’m sure I can help. I’ve built dozens of game frameworks for hundreds of games and even some self-generating animated vids. We’ll have to get deeper into how you want them to interact, how many people and so on. But that sounds exciting. Most of the games I help build are either about guns or money — is that the kind of stuff you’re looking at?”
“Part of it. But we want to look deeper into issues like competition and collaboration, heirarchy and equality, scarcity and plenty. How does that effect the role of guns and money, for example, in how a society works?”
“Nice,” Raefe said. “I’m a little bored of creating counters for bodies or coins.”

Traveller’s Perch,
September 8, 2048
Far Flier was in a hurry to meet with the new class of cadets, but it would have to wait. He could feel Diver’s anxiety deepening, and he would have to go see her first. She was too deep into her link with Earth to fully convey her thoughts remotely, so he would just go to the Guardian headquarters and see what was up.
No wonder she had been unable to fully communicate with him. She was sitting motionless in the inner ring around the pulsing energy of the wormhole interface that was the heart of the Guardian’s galactic network, fully entangled with the humans she monitored. Most ambassadors connected to the interface from their homes or work sites, allowing them to attenuate the signal as needed. Always so conscientious, he thought with fondness.
The ozonish glow of the interface field highlighted the purple in her feathers. The sharpness of her beak, the way her arms looked poised for flight even when she was still, everything about her expressed the alertness that had drawn him to her. Fifty thousand years ago we would have soared together over the canyons of Traveller’s Perch, hunting for food, he thought, with not a little bit of desire to soar and swoop with her. Something gained, something given. At least we will have centuries to get to know each other.  He touched her mind lightly, politely, so as not to startle her.
“Aren’t you the diligent one,” he let her know. “Coming right to the source.”
“I didn’t really have a choice” she said, speaking out loud. “Earth is not exactly the strongest signal in the galaxy and I have to find Raefe’s mind. Something is happening and the wormhole interface is the best place to find it.”
“So what’s going on?” he asked.
“Well, there’s been an extreme storm on Earth that broke many of the walls they had erected to hold the rising seas back.  Raefe’s city was struck by a giant wave of ocean water. He was nearly killed, tens of thousands were. He and millions are homeless now.”
“That’s terrible! Is he injured?”
“No, but I don’t know how he’s taking it. And there’s more: I feel a surge from him — I think maybe the stress has strengthened his empathetic capabilities. Or possibly the opposite -- he’s always been a bit fragile, and the surge may have been a breakdown.”
“Well, I came at the right time. I wanted to get an update from you on Earth ahead of the Council meeting.”
“OK,” she said. “But just for a few minutes. I need to monitor things closely. And I’m just not sure everything coming from Earth makes it out of the interface into the waveform.”
He smiled at her dedication as a rookie ambassador. With time and experience she would become more relaxed and less reactive. As Guardians, they were more concerned about the sweep of history, less about the daily travails of the individuals and species they monitored.
“I’m sure Earth’s future will not be decided in the next few minutes,” he said. “You have a trainee, don’t you? Adno, as I recall. Ask her to monitor while we talk.”
She let him follow her thoughts to Adno, who seemed pleased to take on the task, but worried she was not up to it. Diver reassured her and they left the interface chamber for the tunnels that took them to cliff face outside of headquarters.
“It’s a full sky today,” he observed.
He felt the warm breeze that Prime’s light brought to them. High in the sky, Prime’s trinary mates, the Twins, shone like orange eyes against the red sky. Prime’s other two planets, Red Nest and Water Eye, shone like small yellow jewels on a head dress. The dance of these stars and planets drove the thermal cycle that all life on the planet lived by.
He felt contentment from Diver. He knew few people who derived as much satisfaction from raw nature as her, and it was one of the things that drew him to her.
 “Perhaps all this beauty will help to clarify our way forward,” he said. “Analysis Section thought that Earth showed a small yet definite promise that it may progress to Balance, where it would likely flourish. Should I be telling them that they may have been wrong?”
“No, in the long run they will be proven right,” she said. “But humans are still stuck in Optimization. Every problem they have, they try to invent a technology to solve. You can bet they’ll be discussing bigger sea walls now. Sometimes I wish I could yell through the interface ‘Look inside yourselves, the answer’s there.’ But on the plus side,  they belong to an order of animals that is predominantly social, able to accommodate a wide range of social structures, from small bands of less than 10 to herds of thousand. So they have that in their favor.”
“How does their genetics express itself in their ability to entangle?”
“Weakly, it would seem, although it’s hard to tell,” she answered. “I suspect that in the past they developed a very basic ability — they were able to colonize their entire world largely without the benefit of a common language, spoken or written. But for about 5,000 years, they have relied heavily on written language to organize elites in their society, and only in the last 200 years has written language become widespread outside the elites, and even then, not everywhere. And they have thousands of languages, although a handful are widespread. So as they’ve advanced technically, they’ve also had tugs pulling them apart, pushing them backwards in their social integration.”
“As happened with our ancestors,” he pointed out.
“Yes, I tell myself that, too,” she said. “But I think their Emergent phase was more extreme than ours. History is your passion -- what can you tell me about our beliefs in spirits during our Emergent and Optimization periods? The databases are hard to decode on that subject.”
“Well, I don’t think we need to figure that out just yet – I just need to give a preliminary report of your current findings. But for what it’s worth, twenty or thirty thousand years ago we believed that every kind of life was patterned after an invisible spirit that lived on Prime and flew here to lay eggs that became us or other kinds of life.”
“So how did people react when they learned Prime was a hot ball of gas and that there was a vacuum you couldn’t fly through between Prime and our planet? Or that Water Eye was inhabited by intelligent marine animals?”
He paused, letting his enhancements probe tens of thousands of years into databases of ancient histories. “Oh, right. At first there was some upset about it, but that discovery really launched us into a deeper understanding of physics. Ultimately that led to us discovering entanglement.”
“Hmm, Earth people went to their own moon and it didn’t have that effect, not totally. Wait a second --” 
He felt her mind slip away as Adno made contact with her. He could feel that she was mostly relieved by whatever news her trainee had for her.
“Sorry,” she said. “Adno wanted to let me know that he’s OK. He and his mate, Lina, have found a camp where they can eat and sleep for the time being. She confirms that his ability to entangle has become stronger. Adno suspects that as the shock of the flood wears off, he will also be less troubled by his abilities. We agree that he’s starting to come to grips with his empathic abilities for the first time. If we could just nudge that along…”
He looked at over the canyons, listening to whistle of the winds that traversed Traveller’s Perch. He felt Diver’s blend of hope and frustration but he wasn’t sure he had any advice. Perhaps he had been wrong to give her this species as her first assignment — if she failed because they were intractable, he knew she would take it personally. And maybe even blame him for giving her the assignment.
“Well, we are bound not to intervene too much. Soon, though, you may be able to contact him directly. In the meanwhile, you sit by the interface, what, hoping for a miracle?” he asked, hoping she understood that he was impressed by her effort. “As our friends on Water Eye say, ‘You can try to swim on land, but it won’t get any wetter.”
“Well, Earth’s not all that dry,” she joked. She sped through a litany of all the things she considered positives for humans. You have to love her enthusiasm, he thought. Or was it just that she was 400 years old and he was 1,200?
 “So what’s the crux of the issue here? What do I tell the Council is the indicator that we’re watching for movement?” he asked.
 “They have to make that breakthrough,” she said. “That moment when they learn to use their rationality to understand their irrationality. Their art is full of that, but they think of it as imaginary, not real. They’re like most other intelligent species, a blend of emotion and logic. But they think of those facets as opposites instead of complementary. That’s exactly what they need to shed, and begin to use their rationality to understand how to account for their irrationality.”
“Well, you seem to believe they can. Let’s just hope that humans do, too,” he said. “I knew you were the right person for this job. Most Guardians would have recommend abandoning this species to their own devices.”
“I can’t accept that they’re that hopeless,” she said, “Their abilities are buried — not nonexistent. If I sit in front of that interface I can sense the pure signal of a few thousand minds in that glow, unmediated by the interface network. It’s just extremely weak. But something very real is happening, even as we sit here. Hopefully, Raefe is not the only one being pushed forward by crisis. But I fear for them — their civilization is trapped in the classic spiral of decline. Those with the power to change things delude themselves and use their power to protect their own narrow interests. He’s just one person on a failing world.”
“Our work is hard,” Far Flier sighed. “We have failed with many species, and they’ve perished. Even when we succeed with a species, we always have to consider that at some later date they may revert and become a serious threat outside their own star systems.  But I sense that what troubles you most is the fate of this Raefe.”
“He has a hard life. He experiences his own gift as an affliction, and he sees himself as weak and useless.  
“Still, it’s a start for him and for you. Keep me informed. Next week is the Guardian Council meeting. At the very least, let’s talk about it there. Now I have to go.”
He hopped on the moving sidewalk that ran along the back of the cliff face and jumped off minutes later at the front entrance to Guardian headquarters. A’Nontans who weren’t involved with the Guardians sometimes congregated there — watching offworlders was a hobby for some of Traveller’s Perch’s natives. On all the Guardian worlds people enjoyed the culture of the other worlds, but the vast distances that separated their worlds meant that only a few dozen offworlders from the nearest worlds could make the decades-long trip to Guardian headquarters. Far Flier saw several familiar faces among those milling about and nodded to them.
Inside the entrance, the narrow hall flared and extended upward, like the inside of a gourd. The room had been designed so that a speaker standing near the narrow end would be heard equally by all inside, a throwback to the days when flocks of A’Nontans would congregate for song-drama and poetry festivals in which every voice had to be heard.
There were eight new cadets this year, but most of the staff turned out for these annual welcomings. The auditorium was packed.
“Good morning, new cadets,” Far Flier said. “And welcome to those of you who apparently have forgotten the speech that I give every year at this time, and came for a refresher.”
There was a low snicker from the audience. Far Flier rarely deviated from his set talk to the rookies. There was a small contingent at headquarters of Mintar, a mathematically oriented culture that loved gambling, and they ran an annual pool betting on how many new sentences there would be in his talk. The smart money had him at seven this year.
“And I will give a refresher of sorts,” he said. “I was intending to give my standard talk today, one I have honed over more than a century as the leader of the Guardian Council. And I will do some of that — it’s vital for you to begin with a firm understanding of our mission. Without that, the ensuing years you will spend acquiring our methods would be empty. And even our methods, it’s important to grasp their foundations and principles as well.
“But just this morning, something special and unusual happened and I think you will learn much from it. As you know, we seek to nurture emergent intelligent life. A few of you have such species on your own world, species that have evolved more slowly but now have all the hallmarks of intelligent life — abstraction, construction, complex social organization, and so on. But most of you have not had this experience. When we say ‘emergent intelligent life’ your enhancements will supply you with many facts and images of such species. But you will not know what their life really feels like to them. And if you don’t know that, you won’t be able to help them.
“Only a few hours ago, on a planet known to its inhabitants — the humans — as Earth, technologically driven warming caused fierce storms that created large waves in the ocean that covers three quarters of this world. These waves nearly killed a young man who is the strongest empath we have been able to discover on this planet. And for this emergent civilization, empathy is desparately required. The victims of these storms have now become the victims of their social system, bits of carrion to be preyed upon by the dominant members of their extended clan.
“And only a hundred or so meters from here, a Guardian ambassador has dedicated herself to helping this individual survive this crisis so that he has a chance to grow into a leader for his people. He has lost his home and is now a wandering migrant with thousands of others. He is at risk now, separated from the place and the social groupings that give his life context and a measure of protection. More than anything, he will feel disoriented because he has a strong need for connection that has been torn from its moorings.
 For the humans, an empath like this is as important to their future as the scientifically gifted were a thousand years ago. And this is where we make a difference. Does anyone know how?”
“Through connection?” ventured a spindly Javiranian.
“Yes, certainly,” Far Flier answered. “We connect, and in connecting, we bring the knowledge that connection is one of the deepest and most ancient qualities of life. To connect with naive individuals from species that only suspect that they are not alone in the universe, you will have to be practiced at it. You have all been born into a world filled with waveforms — your minds have always been connected with other minds in various ways.
“The human world doesn’t accept this as a general truth. Our human experiences his connections as an affliction. This crisis has pushed him forward. He now can sense the feelings of people around him. Later, perhaps, we will help him to go beyond that to the waveforms we enjoy — the vibrations that bring our thoughts to each other, that combined with our enhancements, give us a much richer experience of each other and of our species as a whole.
“To do that, you will have to master one of the two most important Guardian methods: entanglement.
“You have all learned the physics of entanglement. When the universe expanded and was no longer physically a single object, the force that connected everything in that primordial plasma remained a web throughout the universe, a web of quantum entanglement. We harness that to connect instantaneously by focusing energy through wormholes that bridge great spaces. This is how advanced species in our galaxy can connect, can be Guardians.
“On every world we have nurtured, we have found individuals who already have, usually unknown to them, great natural talents at connecting to that web of entanglement. Our young human is just such a person. People like him can take their species from an intellectual acknowledgment of how interdependent they are to a deep and functional understanding that will transform their worlds over the coming generations into something sustainable. Something beyond just achieving the technological ability to blow themselves up.
“Does that always work?” Low murmurs of “No” came from the cadets. “No, indeed. We have nurtured many species that were not able to cross that threshold to sustainable intelligence. What can we do to help them?”
“Send them back in time to start over,” replied a a burly tetrapod from Qualix.
“If only we could,” Far Flier said, smiling. “This is the most misunderstood of our two core capabilities. Our ability to entangle led us long ago to discover that our universe is really a multiverse. As the universe expanded, particles formed, and these particles existed in many simultaneous quantum possibilities, and each possibility created another universe. There are an enormous number of simultaneous universes, linked only by this web of entanglement. But they are only linked in the present, at the instant we connect.
“For millions of years after the Guardians were formed, we studied this phenomenon and were finally able to understand how to transmit and receive energy between these multiverses. And later, we learned how to transmit the energy that is a person’s consciousness to another part of the multiverse — a parallel universe, if you will — where they also exist.
“And that, my young Qualixian, is where the truth of your comment lies. We can send individuals to another present, to start over, to have a second chance. If any of you wind up working in our Timelines Department, you will learn how to map the many closely related universes that surround ours. You will learn how to assess which ones present the most favorable scenario, where self-destructive forces have coalesced a little more slowly, or where constructive trends have created more favorable conditions. And you will work with the ambassadors to transfer our contacts’ minds, the people we have entangled with, to those new timelines. They always retain some knowledge from their original universe, so they are able to act as change agents. But we cannot send them backwards or forwards in time. The universe forbids it.
“Well, I’ve gone on quite a bit. But it’s been a day that reminds me very powerfully of why we do what we do. That can be a rare gift; our work is patient and takes centuries to bear fruit. But when you see that we have the chance of a lifetime to help rescue an entire intelligent species from oblivion, it all makes sense. So welcome, and make the most of your time as a cadet. Ask all the questions you have. Give all the passion you feel.”

            <Text>Bad dreams
September 5, 2048

People are screaming all around him. He can’t see more than a few feet, but he knows something terrible is happening down near the harbor. He hears metal bending, then shredding. He hears water, lots of it, banging cars around, getting louder, drowning out the screams.
Raefe bolted awake, sweating, temples pounding as they always did when he had these visions. He started the deep breathing exercises the therapy app had given him. This must be the remnants of that hurricane, it’s just a storm. In, out, in and — why is the water getting louder? He can feel the screams of drowning people. He shook Lina.
“Get up! We have to get to the roof.”
He yanked her arm, pulling her up out of the bed. She grabbed at her Voice and they ran up the back stairs in their underwear, yelling “Wake up, get to the roof!” to the other residents of their three-container TinyStack, banging ferociously on the third-floor door as they run by. The water sound was loud now, they could barely hear their feet on the stairs.
They got to the roof, Kiko and Kayam right behind them. They bent into the wind, trying to see what was happening. Hurricane Fatima drove sheets of rain toward them. 
“Look!” Lina yelled over the wind. “The storm wall must be shot.” They can barely see that usual bright necklace of lights and gates that is the harbor sea wall, disappeared. Huge waves slammed the shore, cars tumbled like driftwood into buildings. The sea has already pushed the Mystic River fast over its banks, churning inland past the TinyStack.
Kiko pointed wordlessly off to the right. A small ship surfed a 30 foot wave, headed from Boston Harbor toward the Mystic Tobin Bridge. The ship twisted and for a minute it looked like it would pass under the bridge that towered 50 meters above it. Then the water threw the boat back into the farthest pillar. A mile away, they heard the sound of the bridge bending over the roar of the water. The pillar bent, twisting the whole bridge. The bending freed the ship and it continued on until it smashed into a building only blocks away.
The streets were 5 meters deep in sea water all around them and dawn was hours away. They look up at the elevated highway only meters above their TinyStack. They found a track for maintenance robots on the highway stanchion. They wedged their feet between the rails and climbed up. The meet a ragged column of survivors on Interstate 93. The rain is everywhere, there is no escape from its driving needles, but they turn their backs on the flood and march north, away from the harbor.
Raefe could barely look at the survivors, freezing, dressed in underwear, pajamas, blankets or nothing, footsteps silent in the wind and rain. His brain was wracked by a kind of lightning that brought a thunder of drowned screams. He put his hand on the back of Lina’s shoulder. His white hand was like a flashlight on her brown back, and he followed it through the rain. 
They get to the top of a big hill. Lina turns around and shakes him.
“It’s OK, we’re safe,” she says. “We made it.”
He nods and wonders, But when will the screams stop? 
They all turn and look back over East Somerville, now a drowned urban swamp. There are no more streets, just dirty water and short buildings like fat trees sticking out of it.
“So that’s what the apocalypse looks like,” Kayam said, his arms wrapped tight around himself.
“Yeah, where’s Jesus?” Lina answered, annoyed.
“No, no Jesus coming,” Kayam said. “Not like that. No free trip to heaven for the true believers. Look around — you telling me this isn’t the end of our world? You think we’re the only people right now standing on a hill looking at something like this?”
“Kayam, stop it,” Kiko said. “Now’s not the time. Come here.” She embraced him, sobs and tears leaking out of both of them.
“Sorry, K,” Lina said. “Didn’t mean to jump on you like that. You know how I am about all mumbo jumbo.” Kayam waves his hand as if to say, it’s OK, even if nothing is.
“There’s our TinyStack!  Over there.” Raefe said, pointing. He asks what no one has wanted to. “Do you think Miguel got out of the first floor?”
“No way,” Kayam said. “Water was already over back door when we got to the roof.”
“Rest in peace, Migs,” Lina said. “Sorry we didn’t have more time to get to know you.”
“Shit, Kiko,” Raefe suddenly realized, “Where’s your food trike?”
“Serving the fishes,” she said. “You’re going to have to find a new place to get Cubanos and Korean barbecue.”
“Starting to see your point, Kayam,” Lina said. 
Raefe stared at the only home he’s had since leaving his parents. From here, their little TinyStack just looked like bright painted shipping containers stacked under a bridge.
The first light of day brought a dull, gray shine to the city. Traffic was sparse. Lina’s Voice finally found the Net. She sent a text to her parents in Sofricar and gave her Voice to Raefe to call his family. In Raefe’s ear it’s loose, smaller than his, but he jams his finger in to make it work. He talked to it quietly, resetting it to work for him. The Voice took awhile, but it was able to get through to Vermont. 
“Dad, it’s Raefe. Just wanted to let you know I”m OK.”
“Hey, son, so happy to hear your voice. I’m seeing some crazy stuff on the Net — 10 million people homeless, no power to 100 million?”
“I don’t know, Dad. My ‘puters lost in the flood, we had to leave in a hurry. I’m using Lina’s Voice. We just walked all night to get out of the flood. We’re just standing on hill. I’m hoping some cops come by, or any one who knows where we should go.”
“It’s chaos, Raefe. They’re saying the government can’t even find its own people. Digi and Brightstar Defense and some other big corpos say they’re going to help. You know how that works — have a problem and call Brightstar for help, now you’ve got two problems.”
“It just keeps getting, worse, Dad.”
“I’m afraid so, son.”
“How’s Mom? How’s Benny?” He only heard silence. “Can you hear me?”
“Yeah. Raefe, I’m afraid I have some bad news. He was  working a fish ranch out off Stellwagen Bay. The boats that were supposed to get them off never made it. He’s gone, Raefe.”
“Oh, Dad, Benny’s gone?” Raefe couldn’t believe it. “What was he doing out there? I thought he was finishing up engineering school.”
“Well, he wanted to. But when your mom got the ultra-pneumonia, he signed on for a three month contract. Big bucks, he thought we could get her into a hospital.”
“Dad, this is so awful. I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine what you’re going through up there. How’s Mom taking it?”
“Honestly, I haven’t told her yet. At least now, I can tell her you’re alright. But she’s weak from the u-pneu. I’ve been keeping her meds up, getting them cheap from Mexico and Canada. But she needs a hospital.”
Raefe knew his father had a good contract writing code for Muskworks, but insurance wasn’t part of the package. Never was.
 “I want to help, Dad. I’ve been down in TechTown recently and I had a line on a full-time job before all this. Soon as this mess clears, let me see what I can do.”
“Well, we’ll talk when you get settled. I’m happy to hear that. I just don’t want to see you be a contract lifer like your old man.”
Raefe could see him, sitting in their apartment in the endless townhouse flats south of Burlington, staring out at the wind farms on the ridge. On the wall, the photo of Justin Miller and Charlotte Epstein holding newborn Raefe, little Benny looking up, standing in front of a brownstone in Brooklyn. He loved that picture. They’re smiling about their future. No one thought that The Slide was only months away. A secret US weapons test in space would cause a massive communications satellite failure. The Net would disappear for six weeks, tipping the creaky world financial system down the long incline it was still on.  Millions of Justins and Charlottes — billions around the world — would ever have a full time job again. Nor would they ever smile quite as effortlessly.
“My old man is that guy smiling with his girl in the picture on the wall,” he said. “Don’t forget that smile. You give Mom my love.”
“Will do. You take care of yourself. And say hi to Lina.”
Raefe turned to Lina and Kayam and Kiko.
“My dad says the Net is crazy with rumors. One hundred million without power, 10 million homeless. Corpos already feasting on the carcass. My brother was on some fool mission to save my mother — working some fish farm. He’s dead.”
He stood numb, feeling like a giant antenna receiving a million channels, all with bad news. Yesterday he was just another kid struggling to find work and keep it together. Today they were all human driftwood washed up on the new shoreline.

            <Text>Flood warnings
Truro Island, 
November 7, 2048

Diver was pleased with how the class had gone. Getting the cadets to be humble in the face of the many irritating and irrational aspects of unenhanced intelligence was neither easy or optional. She would have to return to that again and again, or risk having some of them dismiss the worth of the very species they were supposed to be guarding.
Her thoughts were interrupted by an urgent summons in the waveform.
“Diver, this is Manulo, from Information Analytics. Please give us your full attention.”
What could Information Analytics want? They monitored standard electromagnetic communications from all the worlds the Guardians monitored through the wormhole interface.
“Please focus on the stream from Earth,” Manulo instructed. “This information came through the wormhole interface network only minutes ago.”
News reports, satellite photos, military communications all arrayed in front of her. A volcano had erupted on the Isle of Surtsey, off the coast of Iceland. She understood immediately that Raefe might be in danger.
“Will it impact the area near one of our contacts, Raefe Epstein Miller?”
“Not the volcano. But Earth geologists say there is a 30% chance the volcano will cause an underwater landslide. Our simulations are more clear. The slide of part of the Greenland ice sheet into the ocean five years ago caused some upwelling of the tectonic plates. The earthquake that accompanies this volcano will almost certainly cause the eastward face of the island to shear off and fall into the ocean. The result will be a tidal wave over 50 meters high and it will move at a speeds close to 500 kilometers an hour.”
“He will be killed?”
“Yes, in less than three hours. While the area of destruction will be smaller than the recent hurricane, he will be in it and the destruction will be much more profound.”
“Please forward your summary to the Guardian council immediately.”
She contacted Green.
“My main Earth contact, Raefe, will be dead very shortly in his current timeline. Manulo has forwarded the situation. Can you identify an alternate timeline that we can transfer him to?”
“You know I can’t do that without authorization from the council.”
“No time for that. This is an extraordinary situation — a catastrophic earthquake and tidal wave.”
“I’m sorry, Diver, but the truth is that human-induced climate change is the aggravating factor here. You know I can’t authorize a timeline shift due to social factors without council approval.”
She disconnected, frustrated and angry. She felt Far Flier reaching out to her.
“I just heard from Info Analytics,” he said. “What’s the status?”
“We have to shift him to a new timeline. Fast. Green won’t give me a suitable timeline. Says the catastrophe is the result of human factors, and so the whole council has to approve.”
“Never mind that. I’ll explain to you later, but I’ve been worried about this all along. I’ve got a contingency plan. A new time line. You’ll have to prepare him though. Let me know when you’re ready.”
There was more going on here than she understood and no chance for her to consider all the variables. Nor could she get to the wormhole itself. She would have to focus extremely hard and cut through the noise. Raefe was stronger now, it should be easier. He was on an island, working. They had never connected while he was awake, but she had no choice.
She found his mind and assumed the Mars Girl image. He smiled.
“Hi, it’s me again. Don’t stop what you’re doing, don’t speak. I have important news to tell you and you can just think and I will know your thoughts.”
“Right, hello to you, too,” he thought. “What’s up?”
“You are in danger,” she said. “Your island will be hit by a massive tidal wave in the next few hours. But don’t be afraid. I have a way to save you.”
“Are you sure? You can tell that from 20 light years away?”
“Yes, there’s no doubt. When the time comes, you will wake up somewhere else.”
“What about Lina?”
“I’m not sure if she’ll be there. I’m trying to learn everything I can about what we can do, but we may not be able to save her, too.”
“Then forget it. She’s stood by me through so many things. I’m not leaving her. And I’d be lost without her.”
“Well, you wouldn’t be leaving her, in any event. It’s complicated and we don’t have a lot of time. Let me find out more about Lina. I’ll be right back.  It will be quick.”
She found Far Flier.
“He won’t leave Lina.”
“We could move him anyway.”
“I don’t think he’d ever cooperate with us again. And he could go insane. Is she in the timeline you have chosen?”
“Well, she’s alive, but she’s never met him,” Far Flier said. “She’s in Efricar, there’s never been a holocaust.”
“So she won’t have died, in his new world, but they will never have met. I don’t think that will be enough, though. He’’s dependent on her for emotional stability.”
“If we transfer her consciousness, too, and then tell them how to find each other, will he agree?”
“Probably, but how can we do that?”
“No time now. Let’s just say we can.”
***
Raefe asked the guard if he could get some water. He gave Lina a look and she nodded back. After he went up to water station, she made her own excuses and found him.
“Look at me,” he said. “Don’t talk. Hold my hands and look right in my eyes.”
Hearing the urgency in his voice, she did.
He could feel her mind. Not clear like Diver’s, but there. She startled, but kept her hands with his. He saw a little smile on her face and felt a warmth. He thought “I love you”” and closed his eyes.
They both collapsed, lying lifeless on the beach. The guards rushed over. The workers watched as two guards tried to revive them. One of them had a med puter.
“Their hearts are beating, they’re breathing!”
“Good. Send the feed to HQ. I’ll call and see if they want to evac them,” their sergeant said.
“They may not want to,” the guard said. “I’m getting no higher function brain waves at all. Seems like they’re on internal life support. Some fucking new drug the fugees are into?”
“Hey, Sarge,” another guard spoke up. “I don’t think we’re going to evac them. Turn around.”
The guards and the workers turned back toward the water. Far on the horizon, a strange gray curtain pulled up out of the ocean. The curtain was moving quickly toward them and revealed itself as an avalanche of water falling down an endless 50 meter high wall of water.
The sergeant threw down his rifle at the feet of the two bodies.
“Lucky bastards, to escape before that.”

            <Text>Flying solo
Traveller’s Perch
October 1, 2048
Diver was doubly excited  this morning. She had made up her mind about Raefe. And she was going to fly.  
Most people on Traveller’s Perch cherished their distant past as partially airborne creatures, but she was one of the few who had learned to use their enhancements, plus a flight suit, to actually ride the air currents high above the canyons as their more avian ancestors had done naturally. That was, in fact, how she had met Flies Far to Cross Oceans — they both belonged to the same avian flying club.
 People who didn’t hadn’t experienced the unenhanced lives of other species thought her foolish or eccentric. But  ambassadors often cherished the rawness of such experiences, the sheer physicality of them. She had discovered something else too: her mind worked differently when flying. Most people on Traveller’s Perch, when faced with a difficult problem, gave their enhancements multiple assignments to go off and dig through masses of data and come back with suggestions. That was great if the answer to your problem lay buried in mountains of data.
But sometimes she wanted a sharper strategic view, a way to get past difficulty and reach whatever prize she was interested in. She found her own organic mind worked in that fashion best when she flew. While her enhancements could help her, when she flew, somewhere deep in her mind she was engaging circuits that were constantly evaluating threats and opportunities. She had found that the combination of flying and deep thinking could be powerful. Today she would put that to the test.
She felt her body generating her morning nutrients and suppressed them — she had other plans for food today. She ordered her rooms to open the front wall and reshape it into a balcony. She looked out over the canyons hundreds of meters below, still flooded to remind everyone of  their last brush with environmental suicide 10,000 years ago. A breeze brought the first hint of warmth from Prime’s dawn to her face, and decorated the water with a dance of foam, pink in the sun’s rising red light. Higher in the sky, Prime’s trinary mates, the Twins, still shone like orange eyes against the black of space. Prime’s other two planets,  Red Nest and Water Eye, were on the other side of Traveller’s Perch this morning. Soon they would all perform their complex dance across the day, the changing light powering the thermal cycle that all life on the planet lived by. 
She smiled, thinking of the stories the ancients had about their sky. Prime was Mother, and the Twins were First Father and Second Father. The planets were their children. They thought the Fathers were doing a mating dance with Mother, and that the children were approaching her for food. Adno’s people, on Water Eye, had a completely different story, one that mostly made sense if you spent all your time in the water on an almost landless planet. When their species had finally discovered each other thousands of years ago, their exchanges of myth and superstition had helped each species to understand the limits of their own perceptions in deep ways that had helped them avoid war.
Diver checked her flight suit, making sure its wings would release properly, transforming her body into something close to what it would have been in ancient times. Standing on the edge of the balcony, she let her enhancements feel the winds. She dove, arms tight at her side, and kicked to release the small webs tucked between her three large toes, forming a tail where each foot had been. She used these small tails to guide her descent. She felt the sun on her back, the wind hard on her face as she angled toward the water at over 60 kilometers an hour. At 30 meters above the water, she flung her arms wide, releasing her wings, breaking and angling nearly vertical to the water. The pressure was enormous, but nothing her enhancements couldn’t handle.
She hit the water with arms tight to her sides and feet together, plowing into the back of a school of silvery fish. Her mouth closed around a good sized one even as her legs were just breaking the surface. She arched her back out of the water, extended her feet, and thrust her arms out into the air in a swimming motion. Two more thrusts, and she caught the bottom of the air currents and tacked upwards toward her balcony.
Sitting on her haunches, the sun full up now, she ate the fish methodically. She chewed slowly, savoring the texture and flavor of wild food much as she imagined her ancestors had done millenia before. Maybe she would let Far Flier relive it with her later. Or did he still catch his own fish once and awhile?
Her body alive, her mind aware, she instructed the room to fetch transportation. She was ready for Raefe now. Her little hunting trip and musings about how her people and Adno’s had faced each other for the first time had brought home to her that she must find a way into Raefe’ mind in a way that would be familiar to him, even if not totally accurate. There would be time for that later, she hoped.
A few minutes later, the room opened a portal in its back wall and she stepped into a small subway car, half full with neighbors also headed toward work. The train emerged from the tunnel behind their dwelling onto the broad flats of the plateau overlooking the canyons.
With the three stars in a low radiation configuration today, most of the buildings had emerged from below and had uncovered the transparent domes that topped them. Adapting to the complex solar cycles had plagued life on Traveller’s Perch forever, but now their enhancements worked with the city’s brain to modulate the light and dark periods, allowing everyone to even out their metabolism, sleep and activity. 
Today’s light was bright without being harsh, and tilted toward the warm. The buildings had adopted an appropriate palette, and the overall affect was quite cheery. Some of her colleagues thought she romanticized the primitive, but she was just as pleased by the city’s display as by her morning fishing expedition. That was one of the things that had drawn her to Far Flier. He might be quite a bit older than her, and a bit full of himself, but Far Flier got her appetite for the deep fundamental experiences at the core of life. Having been an ambassador himself, he had felt first hand the intensity with which unenhanced species had to pursue food to survive. He understood that evolution had planted a love of those skills deep inside every advanced life form.
And today, she would help Raefe surface some of those skills. For the first time, she would guide a less evolved species through the first baby steps of becoming adept at controlled entanglement. She had studied and trained for a century for this very moment. She wanted to burst into song. She told herself to remain calm and focused. She would need to be alert with Raefe to make sure his first experience was positive. She might not get a second chance.
 At the Guardian Center, she found her way to her usual spot on the inner ring of the wormhole interface. Far Flier and Tanoch mocked her belief that she could better connect here, but she couldn’t deny her own senses. She might be awhile here, though, so she asked the bench to reshape itself into more of a couch, molded more to her body than a bench. No one was around, so she re-colored the room walls and lighting and adjusted the sound and temperature. She told herself to stop fussing and delaying and get to work.
Surprisingly, Raefe’s mind was easy to find today. The fear and stress that she was worried about had triggered changes in him. Intrigued, she probed his memories. At first his strong empathic abilities had overwhelmed him but since she last entangled with him,  his mind had responded by reaching out more strongly to those around him. And she saw that the crisis had intensified his connections with Lina. He was still confused, unstable, a raging storm of desire to do something that would make a difference, and a lack of confidence that he could. Part of him could not bear so much sadness and loss around him, part of him could not bear not being able to do anything to alleviate it. She could feel this conflict more deeply than she had been able to probe his mind before — he was more fully entangled — and he felt to her like a ripe altipano fruit ready to burst. 
She knew that she should discuss this with the Guardian Council when they met in two days, or at least Far Flier,  but she felt that Raefe’s life hung in the balance. He was the most promising of the two or three thousand humans they monitored.  Losing him would set them back years, maybe generations. Did Earth have that much time? 
She should consult with Green — he was in charge of Timelines. He could help her sort through the multiverses to find an Earth that had a Raefe but was not this close to catastrophe. They could transmit Raefe’s consciousness to the Raefe in that timeline — he would bring the knowledge of a harsher fate to the other Raefe, and still hopefully be driven by his near-death experience,  use his empathic powers to change history. She would do that, but for now, she needed to make contact. Time for her to act. She had learned an old Earth saying from Raefe — rules are made to be broken.
It was already night on Earth so she could reach out to him, make first contact in his dreams. With humans, that had so far proven the safest way. 
Raefe and Lina had snuck out of the camp. Diver realized they were going off to couple. Humans were usually calmer after sex. Good thing they’re not like the Glynx, who only mated once in a lifetime, after which their whole tribe celebrated for days. She dampened her entanglement with Raefe so as not to risk distracting him. An hour later, she was glad to see that they both had drifted off to sleep in a good state of mind.
She had learned to infiltrate many human’s dreams and Raefe’s were no different. In his memories, she found images of friendly females that sometimes appeared in his dreams. One was a character in a vid he liked to watch, a 2 meter tall woman, longer and leaner than most real humans, with very long straight yellow hair. She had a variety of enhancements that made her what humans referred to as “super.” Diver found the hair odd and so modified the image to match her own purple and green shades. In his dream, Raefe was was sitting at his workplace. She walked up to him.
&quot;Mars Girl?&quot; he asked.”Is that you? What have you done to your hair?”
&quot;I'm Diver From Great Heights, but my friends just call me Diver. I come from space, just like Mars Girl. You’re Raefe, right?&quot;
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot;
&quot;Let’s just say that you have a special gift that interests me. You are just beginning to come to grips with it, but your world desperately needs people who have this gift.”
“My world? What world are you from?”
 “I live on Traveller’s Perch, about 20 light years from you. My world was like your world about 10,000 years ago. Now we try to help worlds like yours survive and move forward.&quot;
&quot;I don’t understand. You've traveled here to see me?&quot;
&quot;Traveling with my body would take many lifetimes — even I can’t travel faster than light. But we can send energy — information — through wormholes that make communication seem instantaneous.&quot;
&quot;So, you're just some kind of holo vid?&quot;
&quot;Not exactly. More like we each live on one end of a giant guitar string made of light. Whichever one of us plucks it, we both feel it. So right now, my brain and your brain are playing a song — having a conversation — over these many light years. We can do that because we are entangled, at a quantum level, with each other.&quot;
&quot;Quantum level? How does that work? Did someone plant a chip in me?&quot;
She sensed his fear. She had unintentionally triggered images of possession — their culture was still so steeped in ancient superstition. She made herself smaller, changed the surroundings to his childhood home. They were sitting on a couch, school children. Her face now reminded him of a childhood friend, Samantha.
“Raefe, you don’t need a chip,” she smiled. &quot;Sometimes you feel like an antenna, right?”
“And I can’t turn it off.”
“That’s because you are extremely empathetic — much more than most humans. You feel other people’s feelings very strongly.”
“Yes!” he said. “It’s too much sometimes. How do I do that?””
“Many ways that you don’t realize. You smell the hormones that leak from all people, you have finely tuned mirror neurons that very accurately interpret people’s gestures and movements, but most of all, deep inside, unknown to you, you are entangled with the electromagnetic storm that is their emotions.”
“Are those the voices I hear but not quite make out?”
“Yes, in a way. Your brain tells you that they are speaking but can’t make out the words, but that’s because you are hearing the play of raw emotions, which don’t live as words in your heads. But you know the feeling behind them — happy, sad, angry, and so on. Do you feel like they are laughing or crying or yelling, but you don’t know why?”
“Exactly! It’s like feeling crazy and half deaf at the same time. Very unnerving. I’m almost relieved to hear what you say. My head has been so filled with moaning and anguish from all sides, I was beginning to think I had a connection to Hell.”
“Relax, there is no Hell. You are perfectly sane and your abilities are growing. Your mind wants to reach out, to feel others and to let them feel you and other people, too. While it is not something encouraged right now in your world, it is something humans will have to get better at if they are to progress. If your world is to survive, connection and empathy must become more important than competition and aggression.”
“So are you saying that we can sort of talk to each other, but without speaking?”
“Not exactly. At this point, humans can learn to have a much deeper sense of each other’s emotions. You can use words for ideas and concepts, but words are not always the best way to convince each other of your motivations and intentions. Suppose I say ‘I mean you no harm.’ How do you know I mean it?”
“Right, you could be lying or telling the truth and say the same thing.”
“If you could feel my emotions, feel whether I was friendly, agreeable, resigned, angry, sneering at you, then you would know how to interpret my words.”
She was tempted to explain to him that later they could augment this with technology that would, in fact, allow people to converse one on one without speaking, and even later, for entire groups to do that. But the Guardians had learned not to give new species a tour of the future: it was a country best visited in person.
“But you should know,” she continued, “that there are others like you, and you all can help lead humans away from self destruction.”
“Lead humans? You’ve got the wrong guy. I can barely get through the day anymore. I can’t help anyone. I don’t want that job.”
She subtley shifted the environment so that they were walking through meadow dotted with wildflowers. It was sunny and a pleasant breeze entertained them. She wanted him to be calm but also hopeful.
“Your empathic powers helped you, Lina, Kiko and Kayam to survive the flood. Don’t forget that — you’ve already done something huge. Tell me, how do you feel since then?”
“I can’t stop hearing the screams of the people that didn’t make it,” he said.
“And the headaches?” she asked.
“I have to admit, they’ve become weaker and less frequent.”
“That’s because you’re beginning to master your own abilities. And because you were able to use them to save someone you love. So they’re not just a handicap anymore. What other changes have you noticed?”
“Well, I have to admit, other people seem a little less of a mystery to me. Now that you mention it, I do have more of a sense of what they really mean,” he said, mulling it over. “So what are you doing here?”
“Think of me as a midwife. Imagine you’re giving birth to yourself. The new you will be someone you are very proud to be. But first, you must go through the process of birth. Are you ready for that?”
“Slow down! Give birth, new me — I feel like I just started being me. Not sure I want to get rid of me yet.”
She could feel his mind frantically reviewing vids of alien possession, demons. 
“Sorry, sometimes I forget how strange it must seem if you’ve never entangled with another person. I can give you a sense of it first, so you see it’s nothing to fear.” She found every point of entanglement she could. “Can you feel that?”
“Yeah, I do. It’s like I’m seeing you in three dimensions. More like four or five, like I’m seeing the outside of you, but also your feelings and thoughts, all at the same time.”
“That’s it. It will be a long time before you can do this on your own. At first, you will just be able to sense people’s emotions. In time, you will see some of the thoughts that accompany those emotions. I have technology that augments my capabilities and can hear the thoughts of those I entangle with almost as you do on the device you call a Voice. For now, though, every little touch you feel in your mind, touch back.”
“I can’t really touch you. It’s like I’m a school of fish and you are too, and we’re passing through each other.”
“Now imagine more and more fish in each school until there’s only a small amount of water between your fish and my fish. I’m silver fish and you’re gold fish. Can you see that?”
“Yes!”
“One more step. Feel how we each disturb the water between us. Move and feel how the water moves. Now I’ll move. Can you feel the vibrations in the water as I move?”
“The vibrations — that’s was how you speak to me?”
“Brilliant! Now you’ve got it. When you feel your headaches, when you feel like the people around you are shouting their thoughts at you in a giant jumble, you’re feeling that water, just all mixed up. If you can focus, you can feel how each little eddy and whorl comes from a mind, how they form a giant chord, and you will learn to separate their melodies.”
“I believe that. Sometimes I sense something like that.”
“It’s no worse than being in noisy place and hearing a lot of voices. It’s just that these voices go deeper into your mind, into your feelings and sometimes, what you think of as your soul. Someday, all humans will be able to do this. But your mind can do this now.”
Diver wanted his last memories of her to be peaceful. She shifted the scene to a subway car. He and Lina were sitting in the seat next to her. Lina was asleep on his shoulder. 
“Soon you will awake and you will remember this. Have a good day!”
She slowly withdrew from his mind, letting his subconscious finish the dream.

            <Text>Island life
October 14, 2048
Raefe and Lina were jammed into a big helicopter with 54 other fugees. A half dozen Brightstar mercs kept an eye on them, hands never far from their weapons. For the mercs, fugees were always a threat, even if they came from your own neighborhood. The chopper roared off the launch pad, the noise of the rotors and the wind a thick fluid filling the cabin.
Raefe could smell the sea now, as the wind whipped through the open chopper door. They passed over Logan Airport, its runways lying drowned, feet to the terminals, heads under water. Deer Island was once again an actual island, the causeway leading to it submerged and little but the globes of the waste water plant visible above the surf. To the right, the thick stone walls of an old colonial fort stuck 5 meters out of the water like an aquatic Stonehenge, their foundations invisible beneath the choppy water. To the left and right, the familiar coastline of the harbor was blurred and smudged by the new tide line and tons of sandy mud.  Near the sea, roads  came and went, sea walls had become islands, half-drowned buildings tilted in the surf.
Coming from the Somerville hills, down across the shore, out over the drowned islands, Raefe felt like some character in an ancient myth. A character descending into a watery underworld, filled by souls the planet had washed from the land.
He watched Lina’s brown curls swirl in the wind, exposing the ugly, ropey scar on her right ear she never talked about. What was going through her mind, to have survived the Efricar holocaust, escaped to Sofricar, migrated here, and now, once again a fugee and for all practical purposes, a prisoner? He could feel her anger and her sadness, but something else he couldn’t quite name. Something dark and deep. Was it the same feeling that was enveloping him, that they were refugees now, not from some human conflict, but from nature itself?
They swept out over the open water and soon Truro Island was in sight. Five years had come and gone since the same rising waters that had inundated Ireland had severed the outer arm of Cape Cod just above Wellfleet Harbor. Wind and water had blunted the knife lines of that amputation, smoothing and curving them into an ordinary, if steep, island shoreline.
They landed on field of hard packed dirt on a bluff 25 meters above the ocean. Their first words of welcome to the island were an incessant, robotic, “Single file, single file” from the mercs grabbing their arms and pulling them off the helicopter. A soldier gave them a more informative introduction through a bullhorn.
“East Somerville Work Detail welcome to Sea Wall Construction Camp Alpha. You will be reporting here at this exact spot every  morning, Monday through Saturday. Sunday is yours. Sergeant Merto will be your work detail leader. Sergeant!”
“Yes sir! Listen up. You are on Truro Island, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. See those seals on the sandbar? They’re sitting there so they don’t get eaten by great white sharks. It’s October and prolonged immersion in the water is cold enough to kill you, even if the sharks don’t. The mainland is 30 miles from the other side of the island. You will all be chipped in the arm. If you get lost, we can find you. If you run away, we will find you.
“You’re all here because a hurricane broke the Atlantic Sea Wall and made you homeless. Being homeless, you consumed a lot of government aid, supplies that the government bought from us but can’t pay for. So now you can work off your relief aid by rebuilding the wall. Specifically, the part of that sea wall extended from Truro Island north to Cape Ann. We will load up barges with supplies and go out to the work sites. Some days we will return, some days we will stay out on mobile work camps on the water.  The work will be hard, but you’ll get three squares and a roof over your head at night. We’re all here to do a job, but we won’t tolerate any funny business in the camp. No gambling, no pimping, stealing, drugs — you get the picture.”
“Lastly, some of you fancy yourself some kind of fugee legal expert and you’re going to ask me about your rights. Forget it. For all practical purposes, you are no longer in the United States or the state of Massachusetts. You are an employee of Digi Brands. And Digi has subcontract to Brightstar to take any and all means necessary to get this wall built. Short of executing you, we have total authority while you are here. This project is forecast to take 11 months. After that, your life is yours to fuck up how you want. Meanwhile, don’t screw this up.”
 Lina whispered to him, “Welcome to my world.”
 They got injected in the arm with a tiny telemetry capsule and then were issued yellow overalls with names and numbers written in red marker. He was now Epstein Miller, 4456, she was now Kawambai Yang, 5198. The whole crew spent the afternoon putting up large tents where they would sleep. Just like Somerville, sleeping quarters were divided three ways into families, males, and females, with a fourth tent for eating.
Night brought a quiet to the camp. Back in Somerville, some of the people had played cards at night. Sometimes small groups gathered around the few people who had rescued a guitar and sang songs. This night, no one was in the mood for socializing. After a desultory meal of curried lentils, with a token bit of chicken, Raefe and Lina wandered aways from the tents. A big oak had somehow survived all the hurricanes, and they sat down against it, the camp to their backs. He had never seen so many stars.
“Do you think they’re laughing at us up there?” he wondered. He put his arm around Lina but felt her stiffen. He knew that sometimes Lina didn’t want comfort, so he let it go.
“Only if their world isn’t as fucked as this one.”
“There’s a thought — what would they say to us if we could talk to them? From a world that made more sense this.”
“That made any sense,” Lina said. “How does it make sense that two kids like us, just trying to put one foot in front of the other, almost drown in a catastrophic flood, and now are risking death working against our will on a construction project in the middle of the ocean?”
She stood up, fidgety, pacing. He felt an unsettlement of her spirit, as if it had forgotten how it fit inside her.
“I don’t know,” Raefe answered. “Can I ask you, was this what is was like when you were a kid in Efricar?”
&quot;No kids in Efricar,&quot; Lina said, looking away from him, staring out across a barren field. &quot;Just little people trying to live long enough to get big. Living like this was not the worst that could happen to you.”
Raefe could hear seals barking and squealing 50 meters offshore as they pushed and shoved for the best sleeping spots, the scent of nearby humans making them a bit agitated. Twenty years ago, we left their world. Wonder if they’re happy to see us back, he thought. I think you’ll get your island back soon enough.
“You’re putting on your armor for the long haul, aren’t you? You’re getting ready for another couple of years of this,” he said.
“Maybe,” she said. “I don’t know.”
“No, it’s OK. I can feel it.”
Lina looked at him sharply. “You don’t know what’s in my mind.”
“That’s the thing,” he said. “I realize I do know some of it, a lot of the time. And not just you. The night of the flood, why I woke up? I felt the screams and the terror of the people at the water’s edge, the first people to drown. I thought it was a dream, but it was the real thing.”
“How do you know?”
He wanted to tell her about Diver, but it didn’t feel like the right time.
“Let’s just say that since that night, I’ve been paying more attention. The headaches and all that — I realize I was just overwhelmed by other people’s feelings sometimes. I’m just one of those people that’s very tuned in, subconsciously, to other people. I can smell anger, or lust. Strong emotions like that, I can feel them in other people.”
She eyed him silently for a few seconds. “And you think you feel what I’m thinking?”
“Not so much in words as images and feelings. Alright, tell me I’m wrong. When we were on the dinner line, you saw those lentils and you thought about eating those with your mother in Efricar. It was a nice memory, like you were a girl sitting with your mom under a tree, eating. But then it hit you hard, right, here I am, like a girl in Efricar, in a camp with soldiers. And you instinctively wiped any expression of your face so the guards couldn’t decipher you, because that’s what you learned in that camp. That’s what I meant about armor.”
Lina looked away.
“You’re freaking me out,” she said. “I don’t know if I realized that myself, but you hit it pretty much on the head, now that I think about it. All this time we’ve been together, you’ve been doing this?”
“No, not at all. I started to realize something was going on after the flood,” he said. Make something up, it’s not time to tell her about Mars Girl. “I found stuff on the net, here and there. People like me are called empaths. Everyone is a bit of an empath. I’m just more so. And because we’re already close, I get more of you than I do of strangers. Anyway, I just wanted to say that you don’t have to put up your armor with me.”
“Seems like it won’t work anyway. But I’m worried about you — armor is a good thing when you’re surrounded by hatred. You don’t want to be smelling that too much.”
“Right, need some anti-hatred deodorant,” he laughed. “But you know what? I think we’re going to be OK. These guards — they’re pretty relaxed. Just doing a job. I don’t think they’re waiting to gun us down soon as we’ve finished the wall.”
“How about the sharks? What are you smelling from them?”
***
 In the morning, they piled on to flat bed trucks that took them to the beach. They drove along empty, broken asphalt roads, a black ribbon through the grey forests, leaves long dead from years of salt-laden hurricanes. Here and there, the dead wood was streaked black from lightning fires. Around a corner, the sun shone bright off something green. They drove closer — it was algae growing in the salt ponds, safe from the ocean waves. 
The beach was a different story. There were trucks, piles of materials, many trucks unloading prisoners and supplies. Zodiacs came and went. They sat huddled in one, then get off on a sandbar. The seals barked at one end while they stood knee deep at the other, building a pylon out of recycled plastic blocks. The morning sun warmed the shallows but by afternoon the clouds had rolled in and they could no longer feel their feet. The guards let them rotate in and out of the water, giving them a few minutes to get the feeling back in their feet.
Raefe found himself sitting on mound of building supplies next to the man who had interrupted Robertson back in Somerville. He tipped his head to Raefe and grunted “Hey.”
“Alton Winchester,” the man said. “And I’m guessing you’re Raefe?”
“How do you know my name?”
“I saw with you with Lina. Used to see her down at the K&amp;K. She talks about you a lot.”
“I dug what you did the other day.”
One of the guards came over and glared at them.
“Alright ladies, I’m sure your little footsies are warm enough now. Back to work.”
As they trudged back into the water, Alton looked back for an instant, mouthing “Look me up tonight.”
That night, in the mess tent, they found Alton and sat down next to him.
“So here we are,” Alton said to Lina. “Two fugees trying to survive the apocalypse again. And not even Kayam’s Cubanos to make it almost worthwhile.”
“Yeah, he and Kiko didn’t get scooped up for this gig, somehow. But you, you haven’t missed a beat with that Goodstuff Benjamin track,” Lina said.
“Who’s that?” Raefe asked.
“Me and Alton always ago round about him,” Lina said. “He’s a Nigerian guy Alton’s into.”
“He’s not just a guy,” Alton said. “He’s a teacher, a leader. He’s the head of the New Voodo Army. They’re into mass resistance to the corpos, the mercs, the religious extremists.”
“So pretty much every authority figure in the world,” Raefe laughed. “Who’s left to run things?”
“They are,” Alton said. “That’s the point. The NVA is all about self-determination.”
“Alton, before you give us that speech,” Lina said, “I have to ask you. Did we just go from being fugees in Somerville to prisoners on an island?”
“You’re not wrong,” Alton said. “Technically, we can leave. But we give up any claim to any benefits or support. Total free agents.”
“Son of a bitch,” Lina swore. “Where would we go?”
“Wherever we go, we are always in the diaspora. Nothing has changed.”
“When I came here five years ago, I thought I was leaving all that behind.”
“Same for me. I came here in ‘39 from Jamaica, after the plague. I was one of the 5%, the immune ones.”
“What’s going on?” Raefe asked. “What just happened?””
“They only tell us half the story,” Winchester said. “I’ve been in touch on the Net with different folks.  That storm was the worst since the ‘43 floods. But the impact was the biggest ever because it hit so many people and it was in the belly of the beast. The New York financial center. The Boston bioinformatics complex. The  US economy brought to its knees. Beaches littered with dead fish. Fresh water reservoirs turned into salt ponds.”
“Where does this all fit in?” Raefe said, waving around the chopper.
“Looks like Digi swooped in, forced the Feds to give them a lot of East Coast territory. It’s a disaster zone now, but they get to run their own economic zones near all the big metro hubs. They pay no taxes, they can squeeze their competitors, and call the shots about what gets rebuilt and what doesn’t. First thing they want to do is protect their investment, get this sea wall up.”
Later that night, Raefe lay awake on his cot, still but unable to sleep. For much of his life, he had felt overwhelmed by the constant flux of people and their feelings. This place reminded him of a long car ride he had taken as a little boy, somewhere out in the midwest where it was empty between the cities. Cars were still common then, and there was still radio, before they all got Voices and eyeball puters and everything was there on the Net. His mom sat in the front seat, trying to find music on the radio dial. But there was nothing but static, the empty sound of the universe, to accompany her frustration and anger.
It came to him how much of his childhood had involved loss. Somehow, he’d come to feel responsible, like if he hadn’t been in that car, his mother would have found a radio station and it would be playing that crazy Arab trance music she loved. Of course, how could he have understood that they were driving through the badlands that years of drought had painted on what his mom had once known as corn and wheat, as far as the eye could see? Even now, knowing it, he couldn’t shake the feeling that a different child, a better person, would have made it better for his mom.
Now, his mind was a radio, and he could hear faint signals from all the stations in all the minds around him. Much of it was fatigue and despair. But there were notes of affection for friends, happiness over small things, and always, the desire to hope. I have a gift, he thought, that I don’t know what to do with. Where was Mars Girl when you needed her?

            <Text>Meet the new boss
October 2, 2048
Lina woke him before dawn so they could sneak back into the camp. He wanted to tell her something but couldn’t remember what. The 6 AM horn sounded and he filed into the shower room. As the water hit him, he remembered bits of the dream he’d had the night before. Mars Girl had been on the subway, only she had green and purple hair. There were fish floating through the air, but no water. He couldn’t quite piece it together.
He ate breakfast like it was cough syrup.
“Hey, I thought you’d be hungry this morning,” Lina said, giving him a little elbow. “You’re making me feel like I messed up somehow last night.”
“Not to worry,” he said. “I guess I didn’t sleep much — crazy dreams. I’m sure by tonight, I’ll be hungry again.” He nudged her back.
“Glad to hear it. Weird to have to sneak around though, hah? Our Tiny might have just been one big room, but we could take care of all our earthly needs just fine.”
“If only it had been waterproof and had a boat engine.”
After breakfast, they shaped up with their crew and made the usual march down to the work site. Another morning moving scattered bricks and twisted steel. But the streets were starting to look almost normal. 
Maybe the worst of it was over, Raefe thought. Lina is right, I can’t drown in this. 
He let himself feel the arms and legs of the dozen of them, pushing, lifting, shaping, building. It was an infectious rhythm, an old-timey Second Line street parade of sweat and exertion, and he gave himself over to it.  Soon he was lost in all their thoughts, feeling the silver fish of their thoughts pass through his gold…
Holy shit. This is what I dreamed. Purple and green lady was not Mars Girl, she was Diver, an alien. Did that actually happen?
Maybe it had been a dream, but the feeling wouldn’t go away. He couldn’t actually read anyone’s thoughts, like what did Mo, the big Haitian guy, think about Sonja as he was chatting her up, but he felt that Mo was not paying attention to his shovel, and thinking he was somewhere else, a food stand maybe? Lina had a bit of a hum about her. Everyone was enjoying the sun as it warmed up this fallish October morning. Wasn’t that what Diver had said, that he’d feel connected?
No voices were talking to him from the clouds. He wasn’t getting instructions to kill everyone with blue eyes or shorter than a meter and a half. And he wasn’t getting a headache. Real or not, maybe something had happened to him during the night. Something good, for a change.
“Hey, dreamy,” Nhitin, their crew boss, barked. “Sleep at night, work during the day. You’re starting to get the hang of it — show me you can totally do it.”
“The staff’s all wound up,” Sammy, one of the guys on their crew, whispered to him. “Something’s going down.”
All morning, people traded rumors — they were all being shipped out somewhere, the government was going to build new TinyStacks for everyone, they were all getting $10,000 to start anew. Anyone who had salvaged their Voice or taken their puter when fleeing the water was sneaking off to search for answers. But no one found anything solid. There were dozens of camps like this, the government itself was even less functional than usual, and the Net was full of even more sooty information than usual. Morning went and at noon they had lunch break. A Brightstar Defense Services truck showed up with food. Raefe and Lina grabbed some rice and beans and found a good rubble pile to sit on.
“Hey, Nhitin thinks you’re dreamy,” Lina teased him.
“Any dream with Nhitin in it counts as a nightmare to me,” Raefe shot back.
“But you had those dreams again last night, didn’t you?” she asked. “It worries me.”
“I had a dream, kind of strange, but no, it wasn’t what you think. I’m fine.” He just didn’t feel ready to tell her more yet.
“Well, good. Wouldn’t be good if you freak out every time we get busy.”
“Authentic. I think more tests are called for, Dr. Feelgood.” 
“I think they should test this food,” Lina grimaced. “Tastes like it was made before the flood.”
Something loud was coming from back over Winter Hill. The lunch chatter stopped as everyone looked up. Three large helicopters crested the hill, approaching rapidly, noise and dust growing.
“More Brightstar,” Lina shouted over the noise.
“Yeah, I see,” Raefe said. “Same blue camo as the truck.”
 As fast as they had appeared, they landed down the block, on a now empty used electric car lot. Some government soldiers got out, followed by some suits and a woman in a Brightstar officer’s uniform. The soldiers escorted the suits and the Brightstar brass toward the worksite.
“Geez,” he whispered to Lina, “They look like they’re on a mission behind the lines.”
“I’m Captain Erzel, Second Engineers, Brightstar Logistics,” the woman said through a bullhorn. “We want to tell you what’s next in the relief effort.  We’ve been asked by the government to coordinate now that we’re past the initial crisis. With me is Ken Robertson, the CEO of Digi Brands. He’s going to explain what’s next.”
“Thanks, Captain Erzel,” Robertson said, taking the bullhorn. “You’re probably wondering why this surprise visit in the middle of the day. The simple reason is that we’re all in a hurry, you and me and 100 million people on the East Coast whose lives were torn up by Hurricane Fatima almost a month ago. Roads are still spotty, the Net goes in and out, and people want to get home and back to school and work. Take a look around.”
Robertson swept his arm across the scenery.
“You’ve worked hard. There are 13 other relief camps along the Massachusetts Bay, and they have all done the same. You’ve paved the way, so to speak, for the next phase. Rebuilding. And so we need to bring in real builders. When it comes to putting up bridges, roadways, and offices fast and efficiently, Brightstar Logistics is second to none. So they are going to take over that phase of it. But we have some priorities that need your contribution, urgently, and we’re going to be moving you, and many of the other relief camps to those places and projects.”
“Excuse me,” a middle-aged man stood up. “Moving us? What happened to rebuilding our homes, our neighborhoods? And why are you, Digi Brands, talking to us? Where’s the mayor? The governor?”
Robertson looked uncomfortable. An aide whispered in his ear. Raefe had a sudden woosh of feeling from the two of them; a little panic, a little bit of something that reminded him of an old verb — tap dancing. Must be like that Limerick Leap dance that had been all the rage a few years ago — people jumping up and down willy nilly like they were walking barefoot on hot coals.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “My associate was just explaining to me that you may not be aware of the latest news. Things have been moving fast. So let me backtrack a little. Some of you still have your puters and you may be aware that the crisis has stretched the government, at all levels, to a breaking point. Put simply, the government is broke, bankrupt. President Schwartz and I have been discussing the situation for the last two weeks and we have come to an agreement. The US government has granted Digi Brands a semi-autonomous zone that corresponds to the entire Massachusetts Bay flood area. We are assuming responsibility for rebuilding, because we see tremendous opportunity here, and we have the resources to stay in it for the duration.”
“So what are you saying?” the man who had interrupted asked. “We work for you?”
“Precisely,” Robertson smiled. “And we have important work to do. We, along with Brightstar, have prioritized rebuilding the Atlantic Sea Wall as a top priority. We expect two or three more hurricanes between now and February that are Category 5 or worse. You’ll be working with the Brightstar team on Truro Island. These helicopters will take you there — don’t worry, your personal belongings from the camp are being packed up right now and will be on board shortly.”
“Finish your food,” Captain Erzel said. “In 20 minutes, we’ll load up the choppers and head out.”
Why did Raefe feel like there was an unspoken “poor bastards” at the end of that?</Text>

November 9, 2048
 In the morning, they piled on to flat bed trucks that took them to the beach. They drove along empty, broken asphalt roads, a black ribbon through the grey forests, leaves long killed by years of salt-laden hurricanes. Here and there, the dead wood was streaked black from lightning fires. Around a corner, the sun shone bright off something green. They drove closer —— it was algae growing in the salt ponds, safe from the ocean waves. 
The beach was a different story. There were trucks, piles of materials, many trucks unloading prisoners and supplies. Zodiacs came and went. They sat huddled in one, then get off on a sandbar. The seals barked at one end while they stood knee deep at the other, building a pylon out of recycled plastic blocks. The morning sun warmed the shallows but by afternoon the clouds had rolled in and they could no longer feel their feet. The guards let them rotate in and out of the water, giving them a few minutes to get the feeling back in their feet.
Raefe found himself sitting on mound of building supplies next to the man who had interrupted Robertson back in Somerville. He tipped his head to Raefe and grunted a “Hey.”
“Alton Winchester,” the man said. “And I’m guessing you’’re Raefe?”
“How do you know my name?”
“I saw with you with Lina. Used to see her down at the K&amp;K. She talks about you a lot.”
“I dug what you did the other day.”
One of the guards came over and glared at them.
“Alright ladies, I’m sure your little footsies are warm enough now. Back to work.”
As they trudged back into the water, Alton looked back for an instant, mouthing “Look me up tonight.”
That night, in the mess tent, they found Alton and sat down next to him.
“So here we are,” Alton said to Lina. “Two fugees trying to survive the apocalypse again. And not even Kayam’s Cubanos to make it almost worthwhile.”
“You don’t miss a beat with that Goodstuff Benjamin track,” Lina said.
“Who’s that?” Raefe asked.
“Me and Alton always ago round about him,” Lina said. “He’s a Nigerian guy Alton’s into.”
“He’s not just a guy,” Alton said. “He’’s a teacher, a leader. He’s the head of the New Voodo Army. They’re into mass resistance to the corpos, the mercs, the religious extremists.”
“So pretty much every authority figure in the world,” Raefe laughed. “Who’s left to run things?”
“They are,” Alton said. “That’s the point. The NVA is all about self-determination.””
“Alton, before you give us that speech,” Lina said, “I have to ask you. Did we just go from being fugees in Somerville to prisoners on an island?””
“You’re not wrong,” Alton said. “Technically, we can leave. But we give up any claim to any benefits or support. Total free agents.”
“Son of a bitch,” Lina swore. “Where would we go?”
“Wherever we go, we are always in the diaspora. Nothing has changed.”
“When I came here five years ago, I thought I was leaving all that behind.”
“Same for me. I came here in ‘39 from Jamaica, after the plague. I was one of the 5%, the immune ones.”
“What’s going on,” Raefe asked. “What just happened to us anyway?””
“They only tell us half the story,” Winchester said. “I’ve been in touch on the Net with different folks.  That storm was the worst since the ‘41 floods. But the impact was the biggest ever because it hit so many people and it was in the belly of the beast. The New York financial center. The Boston bioinformatics complex. The  US economy brought to its knees. Beaches littered with dead fish. Fresh water reservoirs turned into salt ponds.””
“Where does this all fit in?” Raefe said, waving around the chopper.
“Looks like Digi swooped in, forced the Feds to give them a lot of East Coast territory. It’s a disaster zone now, but they get to run their own economic zones near all the big metro hubs. They pay no taxes, they can squeeze their competitors, and call the shots about what gets rebuilt and what doesn’t. First thing they want to do is protect their investment, get this sea wall up.”
Later that night, Raefe lay awake on his cot, still but unable to sleep. For much of his life, he had felt overwhelmed by the constant flux of people and their feelings.

            <Text>Preface
A billion years ago
A group of fighters stand on a battlefield, bone weary, dirty, hunger their only nourishment. The smoke of battle only lets a few stars shine in the night sky. But the dim air is quiet, the roar of battle over for now, as the remaining armies of all three Houses rest in the carnage that has consumed their world for 30 years.
 In a clearing, one of the fighters stands on hood of a personnel carrier. Naw’ra, a low-ranking officer in the army of the Second House, addresses a a few dozen officers from all three armies.
“Brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, we have fought this great battle for many years. One in three of us who was alive when it started has now fallen. Our air is thick with smoke, our water with blood, and our land covered with our dead, and the dead of all else that once lived here, and with poisons that will kill for years. We have fought each other for land, for wealth, for power, and we have exhausted all three in doing so.
“The three great Houses of U Maw have defeated each other and themselves in the process. I tell you that the soldiers of the Second House will fight no more. I ask the First House and the Third House to put your weapons down. They will help you no more.’
“How nice for you if we do,” shouts someone from the Third House. “I guess you want us to give you our food and children, too.”
“I want no such thing,” Naw’Ra answers, and pauses, slowing her breathing down, remembering that she has come to persuade, not to fight. “I want you to remember that before there were three Houses, there were the clans, and before the clans, there were the bands, and before that, there were just the Maw’u’I, talking animals who could not only imagine the future, but make it real. And in only 150,000 years, they settled all the lands and lived mostly in peace, however simple their life seems to us now. We are those same creatures, but we have lost our way. We let ourselves believe that peace and cooperation was stagnation and that only war and competition brought progress.”
“What do you expect us to do?” shouts a solider from the Second House. “Tear off our clothes and live like savages?”
“Our answer is to move forward. I ask your patience for a minute, and you will begin to understand. I need only your stillness and quiet.” 
Naw’Ra nods, and one soldier in each of the other houses nods in return. She and her two coconspirators anxiously search for each other’s minds. They have quietly honed this skill over many months, but never with so much on the line. Her confidence builds as she feels the first fringes of  the other minds, and then the feeling of profound connection enfolds all three of them.
 As if their three minds have a fourth, their joint consciousness, they encircle the group around them, entangling each soldier into a vibrant mental chord. 
The soldiers gasp, feeling the connection. Now Naw’Ra speaks to them directly in their minds, her thoughts and feelings mingle with theirs. After  drowning in the fear and boredom of battle, there is something about touching the core of so many others that is deeply restorative.
“Yes, you feel it now, don’t you? How little are the differences that have driven us to fight all of our lives. How unfounded are our fears of each other. Now  I know your heart and  you know mine, and we have taken the first step toward peace.”
“Yet we fight for our homes, Naw’Ri,” a scarred old veteran shouts out. “Maybe 50 years ago, we could have all gone home and forgotten it. Now, there is nowhere for most of us to go to, and we fight for the last good lands and waters. What do you propose?”
“You are right, old soldier. We need more — we need a home whose air and water doesn’t bring disease, whose land can support food. Someday, this planet will be that again, but for now, it cannot. Peace must bring progress. And so, our small group from all three houses has been working secretly on a project that will give us a new start. And now we will show you.”
All of them are still now, their minds filled with a strangely different sky, a subtley different landscape. They see a pristine world for the first time. The air tickles their nostrils, fresher than anything they have ever breathed. This new world beckons.
Soliders fall to the ground, stunned and joyful. They are looking through the eyes of a few dozen souls on this new world. They have joined the first people to leave their world. The settlers came from all three Houses. And now they are tied to none.
“Who are you?” one soldier shouts at the sky. They all feel the response.
“We are your fellow citizens, waiting for you to join us as explorers, and as builders,” says A’mon, from the new world. “Look at the red planet just above your eastern horizon. We are there, yet we can know your thoughts and feelings, too, and you can know ours, as if we were in the same room.”
“Go home to your armies and your leaders,” Naw’Ra says. “Tell them that a new era has begun.  I will train you to entangle and you will train your families, your neighbors, and yes, your leaders.  I have laid down my arms, and so have many others in the three armies. From this day, we are no longer three houses, but one — Guardians of this world. We have been fortunate to have ripped open the fabric of reality and to have seen more deeply into it than anyone before us. And now can begin the work of transforming our lives, our homes, and our future.”

October 5, 2048
Diver was pleased to see that Raefe was integrating the experience well. She’d broken the rules, but at least it hadn’t turned out badly.  Raefe was on a good track now, but would it matter? Her scans of Earth suggested escalating ecological breakdowns. Adno had been monitoring the thousands of mild entanglers on Earth and they showed definite signs of escalating social stress on humans. A billion years of Guardian history had shown those two combinations to be hard to overcome.
Maybe Green would know something. She was an ambassador, he was a timeline analyst. He could help her understand what she was up against. They were old friends, so he’d probably not be suspicious of what she was attempting. She found his mind in the local waveform.
“Hey, Green, I’m hoping you can help me understand something,” she said.
“Sure, what do you need?”
“You remember a while ago the council asked me to keep an eye on Earth?”
“Right, the planet that never stops killing itself,” he said.
“Wow, that’s harsh. Why do you say that?”
“You know why they gave you the assignment, don’t you?”
“Because I’m pretty junior and it’s kind of a marginal civilization?” Diver replied.
“Well, I’ve been saying that all along. But when you were still a cadet, Hanikori first took on Earth. He was an ambassador then.”
“Really? He never struck me as being that interested in other species. I thought he was more of an organization type.”
“Sure, now,” Green said. “He’s quite brilliant. He was the first to detect the beginnings of an advanced civilization on Earth. He felt their entanglement powers were weak, but promising. But it didn’t work out.”
“What happened?”
“He was able to make contact with several promising leaders, and they began to build a following. But he didn’t really understand the human makeup — he didn’t see that some of his contacts were not empaths at all. They were self-delusional characters who thought they had superior abilities to connect with their fellow humans. I believe in their culture they call this a ‘narcissist’ or ‘sociopath.’”
She wondered how Hanikori could mistake an empath for a sociopath — a conversation for another day.
“He must have felt terrible,” she said. “How did his assignment end?” 
“After a decade of working with them, there was a nuclear war in their year 1962. In your timeline, they call it the Cuban missile crisis because it was avoided, but we had to move more than a dozen of his contacts to more favorable timelines. Or so we thought. Some of them had their own catastrophic wars — the Middle East in 1976, Korea in 2012, Iran in 2019, Pakistan in 2023 — the list goes on. The others we transferred wound up in timelines where there was less war, but the unrestrained economic growth led to faster environmental collapse. Hanikori couldn’t take it —— he resigned and transferred to the administration wing.”
“That’s discouraging. So why did they give it to me?”
Green was uncomfortable. “Do I have to spell it out for you?”
“Maybe you do. I’m not seeing it.”
“Diver From Great Heights, I know how capable you are. But the truth is, most of the council agreed with Hanikori that Earth was a waste of time. But Far Flier can be stubborn when he thinks he’s right and he wouldn’t join that consensus. And when he assigned you, well you must know that it’s no secret that you’re more than colleagues. No one was going to buck him. So they voted with him. If it been anyone else, they would have voted it down.”
She considered what he was saying. It wasn’t impossible, but it didn’t feel right. Arguing, though, would only make it worse.
“I don’t know if that’s why I got the job,” she said evenly, ““but it’s certainly not why I’m sticking with it. I’m sorry if you think I’m just here to soothe Far Flier’s vanity. From where I’m sitting, there is some cause for optimism about Earth. But I need to understand what the timelines show. What am I up against?””
“I can give you some ideas, but I can’t give you too many specifics.”
“Feathers As Green As Third Spring Grass, I’m not an idiot. I’m not going to bring on another Orion Belt disaster, OK?”
“OK, OK, always have to give that little speech about not going back into the past to change the present. So let’s look at Earth across the timelines.”
A column of light rose from the floor, showing the metaverse of the millions of alternative universes that had Earths. Many were very similar and grouped like trees, with common roots but ending in different branches. Green was trained to read the timelines, just as she had been trained to read entanglers across the wormhole interface. Entanglement plus alternate timelines — this was the foundation of Guardian technology.
“What you see is that at the present, there are several major trees of outcomes. The largest tree shows a steady decline punctuated by various crises — war, famine, disease, all aggravated by out of control warming, predatory social structures, and a variety of lesser ills. In short, the Earth you are currently focused on. There are other smaller trees: runaway warming, leading to a Venusian climate, total nuclear annihilation, escapes to space, most of which fail. I can’t really see beyond 100 years, since there are too many variables in our model. I think you’ll agree, Earth is currently in an extremely labile period — small changes can yield big course corrections.”
“That’s about the only thing I see that’s encouraging. In the current tree, are there any signs of hope?”
“Hard to say. Ironically,  in the timelines that failed earliest, there is some regeneration.”
“That’s odd. Why would that be?”
“Well, it looks like in some timelines there was a Third World War right after the Second World War and some nuclear weapons were used. But at the time, there weren’t that many, so a full on catastrophe was avoided. There were over 300 million people killed. There was more of a nuclear autumn than a nuclear winter.  The near armageddon caused some reflection about the way forward that has yielded some fruit in several time lines. And the increased desire to avoid future catastrophes bled over into tackling the greenhouse gas problem, so climate change has been much more moderate. Plus the nuclear autumn forced an economic slowdwon that brought them some time on that front.”
“Why didn’t we focus on those worlds?”
“The Earth project started only a few years after those timelines blew up. Our models didn’t show much promise. As we usually do, we went for those timelines that were least likely to self destruct.”
She knew there was something in these humans. To survive partial annihilation on that scale and rebound was a feat on the scale of the U Maw, the first Guardians. Who would be their Na’Wra? Was it Raefe?
“Well, you’ve given me a lot to think about. We’ll talk more. I feel that you may have to get involved, rapidly, in the coming weeks or months.”

Traveller’s Perch
November 3, 2048
Diver looked out across the auditorium, filled with a dozen species of air-breathers from as many planets. The room had adapted to them, providing perches for the hawkish Rayva, long pallets for the large, bearish Mondoni, and seats of whatever size were needed by the other species. On the other side of the auditorium’s thick glass walls was what the students called The Tank — a series of liquid-filled chambers of various temperatures and chemistries for eight different marine species. She felt all of their thoughts merge into a complex waveform washing over her. Her mind rapidly adjusted and became another element in it. The cadets were eager to hear her thoughts.
“You’ve all gotten your assignments, the species you will be studying for the remainder of your training. I can sense that you all are anxious about being effective Guardians working with species that can only communicate in a limited way with you. With species that live in the world all of our ancestors lived in, whether that was 10,000 years ago, as my species, did, or one million years ago as you Alaxazayawa did, or only 700 years ago, as the HooHooHu did.
“And that world is one dominated by unenhanced experience of whatever original organic senses your assigned species have evolved with. Most will also have some electronic or mechanical aids – mine have computers, books, videos, audios and other means ––– but even those they experience through the senses.”
“How is that different than us?” one of the students asked.
“OK, class, who knows what the heaviest isotope of strontium is?”
Almost instantly, the entire class waveform resonated with “Strontium 105.”
“Correct. Your enhanced minds accessed a number of databases that contained that info, and barring corrupted data, you all knew the correct answer instantly. If you were unenhanced, some of you would know that from past experience, some of you would misremember it, some of you might not even know what the question meant. And that’s just a simple fact. Everything they learn, everything they know and remember, is through the unfaithful lens of their senses and the unreliable record of their memory.”
“But here’s the odd part,” she continued. “Eventually you will get to know an unenhanced being and you will see that they view this as natural. They will view you as less than natural, part machine, and they will be suspicious. But mostly, I want you to sense the mixture of knowledge and emotion that is their mental lifeblood, and feel how that balance is different than yours. You can get a clue from the external sensory stimuli that they create. I’ve prepared a sampling of these sorts of artificial experiences from the species called humans that I work with, but they are fairly typical of many unenhanced species.” 
She gave them a glimpse of what Raefe saw in the vids he watched, a few hours of programming that their minds could absorb in minutes. “What’s the first thing you notice about them?”
“Very imaginative!” one of the cadets exclaimed. “Their ability to build unreal yet realistic worlds is impressive. But there’s so little information embedded in them.”
“Yes, everything is sound and color. A world where people can do magical things, but they never even speculate about how,” another thought.
“But hard to ignore,” a third added. “And impossible to turn off, at least some of it.”
 “We can feel the two most important things about these experiences,” Diver summarized. “First, we can all blend our own direct experience and memory with enormous amounts of data outside our own minds.  Not so the unenhanced — they must process over time – sometimes even a lifetime – to penetrate the surface of their own experiences. Perhaps most importantly, as some of you just pointed out, up to 100% of the content of these documents and images are emotional. For example, in the vid you just watched, a fleet of human spacefighters defends their planet against a massive alien fleet. And the planet is saved. Adno, how would you interpret that?”
“They seem to have a deep fear of other species,” the large, fish-shaped female replied from the coldest of the water tanks. “And a strong need to convince themselves they can defend their planet.”
“But they’ve never contacted other species,” Toneva, one of the avian Rayva, protested. “Why would they think space holds nothing but threats? And why would an advanced species care so much about them?”
“Precisely,” Diver agreed. “And there are so many other illogical ideas in this vid. How could Earth possibly win against such a force so technically superior? No, none of that makes sense. In fact, that is not at all the point of this story. Anyone think they know what is?”
She could feel them weighing different ideas, none convincing to them. 
“No one? Don’t feel bad — younger species have their own logic. This vid is one of hundreds, if not thousands, with a similar plot. What’s important to grasp is that it details a struggle with what humans call ‘aliens’ — and in most of their languages, that word does mean other species from space, but also, and more commonly, means other humans from other political units and cultures. What the hero is literally doing in these vids is keeping someone — his family, his town, his country, his ethnic group — safe from aliens. But deep down, many humans experience this as keeping their political or cultural unit safe from the more common aliens — humans who are slightly different from them. And many other species repeat this pattern.”
“Are you saying that humans routinely destroy large groups of other humans because they are different?” Adno asked.
“Sadly, yes,” Diver said. “But all of our ancestors did the same. What I want you to try and grasp here is that the humans who would never do that, who might even vigorously oppose that, will still watch this vid and cheer for the hero and thoroughly enjoy it. They will not be aware that in part their enjoyment comes from this symbolic purging of aliens. They will feel the emotion, but they won’t be fully aware of its content. But sometime in the future, they may actively carry out this preprogramming.”
“How can they truly feel something if they are neither aware of it or understand it?” asked a student.
“You are asking that because you can get to the truth about so many things in a nanosecond and then you can form feelings based on how that truth meshes with what you already know and feel. But most young species develop a complex system of emotion and thought running in parallel, intertwining and recursive. To put it simply, ideally they act emotionally, analyze the results logically, and modify their emotions accordingly in an endless cycle. Realistically, emotions can be hard to change, truth hard to find, and yet they still must act to survive. Over time, this cause them to develop deep culturally reinforced behavioral patterns even if they eventually run counter to their true long, term survival needs. That is the most common cause of the failure of intelligent species to survive.”
She could feel the waveform rebelling against this concept. How could such species be called intelligent? They sounded more like species that had not yet crossed that threshold. A very smart predator, but not at all like real intelligent life.
“Ah, now you see how it works. They don’t conform to your notions of intelligence. So you think they are not. And from there it’s only a small step toward being willing to destroy them if they do something threatening.”
The rebellious waveform collapsed. The cadets were ashamed, which she was glad of.
“So now you have begun your training as Guardians. You begin to understand that all intelligent life takes twisted paths to develop. And that we have much work to do if we are to foster that life and avoid the traps of our ancestors.”

Winter Hill
Somerville
October 1, 2048

All Raefe could see in the dawn light was cool fire. The trees on the hills of East Somerville were in full autumn shades, diverting his view from the harbor waters that had crashed their way to the base of the hills three weeks ago. The sunrise tinted the water between the hills with similar colors. He’d come out looking for serenity and instead found a vision of a world caught between burning and drowning.
“Couldn’t sleep?” Lina asked. She stood behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist. He felt her bushy hair at the base of his neck, her breasts warming his back through his shirt.
“Can’t sleep in the glamorous DigiBrands Flood Relief Camp?” Raefe said. “Four star cots, world-class rations, best portable toilets for miles around? Why would you think that?”
“Hey, this too shall pass. We’re alive, at least.”
“Authentic, thanks to my dreams,” Raefe answered, dropping the sarcasm. He turned around to face her. “If I hadn’t woken up at 2AM that night three weeks ago, I wouldn’t have heard the sounds of the water rushing in from the harbor. We wouldn’t have made it up to the roof.”
“But we did and here we are,” Lina said, holding both his arms. “When I told you about the two years I spent in refugee camps in the South African Republic, I didn’t tell you how horrible they really were. It was much sootier than this.  So I know we can get through this.”
“Because we’ve already gotten through watching the sunrise over an ocean that used to be a mile away and now covers most of where 10 million people used to live? Because no one bothered to maintain the sea wall they built only five years ago after the exact same thing happened to Ireland when a chunk of Greenland ice slid into the ocean?” Because we’ve gotten through what 43,000 people didn’t, he thought, but couldn’t bring himself to say out loud. Nor was he ready to express how much that night had transformed him. Since then, he felt like his Voice was receiving everyone’s message inside his head, only it wasn’t words, just a jumble of emotions, like an old 20th century abstract painting filled with random colored brushstrokes. He could turn the noise up or down, but he couldn’t make it stop. Raefe worried that he was going crazy; but he was too scared to say that out loud to anyone, even Lina.
Lina was quiet, trying to choose which path to walk with him — anger, fear, sadness, resignation? It occurred to her that he had lived his whole life without having to face the unimaginable. And now it had hit him, like a sledge hammer in the gut. Could he cope?
“Because we are 20 and our lives may be sooty, but they’re ours,” she says. “And you, who always takes on the suffering of the world, now it’s your turn to look after yourself.”
“I don’t really know that means. All my life, I had these headaches, whether I ‘looked after them’ or not. Sometimes I thought I was crazy. Now my headaches have vanished. But something else has happened. I feel like an old radio tuner stuck between stations — I hear faint voices all the time. Not voices, more like tones. Fear, friendliness, greed, lust — that sort of thing. I’m exhausted but I can’t stop. I’m not as tough as you, Lina.” 
He thought of the first time he had seen her. Her SolarCycle had gotten a flat tire on the Mass Ave. Bridge during the first big snow storm in three years. Bad enough she had been riding it during a blizzard. But there she was, her wiry little self flipping the 50 kilos or so of the bike upside down so she could change the tire, gloves off, horsing the wheel nut off with a wrench. He’d stopped to help her, but she was much quicker at it than him.
She offered to buy him coffee or soup to thank him. They went to Golden Age, a retro cafe in the arty district that fringed the salty marshes along the mouth of the Charles. The restaurant recreated the 1950s as best as they could. They sat talking and drinking the strong muddy coffee from weird little coffee pots that he’d never seen before with small glass domes protruding from the top.
She told him about how she had never seen snow up close before, having grown up in the East African Republic. The restaurant had covered all the light strips with plastic so that they looked yellowy, like 20th century incandescent bulbs supposedly did. It made the room feel warmer than it was and soon the warmth and the sound of her voice began to lull him. He couldn’t take his eyes off her, from her riotous hair to her small but long-fingered hands that seemed to be translating her speech into some kind of dance language. After being out in the cold and wind, her yellow and brown hair went every which way, as if her cinnamon skin had separated itself into her mother's East African brown and her father's golden Chinese shades, and flowed like a braided river out into her hair, to glow in the antique lights of the restaurant. His gaze lasted a tad too long, causing her to run her finger self-consciously along the ropey scar tissue that capped her right ear. 
Later, he would find out that the scar was a reminder of the East African holocaust that she could never quite forget or talk about. At that moment, it had broken his reverie and made her approachable. He told her stories his father had told him about living with knee deep snow for weeks and months in far northern Vermont many years ago and by the time they had finished their second cup of coffee, they both knew they would see each other again. In the two years since, they had made a bit of a life together, one that was being sorely tested now.
She sighed, bringing him back to Somerville.
“You think I’m some kind of Sim character,” she said. “That my superpower is to endure suffering, that my scars are like insignia on a soldier’s sleeve. But soon you’ll know, too, that endurance is learned, and at a cost. We might have to tough this out for awhile. We’re fugees now, like a billion other people in a thousand other places. But these voices — it worries me. Are you going to be OK?
“I’m not sure what OK means, Lina. You want me to smile and say I’m fine?”
“I’ll settle for a smile. And there’s a whole lot of life between ‘not fine’ and ‘fine.’ That might be our address for awhile.”
I’ve disappointed her again, he thought. She wants someone tougher. He sighed. “Sad but true. Look, I don’t know about these voices. Somehow, I can glimpse what people are feeling — I’m not just imagining that. But I’ll do my best not to freak out. That’s all I can say.”
“Second best will do, too,” she smiled. “It’s not a test. It’s cold out here — come downstairs and have some of those world-class rations DigiBrands is treating us to. They’re free, don’t you know? We’ve only got to work all day to get them.”
They sat in the dining hall, a big inflatable structure with dull-colored sides, heads down with a few hundred others, eating an indifferent breakfast of weak tea, some kind of protein porridge and an orange. A woman in a shirt with a DigiBrands logo got on the bull horn and told them all where to shape up. Their crew trudged down Broadway toward the flood zone. Once it had been the main street of East Somerville, the many small shops tattooed with flexible screens that displayed their wares and tapped into your Voice to promise lowest prices, best ever, tailored just for you. Now, the screens were silent and covered with a film of grayish mud, the shops empty and their shelves no longer stocked with the makings of curry or parts for bikes or cheap 3D printed clothing. Now-feral cats roamed their insides, their yowling frustrated and angry.
Over the last three weeks, the water had receded part way, leaving most of the streets west of the interstate dry. Near the mouth of the Mystic, the remnants of a luxury condo and shopping enclave poked their way out of the expanded bay, their first few floors soon to be colonized by marine life. They had gone down to their TinyStack a week after the flood but it was ruined, their possessions buried along with Miguel. 
 Raefe could still feel the screams of those who hadn’t made it. As he replayed the night of the storm, he had come to hear more than just their screams: their shock, their anger, their disappointment as they realized the life they would not lead. Grief was an ocean that still rose to his chin, sometimes he could barely keep his nostrils clear. He turned his mind away from his thoughts, trying to focus on the simple tasks of lifting debris, piling it up, sorting it, and loading it on the appropriate truck. Salvageable metals went one place, rotten organics another, plain old dirt a third — DigiBrand would find ways to monetize all of it, not that he would ever see any of that. The day went by, the sun traversing its arc, and they trudged back up Winter Hill in the dusk. He hated that he was actually looking forward to another meal of little more than prison food, but he was tired and hungry.
That night, he and Lina snuck off to an abandoned furniture warehouse the camp residents called The Club. Unless you had kids, the camp had separate sides for male and female — if you wanted to meet the opposite sex, you had to go to The Club. They found a couch in decent shape and dragged it to a dark corner. They made love for the first time since the flood, wordlessly, happily, sleepily. For the first time since the flood, he was able to quiet his mind and not worry about his sanity or toughness; but he feared this would be a brief respite.
After, he held her face and kissed her. Holding her, he was suddenly afraid that she would tire of him and leave. “I know you think I’m a child sometimes,” he said. “Compared to you, maybe. What upsets me is not becoming a fugee. It’s living in a world of fugees.”
“Fugees are the future, don’t knock ‘em,” she said, hoping a little humor could head off another of his melancholy bouts.
“You’re scared I’m going to lose it, aren’t you,” he said, suddenly aware of her apprehension.
“Maybe,” she conceded. “I know this flood has knocked you off your feet. I was only a kid during the Efricar civil war, so I don’t remember too much. But I feel like it must be tough for you to get to our age thinking the world is a certain way and then find out it’s not at all like that.”
“I understand how you could say that, from what you’ve had to go through,” he said. “But we’ve all had our own ‘civil war’ to deal with. Mine was The Slide. Even though I was a baby, my parents never got over that. All through my childhood, I was painfully aware that something had gone terribly wrong, that my parents could do nothing about it. As I grew up, I saw the old vids of the food riots, the mobs breaking into stores, the tanks guarding the banks. And every year on the anniversary, the memorials, the fat, pious words from politicians and corpos. My parents angrily muttering at the vid screen, always feeling betrayed.”
“Trust me, that’s bad, but it’s nothing like being a slave in a camp run by genocidal maniacs.”
“I didn’t say it was.”
“Felt that way to me. I don’t need to feel you’ve been through what I’ve been through to love you, honestly.”
 “Look, I’m not trying to denigrate your experience. I was agreeing with you about finding out the world is not the way you thought it was. I’ve never lived in a world as bad as the one you escaped. But I have lived in a world that was bad enough to shatter whatever expectations my parents had, that I do know. And I see it on the faces of everyone here. They have ‘The Look’ — I can feel them staring off into a future that terrifies them.”
“OK, I think I can see that. And you’re right about the look. And the blankness — the feeling that you can’t show what you are feeling, that if we all did that, we’d collapse en masse.”
“Authentic, that’s it. And just like I’ve been carrying around The Slide as if it vaccinated me from anything worse, you carry around Efricar. And now we all have to consider that no matter what happened in the past, we’re not prepared for what’s to come.”
She nodded wordlessly, burrowing into his arms more deeply.
We’ve reached the end of words, he thought. They won’t help any more. We need to feel something new, to do something new. He listened to the distant waters, now singing a calming song. Maybe in time he could draw strength from other people’s feelings, just as he drew strength from Lina. She had drifted off to sleep. He let himself drift off, no longer afraid she’d be gone in the morning.

March 19, 2049
Raefe hadn’t heard from Lina in three weeks. At first, he chalked it up to her being out in the bush somewhere around Kiunga. A quick look at the satmaps showed there was, indeed, a lot of bush around Kiunga and little else. But if he’d woken up worried, he was beside himself now. Overnight he’d gotten a message from her mother, who had heard through the Chinese government that she had escaped a kidnapping and was safe, but now somewhere in the bush.
It was almost 6 months now since he had been with her, in their other life, on that island, minutes from death. How had they let it go this long and not found a way to get together? He closed the window shade, turned off the room light. He folded his bed back into a couch and sat on the edge, as quiet and still as he could. He closed his eyes and thought of her face. A moment from when they had just met returned, one of the few memories he had of that life that was older than a year. They were sitting at a coffee cart in Union Square; he couldn’t quite remember the name. It was a beautiful spring day and the coffee exploded in his mouth in a shower of bitter, chocolate, and molasses foam. He smiled and she laughed. Her face filled his mind’s eye — her anarchic curls, her cinammon skin, the slightly square nose that seemed neither African or Chinese — and a fountain of longing burst from inside him toward the sky.
And then he felt something back. A brush of fingertips raising the hair on the back of his neck. A whisper in his ear making him alert. A keening. And then it was gone.
He sat frozen, afraid to move even a millimeter. After a minute or two, he felt the desperation of knowing she might not come back and a cry flew out from inside him. Had he actually shouted it, or was it just in his head? He wasn’t sure.
“Raefe, are you OK?”
Who was it? A woman’s voice, not Lina’s. A neighbor?
“Can you hear me?”
It was Diver.
“Yes, I forget sometimes you can come when I’m awake. You heard me crying out?”
“I heard both of you.”
“You heard Lina?”
“Yes, she heard you but could not hold on to your thoughts.”
“Wow, I didn’t expect her empathic powers to be that strong. I was really just reaching out in desperation, no expectations.”
“You both are much stronger now. Empathy builds its own strength.”
“You have to tell me — is she OK?”
“Yes, tired but safe. She can tell you all about it.”
“I don’t think I can wait until I see her. I’m going crazy here.”
“I will find her and connect you,” realizing in that moment that this was what Far Flier had done on Truro Island. Yes, but I am only strengthening an existing entanglement, not rewiring someone’s brain without their knowledge. Yet she realized she would do exactly that in this moment if that was what it would take to keep Raefe going. I am no better than Far Flier, it would seem.
Only a few seconds later, Raefe felt fully another mind. He had never experienced more than his one to ones with Diver. It took him a second to tease out the two streams. Now he could sense Lina, and his head was filled with warm light. He had a million questions and he sensed that so did she. He tried to speak, but he felt her thoughts flooding into his mind and great streams of ideas flowing out of him toward her. Seconds, minutes, many minutes — he had no idea — passed and then he felt his mind settle.
“I will leave you now,” Diver said. “I think you have much to say to each other and little to me.”

Diver gazed out over endless sea, the wind whipping her feathered crest.
“Once our ancestors could cross that ocean with no tech at all,” Far Flier said. “Now, we wouldn’t get far at all with these engineered flight suits.”
“Funny how the ocean is now harder for us to cross than space itself,” Diver said. “Now that we all live on this continent, we have little reason to go to the other continents. And there’s machines to take us there when we do. Still, it’s been years since I soared over open water. Do you want to glide for awhile?”
“I have a better idea. Well, at least a different one. Can you swim?”
“Can you?”
“Yes, centuries ago I visited Water Eye for some Guardian business. You have a student from there — Adno.”
“Right. The water world.”
“They have small floating platforms for visitors, but after awhile I felt stupid asking them to come to the edge of the platform every time we wanted to meet. Our flight suits have a fail-safe mode for water, did you know that?”
“No, I didn’t.”
“Well, if you go too deep they warn you. If they detect that you’re hurt or unconscious, they slowly move you to the surface. This is in case you fall into the water flying through the canyons. But it will work in the ocean, too. So I decided I would see how our ancestors might have felt, going underwater to look for schools of fish.”
“That must have made Adno’s people feel good,” she said, remembering that Adno’s people had little taste for the ironic.
“Indeed. Fortunately, we were strongly entangled and they understood I meant them no harm. They may not be the most subtle species among the Guardians, but they don’t confuse us with the flying fish of their world that prey on them. Anyway, after our long flight here, I think you’ll love the wonderful cooling feel of the water.”
They dove off of the edge of the cliff, circling down against thermals rising from the water. They were only 20 meters from the water now. The wind whipping the water would drown out any conversation, but Far Flier’s thoughts reached her just fine.
“Watch what I do and follow me,” he thought. And he headed straight down into the water, a plume shooting up almost to her as the water closed around her feet. 
She tucked her wings in and stretched her feet to the sky. The water came fast and pushed her face back into her head, just for a second, and then she was wet and cool and weightless in a world of deep bluish green. She sensed Far Flier off to her right and watched how he used his limbs to navigate in the water. She turned to follow him down a few meters. Strange spongey rock towers  rose from the bottom, and all manner of small marine creatures swam around and through the holes in the towers. Far Flier took them closer. The water had currents like the air,  only they were thick and viscous to move through. Everything slowed down. The towers were alive, she could feel their energy. Many schools of fish circled the towers, occasionally passing through each other as if some quantum field kept them from touching. Now and then, the light from above lit up the fish. She was enchanted.
“Come,” Far Flier’s thoughts said. “Our enhancements will only allow us to stay under for a short time.”
He kicked upward toward the surface, his wings clearing the water and immediately grabbing the air for a lift as his enhanced legs thrust free of the water. She followed suit and amazingly, was airborne again. She let the rising currents take her back to the cliff.
“Wow, why have I waited 400 years to do that?” she said. “That was amazing. A whole other world under our beaks.”
 “Well, I’m glad you suggested this little picnic. Have some rainbow fish.” He passed her a container with several of the small fish, seasoned with herbs. “My life recently has been quite turbulent. Nice to be out here with just you, so quiet and peaceful.”
“I sensed that you had something on your mind,” she said. “What’s going on?”
“I don’t know where to start. I had wanted to talk to you about one thing, and then something else happened and now I’m very conflicted.”
“Maybe I can help sort it out. What was it you originally wanted to talk about?”
 &quot;It may seem odd, after I tell you the second. But anyway, do you know how long I have been a Guardian?&quot;
&quot;Since before I became an ambassador, but no, I don’t know how long.”
&quot;It's been more than eleven centuries.&quot;
Ah, now she understood. &quot;So you will transform soon?&quot;
&quot;In a year or two, I will change to a female.&quot;
&quot;And you’re worried that we cannot be lovers then?&quot;
&quot;Who knows? Our hearts will go whichever way they want. Either way, we will be friends. After our recent conflict, I realized how rare it is to find someone who both loves you and challenges you. And how much I cherish that.”
“And I, as well. In both directions — love and challenge. I think you’ll be a wonderful girlfriend for me, and not my first. So you can rest easy on that score.”
“Good to know. The point is, it has been a long time since I fathered a child. It would mean a great deal to me if you would join with me for that, before I change. It will be a long time into the future before I can mother my own child, and I don’t want to wait that long to be a parent again. I’m feeling the need to leave more behind than just memories.&quot;
In only her fourth century, she had never thought much about birthing a child. Far Flier was her first lover who had even passed into parent status.
“Wow. My first reaction is, frankly, awe. None of my childhood friends have reproduced. I haven’t had to think about it much.”
“And you may not want to when I tell you the rest.”
He recounted Hanikori’s ultimatum.
“Far Flier, I’m so sorry that it’s come to this. How can I help?”
“Help? I don’t think you can, as far as stopping him. He has won, for now. I will have to find a way to step down, and make it look like I’m just stepping aside for a time. I will remain a Guardian, but a quiet one, while I watch and wait. Hanikori, he is another story. I am beginning to believe he is a rare bird.”
“How so?”
“Of course, you can’t repeat this for now. But I believe he is insane, or at the least, mentally unbalanced.”
“How can that be? We were all raised to believe that mental illness had been eliminated thousands of years ago. That our entanglements and our enhancements and all of our technology make it impossible for our minds to go so far out of balance as to be what you say.”
“I don’t know how it can be. But the facts are there and disturbing. His bizarre record on Earth, where most of his prized contacts turned out to be psycopathic dictators like Kim Jong Il — you should read up on him and you’ll understand what I mean. His current project. His penchant for dramatic confrontations. More and more, I’ve come to believe one hypothesis explains them all.”
“So you’ve discovered the true nature of his current project?”
“Not completely. But at least one piece of it I know: he wants to abstract consciousness from the body.”
“Don’t we do that now, when we travel through the wormhole interface?”
“No, not at all. You project thoughts and feelings from your consciousness, but it stays firmly rooted in your body. Imagine if your mind was literally elsewhere.”
“What would be the point?”
“I don’t know. But it seems insane, doesn’t it? To split the mind and body that way?’
“Yes, I agree. And deeply troubling. How can you give the Guardian leadership over to him if that’s true?”
“I’ve thought long and hard about this. We’re not used to dishonest conflict, to sneak attacks. But that’s what Hanikori is orchestrating, I’m sure. And at some point, the Guardians who still hold to our original mission must launch a sneak counter attack. Which means feigning surrender in order to eventually defeat him and his allies, whoever they are.”
“You are so brave, Far Flier. In 10,000 years, no one has had to do this.”
“Sadly, in the nearly billion years since Na’wra’s Explorers discovered other intelligent life and founded the Guardians, situations like this have occurred from time to time, even if not on our world. Part of my initiation as head of the council was to read the ancient archives and to learn how prior leaders met these sorts of challenges. So, what you call bravery is just what I have prepared for quietly for centuries.”
“Call it what you like, it will require courage.”
“And I fear, companionship. When I imagine what lies ahead, you are always in the picture.”
“You know I have deep feelings for you, Far Flier. I want to say yes to what you are suggesting, even if I don’t know exactly what it means.”
“It means that we would lead a dual life for decades, perhaps centuries. The life people will see is that of two minor Guardian officials, not very important people, going about their work, perhaps raising a child. The life only a few will know is being part of a shadow Guardian organization that monitors and ultimately resists whatever Hanikori is planning.”
“I don’t think I should answer this now. This is an occasion to enter alakh, to go deep inside and know my mind as fully as I can. When I emerge from it, you will know my mind.”
“That is all that I can ask now, that you know your mind and be true to it and share it with me.”

May 4, 2049

Raefe had never experienced much dissonance between the parts of his mind he had been born with in this world and the old one during the seven months they had coexisted. Diver’s promise that they would slowly merge appeared to be coming true. But the eight-hour long plane ride from Boston seemed to provoke a sorting of the two. Neither had ever traveled to another part of the world, nor taken a supersonic jet.
One loved the high-altitude acceleration, the boom and the quiet that followed. The other could only think of how broken down travel had been in his old world. A flight like this would have involved enormous amounts of carbon credits. If it had even been available, only a handful of people would have had the wealth to take it. Most likely, this trip would have meant a solar-assisted sailboat across the ocean, and then a hodge-podge of low-carbon land transit for someone of his means. It would have taken a month, which meant few people would ever have made the trip. Just the rich, who could purchase carbon credits as readily as anything else.
Raefe found himself fighting the idea that this world was headed that way. After all, it had been a great accomplishment only 20 years ago when supersonics had cut global travel times in half. And in another 20 years, this flight would be ultrasonic and the farthest flights would be hypersonic. Boston to Nairobi? Four hours. Boston to Sydney? Three hours tops. This was a clever world. He wanted to believe that the other Earth had merely been stupid or blind, or gripped by some dysfunctional ideology. 
The newer part of his mind assured him that everyone in the old world thought the same things in his great-grandparent’s day, when the temperatures first began to rise to dangerous levels and the predictions of global catastrophe were scoffed at by many. He stared out the window, trying to calm himself. The whole debate was giving him a headache. He’d never had one of his seizures in this world, but the other him remembered them and let it drop.
He took out his puter and read through the code he had delivered to Elise yesterday. He done everything she had asked, creating an entire second sim with completely different algorithms. At first he hadn’t cared much about what the algorithms were. At MiniWorlds, he often didn’t understand the math their clients wanted installed in their games. No matter, all he needed to understand was what were the inputs and what were they outputs. The algorithms themselves were black boxes.
But Joe Nguyen was the sort of person who wanted to explain everything to you. And little by little, Raefe had begun to see how Joe’s code tried to model parts of the world. It was a subtle and complex set of interacting rules, the answers to one rule weighting the inputs to the next, but also modifying itself. How else can we capture the effects of the individual on the group and vice versa, Joe had said. This is the math of the paradox between collaboration and competition, he had proclaimed, with some pride.
And yet Raefe had been left feeling that Nguyen had missed something. Because Nguyen, like most humans, lived with a huge imbalance between the strength of his own thoughts and feelings and those of everyone else. Raefe now lived in that gap between himself and everyone else. And it had made him much more aware. So many things influenced how he perceived other people that he had not been aware of before meeting Diver. Things that he had once thought were his own thoughts, but were really a blend of everyone’s thoughts. What else was culture, after all?
He skimmed through the code, still not able to put his finger on what was missing. Culture was all over Joe’s code, that was not the problem. He read closer, looking to see how Joe had envisioned the workings of culture. And then he saw it. Joe had missed the most important ingredient of all.
Empathy. The simple human — well, let’s be honest, mammalian — ability to see ourselves in other people is just not here, he thought. It just doesn’t attach any power to this. Because, after all, in our society, we think of empathy as something nice people feel toward the less fortunate, when they’re relaxed and have nothing better to do. But Raefe knew that empathy was much more fundamental to life, and therefore to society. The sim would still fall short, he thought.
He fell asleep wondering what a sim that accounted for empathy on a mass scale would be like.

In Nairobi, he’d taken a taxi into the city center. From there, it was a 6 hour bus ride straight down the A3 to Garissa. He’d never been to Africa, but from vids and school, he expected to see a necklace of bustling small cities extending out from the capital, filled with low industrial parks made of dozens of agritech plants. For the first hour, he felt like he’d never left Nairobi as they drove through endless neighborhoods with people packed into a random patchwork of shanties, container houses and tent cities. He guessed more people lived here, just on the eastern edge of Nairobi, then all of Boston.
But the houses thinned and then there was nothing for awhile. Flat as far as the eye could see, most of the trees had been cut down for firewood or farming long ago. An hour out of Nairobi, the air had turned hot and dry. He’d once been to Arizona and this felt like that. Then, suddenly about 200 kilometers from Nairobi, Mwingi City rose up out of the dust like a mini Nairobi. And then it was gone and they were back to hard-baked dust with the occasional small village.
A little later, he saw another city on the horizon on the horizon and signs for Bangali City. When they got closer, he could see that the city was deserted. Some farmers were walking a flock of goats down one of the streets. A hot breeze blew dust and various dead plants and garbage through the streets, but nothing else moved.
And then they pulled into Garissam, a town like so many towns at the end of a road. His puter said Dadaab was only another two hours down the road, but his puter didn’t know that normal traffic east of Garissa had stopped a decade ago. Between Garissa and Dadaab, drought had driven even all but the smallest village farmers out. Bandit gangs had taken their place, some of whom were affiliated with remnants of the jihadi militias that had plagued the region decades ago. They made dirt bike runs to attack trucks or the market in Garissa, and then disappeared back into the scrub. All in all, a dangerous place, he thought, anxious about Lina’s safety.
At the bus station, four men with motorcycles approached him. His stomach clutched for a second and then he sensed they were friendly. One of them introduced himself as Malik in halting English and explained Lina had sent them to bring him to Dadaab. Malik gestured to the back of his bike, and Raefe hopped on. He noticed two of the men had short machine pistols slung over their their chests.
Villages remained scarce. Twice, they’d skirted a village by riding off road. He’d tried to ask why, but the noise of four dirt bikes with ancient, rusting mufflers made it impossible. He could feel something between wariness and fear in his companions’ thoughts.
It’s begun, he thought. The heat, the drought, the breakdown. It’s already happened here.
And then there was a bit of forest and the land rose gently. The forest thickened. They reached a ridge and there it was below, the remains of Dadaab, where 400,000 people had once lived. He could feel many minds below. They felt ordinary, just people going about their business, and it made him very happy.
And then there was Lina, only 100 meters away talking to some people. She must have sensed him because she turned, a huge smile on her face. He hopped off the bike, yelling his thanks to Malik as he trotted toward Lina. He grabbed her up in big bear hug. She was warm and lean and slighter than he had remembered. Gone was the riot of curls, replaced by neat rows. 
“Easy,” she thought to him. “Public affection not so great here.”
He relaxed his hug and she moved back just slightly. They stood grinning at each other.
“Come,” she said, “Let’s get you some water.”
The dining tent was empty and they sat down. He took a long sip of water. Their minds were fully engaged with each other and it felt somehow odd. And then he realized something.
“There are four of us here,” he thought to her. “The two of us who were lovers, and the two of us who have just met.”
“Lina meet Raefe,” she thought.
“Raefe meet Lina, “ he replied. “I think you’re going to like her.”
“Sitting in Union Square, talking fugee biz with Kayam, I never imagined we’d be sitting here,” she said.
“How’s the coffee?” he teased.
“What coffee?” she said. “The heat has killed off most of the lower elevation trees. The high mountain beans are too expensive for locals — it gets shipped off to Europe. Sometimes we get some from Ethiopa, but  bandits have ripped off the last two shipments.”
“Doesn’t seem right, no coffee practically in the place where coffee started.”
“No, my love,” she said. “All is not right here.”
He could feel her sadness, different than what she had felt in their old life when she thought of the Efricar Holocaust. Farther from anger, but wider and deeper. He stared out from the tent. Past Dadaab, the trees were low and sparse as far as he could see, which was all the way to the horizon. There, the line between land and sky was smudged by dust. It reminded him of the beach just after sunset, when water, clouds and sky all converged in slatey blur.
“You thought it would all be jungle and mountains,” Lina laughed.
“Yes, majestic,” he grinned.
“It is the beginning of the changes that destroyed our first life,” she said. “In a generation or two, the fertile coast will be underwater. And this will be a vast desert, a young Sahara.”
“And Nowhere will be nothing?” he wondered.
“Nowhere will be everywhere,” she answered. “Millions, maybe billions, of people will be like these people. Wandering with no destination, no home.”
“Will it be like the East African Holocaust of your other childhood?”
“I don’t remember much of that. I can sense a good deal of it from you since we came to this timeline — your memories of my telling are strong. I can feel some of them, so I know what you are asking. And I don’t know. These people have so far avoided death from  Shabab, their own governments, and now even the Chinese. But when there are tens of millions of them, what will happen?”
“History says something awful,” he answered. “Can they — can we — change that?”
“I want to think we can,” she said. “I have learned a great deal from these people. They don’t wake up every day with voices all around them telling them to buy, to fight, to be better than the next. They only have each other, and a lifetime of shit has taught them to cherish that.”
“This time last year, we were living in a Bunk under the highway in Somerville. Happiness was a Cubano from Kiko and Kayam’s food trike. Six months ago, we stood at the beginning of the end. Now I’m looking at where the first people lived. And thinking about changing history. Some days, it’s all too weird.”
“I don’t imagine they signed up for this either,” Lina said, jerking her head toward the camp.
“No, you’re right. What do you think we should do?”
“I want to stay here, and be a part of this. I feel like they’re on the verge of something really different.”
He nodded. “I’ve only just got here, but I understand your attraction. And soon I’ll have to go home.”
“Not so soon. We have time to experience, and talk and decide the way forward. I have learned patience from these people.”
He looked skeptical.
“Don’t worry, Raefe,” she laughed. “It can be taught.”
Later that night, they walked back up the hill into the forest.
“I think it’s time we introduce new Lina to new Raefe,” Lina said, pointing to a  glade of soft ferns.
Not a stranger at all, thought Raefe a few minutes later  as they left normal conversation behind. Old memories, new thoughts, the ancient delight of warm bodies, the soft battle between rising passions and the desire to make it last forever, their occasional cries all mixed in a sweet gumbo of forest bird calls.
Lying on the ferns, Raefe began to drift off, the warm breeze and Lina’s warm skin merging and lulling him. He began to dream of Lina, naked and glowing, flowing over him, enveloping him. He felt the warmth that was his love for her flow from his mind, down his spine, and through his sex into her. At the same time, he felt her love flowing back toward him, a whirlpool of sensations and emotions where they were joined. His new self guided him, showing the part of him that was strange to her all the places that gave her pleasure. She responded by letting him feel how he felt to her. He returned the favor and they both broke the silence with a laugh. What a strange and wondrous thing this coupling thing was!
The laughter woke him up. He opened his eyes and realized he hadn’t been dreaming, or even really sleeping. Lina had mounted his drowsy body as he lay there but this time their minds had joined too. Now he could see her, and the forest and the sky but had no wish to be distracted from the allness of her. He felt like a newly blind man who had discovered that the world could be seen through touch and taste and smell. As he thought that, he felt her thinking the same thing, and their bodies moved together without hesitation or doubt.
Finally, sated, they lay back, still breathing together. It was still night, but the sun would come up on their new world.</Text>

            <Text>Bad dreams
Somerville, Massachusetts
September 5, 2048
People were screaming all around him, so many and so far away that he couldn’t see them all, he could just feel their terror envelop him. Something awful was happening down near the harbor. He could hear metal bending, then shredding. He heard water, lots of it, banging cars around, getting louder, so many sounds. Above it all, he could feel the fear and horror of thousands of people hearing those same terrifying sounds. 
Raefe bolted awake, sweating, temples pounding as they always did when he had these visions. He started the deep breathing exercises the therapy bot had given him. Even awake, he could hear rain lashing the walls of their little building. Must be the remnants of that hurricane, it’s just a storm, he thought. But why did he still feel the screams of drowning people?  It’s not a dream, he realized, stunned. He shook Lina.
“Get up! We have to get to the roof.”
He yanked her arm, pulling her up out of the bed. She grabbed her Voice and they ran up the back stairs in their underwear, yelling “Wake up, get to the roof!” to the people who lived on the top floor of their TinyStack, banging ferociously on the door as they ran by. The water was so loud that they could barely hear their feet on the stairs.
They got to the roof, Kiko and Kayam right behind them. The hurricane drove sheets of rain toward them. They bent into the wind, trying to see what was happening. They could barely see  that the usual bright necklace of lights and gates of the harbor sea wall had disappeared. The sea had already pushed the Mystic River fast over its banks, churning inland past their home. Looking down, there was nothing below their second story apartment but water.
Huge waves slammed the shore. Cars pinballed silently into buildings, the rending of metal inaudible beneath the storm. A Coast Guard cutter surfed a 10 meter wave, headed from Boston Harbor toward the Mystic Tobin Bridge. The ship twisted and for a minute it looked like it would pass under the bridge that towered 50 meters above it. Then the water threw the boat back into the farthest pillar. A mile away, they heard the sound of the bridge straining over the roar of the water. The pillar bent, twisting the whole bridge. That freed the ship to continue on until it smashed into a building only blocks away.
They searched for a way off of the roof, panicked by the sight of 5 meters of sea water filling the streets all around them. And dawn was still hours away. 
“We’ve got to get out of here,” Lina screamed over the noise. “I don’t know if the TinyStack will hold in this.”
“There, look,” Kiko shouted back, point to a track for maintenance bots on the elevated highway running only meters above their heads. “There’s a ladder on that pillar, we can climb up to the highway.”
They grabbed the rungs built into the stanchion and climbed up. Through the drowned air a ragged column of survivors was just visible on the interstate. The rain was everywhere, there was no escape from its driving needles. They turned their backs on the flood and merged with the other survivors, marching north, away from the harbor.
Raefe put his hand on Lina’s back, his white hand like a flashlight on her brown hair and back, and he followed it through the rain.  But he couldn’t stop the flood of images from the other survivors, the people that hundreds of others were seeing. Broken limbs, sobbing, and worse.  His mind was wracked by a kind of lightning that brought a thunder of drowned screams.
They got to the top of a big hill. Seeing the emptiness in Raefe’s face, Lina shook him.
“It’s OK, we’re safe,” she said. “We made it.”
He nodded but wondered, When will the screams stop? He felt an animal fright spread out over the land, a fright with no discernible end. He let it wash over him, bits of anguish, sadness and desperation rushing by like broken twigs on the water. He had never felt anything close to the depth and breadth of these feelings. He wanted it to go away — usually even a hint of this would send his brain spiraling into migraine-like waves of pain and nausea. But something had changed, like a blurry vid had suddenly snapped into focus. With every step, his mind could feel some minds recede, and others move closer.
Lina pulled him by the hand away from the column of survivors to a small knoll next to the road. They turned and looked back over East Somerville, now a drowned urban swamp lit by a full moon. There were no more streets, just dirty water and short buildings like fat trees sticking out of it. Beyond their neighborhood was more of the same as far as they could see.
“So this is what the apocalypse looks like,” Kayam said, his arms wrapped tight around himself. “The beginning of the end.”
“Yeah, and where’s Jesus?” Lina answered, her voice angry in the dark. Kayam’s religious bent always put her off.
“No, no Jesus coming,” Kayam said. “Not like that. This is no free trip to heaven for the true believers. No, this is man’s work, not God’s.  Look around — you’re telling me this isn’t the end of our world? You think we’re the only people right now standing on a hill looking at something like this?”
Raefe  asked what no one had wanted to. “Do you think Miguel got out of the first floor?”
“No way,” Kayam said. “Water was already over the back door when we got to the roof.”
“Rest in peace, Migs,” Lina said. “Sorry we didn’t have more time to get to know you.”
“Shit, Kiko,” Raefe suddenly realized, “Where’s your food trike?”
“Serving the fishes,” she said. “You’re going to have to find a new place to get Cubanos and Korean barbecue.”
“Starting to see your point, Kayam,” Lina said. “Maybe this is the end of the world.”
Raefe smiled absently, registering Lina’s ability to snark even in the midst of the apocalypse. But his attention was fixed on the only home he’d ever had since leaving his parents. From here, their little TinyStack just looked like a bright painted shipping container floating under a bridge, as if it had fallen off a ship passing by.
The first light of day brought a dull, gray shine to the city. Traffic was sparse. Lina’s Voice finally found the Net. She sent a text to her parents in Sofricar and gave her Voice to Raefe to call his family. In Raefe’s ear it was loose, smaller than his, but he jammed his finger in to make it fit. He talked to it quietly, resetting it to work for him. The Voice took awhile, but it was able to get through to Oregon. 
“Dad, it’s Raefe. Just wanted to let you know I’m OK.”
“Thank goodness—we were so scared. I’m seeing some crazy stuff on the Net — 10 million people homeless, no power to 100 million all up and down the East Coast?”
“I don’t know, Dad. My puter’s lost in the flood, we had to leave in a hurry. I’m using Lina’s Voice. We just walked all night to get out of the flood. We’re standing on hill in the middle of. . . I don’t really know. I’m hoping some cops come by, or anyone who knows where we should go.”
“It’s chaos, Raefe. They’re saying the government can’t even find its own people. Digi and Brightstar Defense and some other big corpos say they’re going to help. You know how that works — have a problem and call Brightstar for help, now you’ve got two problems.”
“It just keeps getting worse, doesn’t it, Dad.”
“I’m afraid so, son.”
Raefe could see him, sitting in their apartment in the endless townhouse flats south of Eugene, staring out at the wind farms on the ridge. On the wall, the photo screen of Justin Miller and Charlotte Epstein holding newborn Raefe, big brother Benny looking up, standing in front of a brownstone in Brooklyn. 
He loved that picture. They’re smiling about their future, a vivid LED glow of warm colors. No one thought that The Slide was only months away. A secret US weapons test in space would cause a massive communications satellite failure. The Net would disappear for six weeks, tipping the creaky world financial system down the long incline it was still on.  Millions of Justins and Charlottes — billions around the world — would never have a full time job again. Nor would they ever smile quite as effortlessly.
“Just tell mom I’m thinking of you guys. I can see that picture on the wall, you smiling at mom.” he said. “Don’t forget that smile. You give mom and Benny my love.”
“Will do. You take care of yourself. And say hi to Lina.”
Raefe felt the heartbreak behind his dad’s robotic goodbye. He wondered, is there a right thing to say at a time like this? He turned to Lina and Kayam and Kiko.
“My dad says the Net is crazy with rumors. One hundred million without power, 10 million homeless. Corpos already feasting on the carcass.”
He stood numb, feeling like a giant antenna receiving a million channels, all with bad news. Yesterday he was just another kid struggling to find work and keep it together. Today they were all human driftwood washed up on an alien shoreline.





Winter Hill
October 1, 2048

All Raefe could see in the dawn light was cool fire. The trees on the hills of East Somerville were in full autumn shades, diverting his view from the harbor waters that had crashed their way to the base of the hills three weeks ago. The sunrise tinted the water between the hills with similar colors. He’d come out looking for serenity and instead found a vision of a world caught between burning and drowning.
“Couldn’t sleep?” Lina asked. She stood behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist. He felt her bushy hair at the base of his neck, her breasts warming his back through his shirt.
“Can’t sleep in the glamorous DigiBrands Flood Relief Camp?” Raefe said. “Four star cots, world-class rations, best portable toilets for miles around? Why would you think that?”
“Hey, this too shall pass. We’re alive, at least.”
“Authentic, thanks to my dreams,” Raefe answered, dropping the sarcasm. He turned around to face her. “If I hadn’t woken up at 2AM that night three weeks ago, I wouldn’t have heard the sounds of the water rushing in from the harbor. We wouldn’t have made it up to the roof.”
“But we did and here we are,” Lina said, holding both his arms. “When I told you about the two years I spent in refugee camps in the South African Republic, I didn’t tell you how horrible they really were. It was much sootier than this.  So I know we can get through this.”
“Because we’ve already gotten through watching the sunrise over an ocean that used to be a mile away and now covers most of where 10 million people used to live? Because no one bothered to maintain the sea wall they built only five years ago after the exact same thing happened to Ireland when a chunk of Greenland ice slid into the ocean?” Because we’ve gotten through what 43,000 people didn’t, he thought, but couldn’t bring himself to say out loud. Nor was he ready to express how much that night had transformed him. Since then, he felt like his Voice was receiving everyone’s message inside his head, only it wasn’t words, just a jumble of emotions, like an old 20th century abstract painting filled with random colored brushstrokes. He could turn the noise up or down, but he couldn’t make it stop. Raefe worried that he was going crazy; but he was too scared to say that out loud to anyone, even Lina.
Lina was quiet, trying to choose which path to walk with him — anger, fear, sadness, resignation? It occurred to her that he had lived his whole life without having to face the unimaginable. And now it had hit him, like a sledge hammer in the gut. Could he cope?
“Because we are 20 and our lives may be sooty, but they’re ours,” she says. “And you, who always takes on the suffering of the world, now it’s your turn to look after yourself.”
“I don’t really know that means. All my life, I had these headaches, whether I ‘looked after them’ or not. Sometimes I thought I was crazy. Now my headaches have vanished. But something else has happened. I feel like an old radio tuner stuck between stations — I hear faint voices all the time. Not voices, more like tones. Fear, friendliness, greed, lust — that sort of thing. I’m exhausted but I can’t stop. I’m not as tough as you, Lina.” 
He thought of the first time he had seen her. Her SolarCycle had gotten a flat tire on the Mass Ave. Bridge during the first big snow storm in three years. Bad enough she had been riding it during a blizzard. But there she was, her wiry little self flipping the 50 kilos or so of the bike upside down so she could change the tire, gloves off, horsing the wheel nut off with a wrench. He’d stopped to help her, but she was much quicker at it than him.
She offered to buy him coffee or soup to thank him. They went to Golden Age, a retro cafe in the arty district that fringed the salty marshes along the mouth of the Charles. The restaurant recreated the 1950s as best as they could. They sat talking and drinking the strong muddy coffee from weird little coffee pots that he’d never seen before with small glass domes protruding from the top.
She told him about how she had never seen snow up close before, having grown up in the East African Republic. The restaurant had covered all the light strips with plastic so that they looked yellowy, like 20th century incandescent bulbs supposedly did. It made the room feel warmer than it was and soon the warmth and the sound of her voice began to lull him. He couldn’t take his eyes off her, from her riotous hair to her small but long-fingered hands that seemed to be translating her speech into some kind of dance language. After being out in the cold and wind, her yellow and brown hair went every which way, as if her cinnamon skin had separated itself into her mother's East African brown and her father's golden Chinese shades, and flowed like a braided river out into her hair, to glow in the antique lights of the restaurant. His gaze lasted a tad too long, causing her to run her finger self-consciously along the ropey scar tissue that capped her right ear. 
Later, he would find out that the scar was a reminder of the East African holocaust that she could never quite forget or talk about. At that moment, it had broken his reverie and made her approachable. He told her stories his father had told him about living with knee deep snow for weeks and months in far northern Vermont many years ago and by the time they had finished their second cup of coffee, they both knew they would see each other again. In the two years since, they had made a bit of a life together, one that was being sorely tested now.
She sighed, bringing him back to Somerville.
“You think I’m some kind of Sim character,” she said. “That my superpower is to endure suffering, that my scars are like insignia on a soldier’s sleeve. But soon you’ll know, too, that endurance is learned, and at a cost. We might have to tough this out for awhile. We’re fugees now, like a billion other people in a thousand other places. But these voices — it worries me. Are you going to be OK?
“I’m not sure what OK means, Lina. You want me to smile and say I’m fine?”
“I’ll settle for a smile. And there’s a whole lot of life between ‘not fine’ and ‘fine.’ That might be our address for awhile.”
I’ve disappointed her again, he thought. She wants someone tougher. He sighed. “Sad but true. Look, I don’t know about these voices. Somehow, I can glimpse what people are feeling — I’m not just imagining that. But I’ll do my best not to freak out. That’s all I can say.”
“Second best will do, too,” she smiled. “It’s not a test. It’s cold out here — come downstairs and have some of those world-class rations DigiBrands is treating us to. They’re free, don’t you know? We’ve only got to work all day to get them.”
They sat in the dining hall, a big inflatable structure with dull-colored sides, heads down with a few hundred others, eating an indifferent breakfast of weak tea, some kind of protein porridge and an orange. A woman in a shirt with a DigiBrands logo got on the bull horn and told them all where to shape up. Their crew trudged down Broadway toward the flood zone. Once it had been the main street of East Somerville, the many small shops tattooed with flexible screens that displayed their wares and tapped into your Voice to promise lowest prices, best ever, tailored just for you. Now, the screens were silent and covered with a film of grayish mud, the shops empty and their shelves no longer stocked with the makings of curry or parts for bikes or cheap 3D printed clothing. Now-feral cats roamed their insides, their yowling frustrated and angry.
Over the last three weeks, the water had receded part way, leaving most of the streets west of the interstate dry. Near the mouth of the Mystic, the remnants of a luxury condo and shopping enclave poked their way out of the expanded bay, their first few floors soon to be colonized by marine life. They had gone down to their TinyStack a week after the flood but it was ruined, their possessions buried along with Miguel. 
 Raefe could still feel the screams of those who hadn’t made it. As he replayed the night of the storm, he had come to hear more than just their screams: their shock, their anger, their disappointment as they realized the life they would not lead. Grief was an ocean that still rose to his chin, sometimes he could barely keep his nostrils clear. He turned his mind away from his thoughts, trying to focus on the simple tasks of lifting debris, piling it up, sorting it, and loading it on the appropriate truck. Salvageable metals went one place, rotten organics another, plain old dirt a third — DigiBrand would find ways to monetize all of it, not that he would ever see any of that. The day went by, the sun traversing its arc, and they trudged back up Winter Hill in the dusk. He hated that he was actually looking forward to another meal of little more than prison food, but he was tired and hungry.
That night, he and Lina snuck off to an abandoned furniture warehouse the camp residents called The Club. Unless you had kids, the camp had separate sides for male and female — if you wanted to meet the opposite sex, you had to go to The Club. They found a couch in decent shape and dragged it to a dark corner. They made love for the first time since the flood, wordlessly, happily, sleepily. For the first time since the flood, he was able to quiet his mind and not worry about his sanity or toughness; but he feared this would be a brief respite.
After, he held her face and kissed her. Holding her, he was suddenly afraid that she would tire of him and leave. “I know you think I’m a child sometimes,” he said. “Compared to you, maybe. What upsets me is not becoming a fugee. It’s living in a world of fugees.”
“Fugees are the future, don’t knock ‘em,” she said, hoping a little humor could head off another of his melancholy bouts.
“You’re scared I’m going to lose it, aren’t you,” he said, suddenly aware of her apprehension.
“Maybe,” she conceded. “I know this flood has knocked you off your feet. I was only a kid during the Efricar civil war, so I don’t remember too much. But I feel like it must be tough for you to get to our age thinking the world is a certain way and then find out it’s not at all like that.”
“I understand how you could say that, from what you’ve had to go through,” he said. “But we’ve all had our own ‘civil war’ to deal with. Mine was The Slide. Even though I was a baby, my parents never got over that. All through my childhood, I was painfully aware that something had gone terribly wrong, that my parents could do nothing about it. As I grew up, I saw the old vids of the food riots, the mobs breaking into stores, the tanks guarding the banks. And every year on the anniversary, the memorials, the fat, pious words from politicians and corpos. My parents angrily muttering at the vid screen, always feeling betrayed.”
“Trust me, that’s bad, but it’s nothing like being a slave in a camp run by genocidal maniacs.”
“I didn’t say it was.”
“Felt that way to me. I don’t need to feel you’ve been through what I’ve been through to love you, honestly.”
 “Look, I’m not trying to denigrate your experience. I was agreeing with you about finding out the world is not the way you thought it was. I’ve never lived in a world as bad as the one you escaped. But I have lived in a world that was bad enough to shatter whatever expectations my parents had, that I do know. And I see it on the faces of everyone here. They have ‘The Look’ — I can feel them staring off into a future that terrifies them.”
“OK, I think I can see that. And you’re right about the look. And the blankness — the feeling that you can’t show what you are feeling, that if we all did that, we’d collapse en masse.”
“Authentic, that’s it. And just like I’ve been carrying around The Slide as if it vaccinated me from anything worse, you carry around Efricar. And now we all have to consider that no matter what happened in the past, we’re not prepared for what’s to come.”
She nodded wordlessly, burrowing into his arms more deeply.
We’ve reached the end of words, he thought. They won’t help any more. We need to feel something new, to do something new. He listened to the distant waters, now singing a calming song. Maybe in time he could draw strength from other people’s feelings, just as he drew strength from Lina. She had drifted off to sleep. He let himself drift off, no longer afraid she’d be gone in the morning.

            <Text>Not just a game
March 22, 2049
First thing Monday, Raefe marched into Roshi’s office. He needed time and he needed money to get to Kenya. Once Diver had connected him with Lina, they had sent their thoughts back and forth every time they were able to for the last three days. She was OK, but he couldn’t let her go through this alone. And she thought that there was enormous potential in Dabaab for them to do something. So he needed to get there.
“I never mentioned this, but I have a girl friend, and she’s in some trouble. I need to visit her, soon. And for awhile.”
“Just like that, you are leaving us?” Roshi looked up. “If I wanted staff who were going to do as they please and up and leave, I would get undergrads. And not have to pay them.”
“No, that’s just it,” he said. “I want to work more. I want to know if you can give me more hours, and more money.”
“In my youth, young men talked like that either because they were getting married or getting their girlfriends an abortion.”
“No, it’s nothing like that. She’s in Kenya — that’s where she’s from. She was working out in the boonies and Shabab raided, and she had to flee. Her parents can’t help — it’s complicated — but she needs my help.”
“How much time are you talking about?”
“Maybe a month? But not until I earn enough to get there and back.”
“How much do you need?”
“Maybe 10k?”
“Talk to Elise. She’s stuck. See what she needs. If you can work out a plan where you build them the next phase, you can go off while they do their part and be back in time for when they’ll need you again. I have no money, but I’ll borrow from the end of the project. Timewise, it’ll be the same span as MiniWorlds expected. They don’t have to know what happened between start and finish.” 
“Roshi, thank you so much. I’ll work it out with Elise.”
He ran down the hall to the lab. Elise and Jim were heads down. He told himself to be calm, this was all going to work out.
“Hey, you got a minute?” he asked Elise quietly. No need to bring Jim into the picture yet.
“Sure, what’s up?”
“Can we talk in your office?”
She gave him a puzzled look but got up and they walked over to her office, just big enough for a desk and two chairs. He closed the door.
“Sorry for the drama,” he said, “but I have a favor to ask you. I talked to Roshi and she said I should talk to you.”
“What’s up?” she asked.
He told her what he had told Roshi. 
“So you want to know if there’s some big next thing you can burn the midnight oil to do for the next month, and then take off for a month? Have it got that right.”
“Exactly.”
“I wish there was. I’m sure Roshi told you we’ve discovered very little so far.”
“Stuck was the word she used.”
“Fair description.”
“Maybe I can help. What are you actually trying to learn?” Raefe asked Elise. He could feel her resistance to answering, but couldn’t tell why.
“Listen, if I tell you that, you may tilt the code to help me. It’s only natural.”
“You forget, this is my job. You have a lot on the line — you’re trying to attach you’re name to a certain idea. I’m just doing a job. And I can’t create the right code if I don’t know what the goal is. For me, what you say is just a spec. Soon, I’ll be back doing games for idiots, so don’t worry.”
“You don’t really believe that,” she said, grabbing his forearm. “You have so much talent.”
Ah, now he understood. She wouldn’t just be telling him a spec, but bringing him deeper into her world. For her, this was intimate and therefore complicated. He’d have to think about how to navigate this. Seeing what people felt did not always help him understand how to respond, he was learning that more and more.
“Thanks, coming from you that means something. Listen, do you want to grab a cup of coffee? We can talk this thing through in a more relaxed way.” He thought she needed to get out of the pressure cooker of the lab if she was going to consider something new.
“Sure,” she said, just the hint of a blush in her cheeks. “Can you give me 15 minutes?”
“Do you know where Izzy’s is? Why don’t I meet you there?”
“Down Windsor Street?”
“That’s it.”
*****
“I’ve never been here,” she confessed.
“What?” Raefe was incredulous. “You’ve been at the Toot for six months and never had the best coffee within half a mile? Never mind the empenadas.”
“In Brazil, you must not be so casual about going to sketchy places.”
“Why do you think it’s sketchy here?”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend,” she said, clearly uncomfortable. “Poverty is everywhere in my country, and you have to develop a sense of what is dangerous. Look at that housing complex across the street — it looks like one of those Gangsta vids from my grandpa’s day. People watch those vids in Brazil.”
“Here too,” he said. “Fifty years ago, it was what they used to call a housing project. Mostly people from the Caribbean. It had some drugs and violence, but even then, it wasn’t so bad. But that’s how Izzy’s got started — this was just  the food the people across the street were used to eating. Now it’s all perfectly harmless young people of all sorts. Small, cheap apartments for kids out of college slogging it out in entry level jobs. So they added Mochacinos and Cubanos to the Bustelo for coffee choices, and they have low-carbon salads. Solar greenhouses and all that.”
“Those are all college graduates living there?” she said, somewhat startled.
“That was me my first year at MiniWorlds,” he said. He felt her try to absorb the implications of that. He could sense her immediate and instinctive response was that she was somehow now associated with the underside of society, that she was in the wrong place. And then she scolded herself, both for allowing that which had been hammered into her to surface and for fearing him and people like him. 
“I think maybe you don’t have such a clear picture of life here,” he said, trying to put her at ease. “The Toot is something of a bubble — most of the Americans and all of the foreign students come from pretty elite backgrounds. Most of them would share your preconceptions.”
“But not you?” she asked, her thoughts saying she wanted to unlearn her prejudice.
“I went to UMass, the college run by the state. It’s a good school, but it’s for the foot soldiers — when you get out, you go into teaching, or city government. Or coding, or managing a small biomanufacturing team, or triage officer at a clinic. You’re not likely to become a banker or a high level manager. Hell, you probably won’t even be a software architect, a bio research team leader, or something like that unless you get a bit lucky or are just surprisingly brilliant.”
“But you are so smart,” she said.
“Thanks,” he smiled. “Got it from my dad. My father was one of the last of the old-time coders. He could actually write thousands of lines of code, create whole applications. Back then, they had huge libraries of functions and components. He knew half a dozen different ones like the back of his hand. He worked on the big power grid renewal projects, after the Slide exposed how weak the old grid was. He spent about 10 years working on and off doing that. It was good when the money was coming in, bad when it wasn’t. By the time I was in middle school, when he was done, the first tech like CodeEngine was coming out. He knew nothing of that. He couldn’t get a job for two years.”
“What did you do?”
“Well, my mom was still teaching, so we had a little money coming in. I had a bunk bed from when my older brother was younger, and we rented the top bunk out to various people, which helped a bit. But eventually we had to move to a smaller apartment. And then we had to go on Min.”
“Min?”
“Minimum Standard Living Allowance. Basically, the government pays you to eat and sleep if you can avoid breaking the law.  And then my Dad  taught himself how to install solar panels and moved off to Oregon, so we got off that. I’d already been accepted at UMass so I stayed behind.”
She stared off to the side, taking it all in. He could feel her wrestling with this new information, trying to put it into some context that made sense to her.
“I have not lived in a bubble as much as you think I have. Maybe someday I will explain that. But clearly, more than I thought.”
“No worries.”
“No, it is a worry. Lies, so many lies. In science, we know everything we believe is both right and not fully right, and we are always looking for something more true. And sometimes, we foolishly think the whole world works that way. And then someone has to slap us and show us the lies in front of us. Anyway, thank you for telling me that.”
He could feel a mountain of sadness and anger in her, something in her past. In her homeland.
“I just wanted you to understand that you don’t have to worry about me getting too involved,” he said. “I don’t want to — I know I’m a guest. It’s a great project, I really enjoy it. But I know it will end, and I’ve always known that. But this is the most meaningful work I’ve done yet and I want to contribute. If you don’t tell me what this is really about, I can’t.”
“Well, it’s what Roshi explained — that we’re trying to recreate the evolution of society through simulations so that we can understand what the most important variables are.”
“But nothing we’ve tried has worked. Not even close.”
“Not your fault,” she said. “I don’t think Joe and I have given you all the guidance you’d need.”
“Well, let’s brainstorm. You want me to code vectors for collaboration, competition, hierarchy, equality, and along various dimensions. National, sexual, and so on. What if all of those things interacted with each other?”
“But don’t we already account for that?” Elise said. “When the economy is going full blast, we weight things one way. When it’s middling another, very poorly, different again.”
“What if there were another force at work, that more fundamentally changed our collaborative behavior, for example?” Raefe said. “What if this force made us more collaborative regardless of the economy or wars or other factors you built in? What if, in fact, another force actually overcame the forces that drive wars or economic inequality? Or if its absence drove them?”
“What are you getting at?”she asked.
“Empathy,” said Raefe.
“Empathy?” said Elise, skeptical. “Why would that be different than any other interpersonal emotion — love, hate, greed — and so on?”
“Because empathy is more basic than that,” Raefe said. “Empathy is hardwired into not just people, but all mammals. And many birds. And who knows what other animals. You look at it as a consequence. It’s actually a complex attribute.”
“Of what?” Elise asked.
“Of being able to understand what your fellow creatures are thinking by watching what they’re doing. Your brain says “Oh, she’s waving. When I wave it means I’m glad to see you. So she must be glad to see me.” And all this happens way below the conscious level, fed by sight, sound, smell, gestures — a whole host of signs we’re only partially aware of. Animals evolved to collaborate within their own species without the elaborate thought processes and communications abilities we have. They have an innate ability to get past the immediate competition for food and mates to remain a pack or herd that travels together, protects their young, distributes their food, and polices their members, up to a point.”
“Holy shit, you’re right,” Elise said. “You’ve just defined civilization, except it’s with animals. We were so focused on technology and resources that we missed that. But given all the horrors that happen in the world — where is empathy then?”
“Exactly, that’s the question,” Raefe said. “How do empathy and self-interest get reconciled in our brains, and then how does that translate to social and societal behavior? Why does it all go so wrong sometimes, and other times, so right?”
“Computational empathy,” she said. “There’s some groundbreaking shit. If only we had any idea of where to start.”
“That’s the thing,” Raefe said. “I think I do.”
“Really? That’s cool. But what if we’re just poking at another surface variable,” Elise said. “What if empathy is itself just a reflection of something deeper?”
Like entangement, Raefe smiled to himself. No flies on you.“Then the sim will show us that. But I’d like to try.”
“That’s great, really exciting. But listen, you don’t have the full picture. Do you know who is funding our work?” she asked.
“No, actually. I never thought about it. I just thought, well, the Toot does stuff like this.”
“Yes, they do,” she smiled. “But most of the research here has some kind of corporate or government funding to it. We are not doing science for science sake, as an old phrase went. We are doing science for someone’s sake. In this case, it’s the Reagan Institute.”
“Never heard of them. What’s their deal?”
“Their deal is to keep free market capitalism alive.”
“I thought it was already dead,” he said. “Didn’t we move on after the Slide to social capitalism? We have the Min, and Basic Home, Health and Education and Workforce Entry.”
“And yet here we are, sitting across from a former slum where now highly educated youth struggle to pay the rent, as you have now informed me. One of the advantages of being in the bubble, as you call it, is that people find it necessary to speak a little more openly to their fellow bubble residents. What do you think governs just how Min and Basic social capitalism is for those who depend on it?”
“Ah, I see where you’re heading,” Raefe said. “The elite do. They’re not giving it all up just because some person got elected president by promising a new day.”
“And the elite fund things like the Reagan Institute which tries to scope out policies that will keep the poor from revolting while still allowing the elite to retain and grow their wealth.”
“And why do they care about the evolution of civilization?”
“Actually, they could give a flying fuck about the evolution of civilization,” she said, with more bitterness than he had expected. “This project has a hidden agenda — what is the minimum level of resources that the minimum number of people will require from, as they see it, the wealthy, or more accurately, the worthy, in order to keep society from collapsing? At the end of the day, all the wealthy conceded from the Slide was that they had to give some ground. Like the man who finds out that he can still rape women, but must be satisfied  with only one or two victims a month. And not expecting them to smile.”
“And then announces that the threat of mass rape has ended,” he said, wondering if she was speaking from personal experience.
“Yes, my smart friend, exactly. So what we have been doing is seeing what happens if you cut calories by 20%, or reduce family allowances to tilt toward just 1child, and so on. Roshi actually believed that we could learn about human society this way. But Roshi is not a computational person. She came from the qual side and doesn’t see why this won’t work.”
“I guess I don’t understand either.”
“I’ll try and explain. Think about astronomy in the Renaissance. You started, in 1300, with Europeans believing that Sun revolved around the Earth.”
“And then Copernicus disproved that and showed the Earth revolved around the Sun.”
“Well, not exactly. What Copernicus actually did was to take ancient Greek ideas about the planets moving in perfect circles and make the Earth move in a perfect circle around the Sun, inside a perfect sphere. He wasn’t so sure about the other planets, though, and he and the rest of the scientific community — they called themselves natural philosophers back then — played with all of these variants. What if the outer planets moved around the Earth, or inside other polygons, and so on. The point is, their model of planetary motion was missing the most essential element: what makes the planets move at all, and in the way they do?”
“Right, gravity. Newton figured that out.”
“Mostly, yes, and almost 300 years after Copernicus.  And then Einstein made it true on the scale of the universe. In the meantime, none of their existing astronomical models — simulations, if you will — explained the known past, the present, or the near future of the planets. Things you could see with your own eyes — the coming of spring, a lunar eclipse, the rising and setting of Mars — these could not be accurately accounted for in their sims. Nonetheless, they kept tinkering — adding a little here and a little there. Until Newton saw that it was all governed by underlying, universal forces.”
“And that’s what we’re missing?”
“Your simulation code, at our direction, is basically a long equation that that’s something like ax + by + cz, with many more variables. When our subjects play it, we see what happens when we make “a” bigger, or “c” negative. But the relationships between x and y and z stay the same. If society really worked that way, we would have proved it already. But it doesn’t. Because we’re asking the wrong questions. Actually, we’re being paid to ask the wrong questions, because those are the questions our sponsors want answered.”
“And you want to know what’s the gravity of social evolution?”
“Yes! Exactly. We want to give Reagan some answers, but their whole question is flawed. So we’ll hack something out of the data and it will be years before they realize it’s meaningless. But Jim and I desperately want to advance the question in a big way.”
“So how do we do that?”
This time her smile was actually happy. “I thought you’d never ask,” she said. “We need you to hide certain dynamics in the code, and then show us how to run the game so that we can satisfy the grant, but also do what we want. And Roshi can’t know, much less the RI guys.”
“You understand that every game I build is just a projection of dynamics on to a set of contraints?”
“Maybe. What do you mean by that?”
“Every day at my usual job I take a game engine that takes input, puts it through some algorithms, and then feeds it to game rules, which then feed it back to a visualization engine. And I hook it up to different customers’ game rules and visualization engines.”
“You’re saying that the input, the data normalization algorithms, the game rules and the visualization are all separable?” she asked.
“Now who’s the smart kid? They are already separated. There’s no reason why I can’t  feed the normalized data through two sets of rules — yours and theirs. We can store your game rule output and then you and Jim can run the vids after hours and see what you can see.”
“That’s fantastic.”
“You should have asked me sooner.”
“Yes, I can see that now.” 
They agreed he would spend the next month working day and night to build the second set of rules and the plumbing to run two sims off of one data set and deliver two outputs. One would be for Reagan, one for Elise and Jim. Elise assured him she’d handle Roshi and smooth it out. Once he had completed the code, they’d do a short QA cycle. Then he could go off while they had people come in and play the games. Some would see the Reagan output, some would see the real output, but they’d get usable data from both. When he got back, they would move on to the final phase of fine tuning the game based on what they’d learned from the new rules.
Later, he found Lina. It was late there, but she had been waiting for him. She hadn’t expected that he would be able to pull this off so soon, but she was more than excited to hear that he would be there soon. And she wanted to know more about this sim; it meshed with things she had observed in Dabaab. 
“Funny how this is working out,” Raefe said. “We were two kids scruffling to find a place, and then we were driftwood washed up on an island. And now we’re head-skyping about shit that’s all cutting edge. And we’re on that edge.”
“You’re going to be amazed when you get here,” Lina said. “It’s like visiting the future.”
“As long as we don’t have to visit the past.”</Text>

            <Text>Into the fold
Traveller’s Perch
October 23, 2048

Green fidgeted with his tea, remembering that Soars above the Plains of Hanikori was always late. After Diver’s visit, he had told Hanikori that she had come to visit. Kori insisted they should meet. Too important to let this float in the waveform, he had said. So here Green was, looking out over the Red Canyons, sipping bitter tea.
Hanikori appeared around the corner. Strange that he had not sensed him before that, Green thought. Kori seemed to glide into his chair, just as a waiter appeared with a glass of water.
“Ah, my young friend,” Hanikori said, “so good of you to come.”
“You asked me to keep an eye on Diver,” he said. “I thought you’d be interested to hear what she was interested in.” He told Kori about the alternate timelines, leaving out the conversation about Kori’s tenure as ambassador to Earth.
“Her boy must be failing,” Hanikori said, with no small glee. “She wants to know if she can keep him going on some better Earth.”
“Yes, I suspect so. I told her about the history of the project.”
“You did what? Why?”
“Well, she was bound to find out. But I also gave her the impression that she only got the assignment because of her tie to Far Flier. I don’t think she’s going to want to get too insistent now. She’ll only embarrass herself.”
“True. Thanks for letting me know.” Hanikori went still, staring at nothing in particular. Green could feel nothing from his mind, which was weird.
“Kori, are you OK?”
Hanikori smiled. “All my friends have called me that only once. Please don’t. Our society seems hell-bent to break down every last barrier between individuals. I prefer to keep some boundaries, and would appreciate you respect my name. For me, the history of my ancestors is a source of great pride.”
“Sure,” Green said, embarassed. He’d heard this about Kori, but was still surprised that it was true. Everyone had a past, so what? “As you wish.”
“Thank you. But let’s not worry about that. I think this incident with Diver is a good moment to talk about the future, not the past.”
“Okay, then, what about the future?” Green asked.
Hanikori went away again, just for a second. How does he do that, Green wondered. And why? It’s annoying. 
“Green, my young colleague,” Hanikori said. “When you think of our society, what do you think holds it up?”
“Hmmm. I’d never really thought of that,” Green said. “I mean, I can see that we exist in a web of cultures, from our own here on Traveller’s Perch to the other Guardian worlds. Bits and pieces of this and that.”
“Yes, true,” Hanikor said. “But entirely beside the point. Our world is built on three things: entanglement, the wormhole interface and enhancement.”
“OK, I see how you get to that.” He was disappointed that timeline technology was not included in Hanikori’s view.
“We have had those things for thousands of years, and yet they remain the pillars of our existence. Do you ever wonder why?”
“Well, because they work,” Green said, puzzled by the question. “For 10,000 years, we have had no wars, no famines. We live longer and better.”
“What if I told you that we could live forever?”
“I’d ask you why and how.” Green felt a small ball of concern rise deep in his mind. His eyes scanned the plaza automatically, checking for danger. His enhancements dismissed the fear reflex and he felt a tiny squirt of hormones that would calm him.
“Why? Why not? When I was younger, my mother and father passed. They had not merely given birth to me, in the way of the ancients, and left me to my own. Our minds had intermingled, our thoughts and feelings shared at the deepest level. And yet, they were gone. Later, my own child was killed in an accident — yes, it still happens. And my mates will leave the world, and not so long from now. Why endure all of this suffering?”
“I don’t know,” Green said. “I was taught, like everyone else, that there is no alternative. There is no life without death.”
“And who are these gods,” Hanikori laughed, “who know how much or how little we may accomplish throughout eternity?”
OK, interesting question, thought Green. Kori might seem a little off, but never dull.
“What is it you have in mind?” he asked.
Hanikori smiled. “In due time. But for now, let’s talk about the Guardians. Our mission has always been to preserve intelligent life, which seems to be about 20 species in our galaxy.”
“So far.”
“Well, if there are more, they’re doing a great job of hiding.”
This was the great debate among the Guardian species. Was this it for the Milky Way? No matter which timelines Green had explored, the number never seemed to change much.
“OK, granted, although I feel like there are still vast swaths of the far Milky Way that are a stranger to us. But what do you make of this paucity of intelligent life?”
“That our original mission has to change. That our approach to preservation of intelligent life has stagnated. Tell me, what would we do if some superior species from another galaxy, with technologies that we haven’t even dreamed of, attacked us?”
“We’ve always believed that wouldn’t happen. If they had survived long enough to become that developed, it could not have been on the basis of aggression.”
“Or perhaps we just don’t have the imagination to understand how they could develop that way. Are you willing to bet our future on that, forever?”
Green was troubled by this line of argument. Could Hanikori be on to something? Why not find out?
“No, I suppose not. What are the alternatives?”
“Now you are asking the right question. The only question the Guardians should be asking and the one question that we so far have refused to even look for the answer to. And you, young Green, can help us find that answer.”

            <Text>Ambush
May 18, 2049
Hanikori felt the breeze coming up from the canyons, bringing a cool moistness to the plaza. Not many people were around. He had read that this plaza was once part of the last great city on Traveller’s Perch. When the people of the world had become entangled 10,000 years ago, they found the psychic noise of millions of people packed together intolerable. And unnecessary — with their various and fierce internecine conflicts on the wane, the power of concentrated cities gave way to the sustainability of distributed ones. They had spread out, like bright paint on a wet canvas, the drops melding and overlapping to form loose neighborhoods.
Pity, he thought. This moment deserves some drama. What it must have felt like for Cresilion, the last emperor of Traveller’s Perch, to stand atop the ledges, his amplified voice addressing a million people below. Their sweat, their breath, their heat all welling up toward him. And his power reaching down, touching them all. But Cresilion had led the retreat, hadn’t he, from the high civilization of Traveller’s Perch into the Guardian ethos. Well, what choice did he have? The endless wars, the desolation of the water and food — Cresilion had done what had to be done. Yet, something had been lost, hadn’t it?
And now something more would be gained, but all in due time. He sensed Far Flier’s approach even before his network bots informed him that the train carrying the Guardian Council chief was pulling into the nearby station. A minute later, Far Flier was across the plaza, giving a curt wave, his mind closed to Hanikori. Well, he’s no fool, is he, Hanikori thought. I’d do the same.
Hanikori offered him a seat and some alefka to drink. 
“Thanks,” Far Flier said to the offer. “Nice to have a little boost in the late afternoon.”
“Agreed,” Hanikori said. “We’re not middle-aged anymore.” He half-expected Far Flier to correct him, but that would mean acknowledging that Hanikori was, in fact, quite middle-aged while Far Flier was past the halfway point of his life. But he would make that point later, in a more decisive manner. He let Far Flier savor the bittersweet taste of his boiled berries, their mild stimulant properties adding to what his enhancements provided, while they exchanged pleasantries. Still, he could not read the old man’s mood.
“What’s on your mind, Hanikori,” he asked. “I can’t remember the last time we met like this.”
“I thought a frank exchange of views was in order,” Hanikori said. “There’s a lot going on in the Guardian Council these days, and as the two most senior members, I thought we should chat on our own.”
“You’re worried I’ll get in the way of your new lightspeed ship project?”
“Oh, no,” Hanikori said. “That’s well underway. It hasn’t escaped my attention that you’re quite interested in it, though. You think I’ve got something up my sleeve, though, don’t you?”
“No, I know you have something up your sleeve,” Far Flier said, smiling as if he were complimenting him. “And I know it’s something outside of our mission.”
“You see, this was such a good idea. Because it’s our mission that I wanted to talk with you about,” Hanikori said, returning the smile. “I’ve always thought of you as someone who sees our mission as that of a watcher and a waiter. And yet I see now that I’m wrong. You, like me, are much more of an activist.”
“You think so?”
“Oh yes,” he said, enjoying himself immensely. “I see now how wrong I’ve been. It hit me like a hot wind rising from a deep canyon at our last council meeting. Everyone was so interested in Diver and Raefe, but what caught my attention was the girl.”
He paused, but Far Flier didn’t respond.
“You see,” he continued, “I almost missed it, but then it struck me: how did you re-locate her to a new timeline? Raefe, sure, Diver had established a connection with him. I may think he’s a dead end on a dead end planet, but he is a natural entangler. She — is Lina her name? — on the other hand, had shown no such talents before.”
“It’s true,” Far Flier said. “But this was an unusual circumstance. She was with Raefe, who she has a very deep and intuitive tie with. And they were under a lot of stress. Really, about to die — it doesn’t get any more stressful than that. And we’ve seen stress trigger the conversion to being an entangler before. Isn’t that the story of Na’wra? Granted we don’t see it often, but not never.”
He really doesn’t know, Hanikori though. This is just delicious.
“We both know that wasn’t what happened. I’m going to save you the embarrassment of continuing this lie.” He let Far Flier see the data that Green had relayed to him of Lina’s conversion. The data stream showed clearly that Far Flier had orchestrated the whole thing. “You see, I have important and useful friends, too. Even if I don’t spend my evenings with them.”
Far Flier still had not betrayed any emotion. Ever the leader, Hanikori thought, weighing your next move even when you don’t actually have one.
“I can see why you would say that,” Far Flier said slowly. “But I prefer my version. Anyway, you’ve never been much a stickler for the rules before. I seem to remember certain leaders of one Earth country — North Korea was it? — who became quite bizarre around the time you were ambassador to Earth. I’ve always wondered about that — had it in the back of my mind to look into that. Hopefully, your important and useful friends haven’t cleansed the record.”
“My, my,” Hanikori said. “I seem to have struck a nerve.”
“No, I wouldn’t say that. I just find your penchant for theater tiresome. What is it you want?”
“I want the Guardians to benefit Traveller’s Perch. And all the other members, for that matter. I want the Guardians to stop wasting time and resources on doomed civilizations like Earth.”
“Ah, so you can now see both the past and the future, is that it?”
“Sarcasm is my vice, Far Flier. It fits you poorly. And yes, I can see a bit of the future. I can see that your term as leader of the Guardian Council is coming to an end.”
“You want me to step down?”
“I do. I have no need to discredit you. You can make up whatever story you want. You can take some time to do it. But within the year, you’ll step down. And you won’t involve yourself in the discussion of your successor.”
“I never thought you had the patience to lead the Council.”
“And now I don’t have the patience not to. But I don’t care about the formality — I can work with others.”
Far Flier stood up, his face still blank. “The future, you will find out, is an uncooperative beast.”
It’s done, Hanikori thought. He’s done. Cresilion would have approved.

            <Synopsis>Lina entangles with Fatima</Synopsis>
            <Text>Meeting of the Minds
May 21, 2049
Living in Dadaab felt nothing like Cambridge to Raefe. In Cambridge, he was surrounded by a dense fog from which he could sense just the dimmest light of people’s thoughts and feelings. Here the fog was a thin mist and the dim light was replaced by soft whispers, each person distinct and sometimes comprehensible.
“I feel like it wouldn’t take much to connect with most of these people,” Raefe said.
“Some of them, like Edna, are so close to being able to entangle,” Lina replied. “They finish each other’s sentences so often it’s more like someone started the other person’s thought.”
“I asked Diver if she could nudge them over the line,” he said, “but she won’t. She says they made an exception with you and then by connecting us, but we must find our own way. Otherwise, it could turn out badly. But I don’t know how to do that.”
And then he felt hungry, yet happy that it was a cool day. But they weren’t his feelings.
“What was that?” he asked.
“That was Edna’s daughter, Fatima.”
“You can feel her mind that way?”
“Yes, I have been around her for many weeks and know her mind well. But we have grown closer, too. I wanted to see if I could do that, connect your mind to hers through mine. And it worked?”
“That wasn’t just me feeling your idea of her? That was her?”
“Yes, she is a very intuitive person, like her mother. So it was easier with her.”
“But she can’t feel your thoughts?”
“Not yet,” she smiled. “But I have an idea.”
Later, she bumped into Edna.
“You will come to my daughter’s ceremony this afternoon, after Friday prayers?” Edna asked.
“I won’t be at prayers, but yes, for Fatima I will be there,” Lina replied.
“This is your first time, for such a ceremony?”
“Yes. Is there anything I need to know?”
“No, just look for the hut with the red banners near the dining hall at the far end of the camp. Everything will  explain itself. Here, we have so many different traditions we do not worry too much about doing things just so. It is enough to do them at all. I will be with the mothers, and we will sing. Fatima will drink a special tea we will make her, so that she can hear the truth of what we sing. And then we will dress her and she will return to her family and friends a woman.”
And able to entangle, thought Lina. She felt Raefe in her mind, excited by her plan.
“You realize how big this is,” he said. “To see if we can create a whole new kind of human relationship?”
“I’m trying just to think about it like a new kind puter message,” she said. “One that doesn’t need a puter.”
When the time came, Lina had trouble calming herself. Making small talk with the other women was excruciating.Then the ceremonial tea was served, and Lina found herself slowly being more drawn into the group.
She  had thought through carefully what was about to happen. She would concentrate on Fatima, reaching out, gently touching her mind. Raefe would be in the nearby dining hall, pretending to read a book but actually monitoring what he could of the other women. Since Truro Island, they’d not been able to move their new world off of the same path as their old one. Now, maybe, they could take a first step in creating the kind of world the Guardians seemed to live in.
Edna and a few of her long-time friends began the ceremony. Edna spoke in Swahili, but some of the songs she and the other women sang were in other languages she didn’t understand. Some also sounded like Arabic prayers. Finally, Fatima was brought into the middle of the tent, all the other women around her in a circle. She wore her normal clothes, except for a new red headscarf.
Edna said more words in a language Lina didn’t know. Then Fatima began to sing those words and more in the same language. The song was long, and Fatima fell into its rhythms, her voice now speaking from somewhere inside her.
Lina found Fatima’s mind easily. Lina heard the thoughts in the song, of creation, of every woman’s part in the creation of the world, and of the worlds to come. Lina could feel Fatima’s joy. When Fatima was done, she sat quietly, a huge grin on her face. Another woman began a song, this one a bit racey, about a woman and a man. Certain lines brought laughter from some of the women. No need to translate, Lina thought.
Lina calmed herself and focused on Fatima’s mind. “I am happy for you,” she thought, repeating the thought as in a chant. After a minute or so, she felt Fatima register her presence in her thoughts. The girl was a bit alarmed.
“Why does it seem like Lina is in my mind,” Fatima asked herself.
“Because we are in each other’s minds,” Lina answered.
“Oh, my mother never said anything about this. Is this part of being a woman? Sometimes it feels like the aunties are in each other’s minds,” Fatima thought.
“No, this is just you and me,” Lina said. “We have made a strong connection since I came. I could feel your thoughts easily.”
“Can you read other people’s minds?” Fatima thought. “Can they read yours?”
“Yes, I can read a few other people’s minds, and they mine. I believe we can all do this eventually. You seemed open to it, so I thought I’d try. I think the tea helped.”
“What if I don’t want to share my thoughts with you?” Fatima asked.
“Can you feel this part of your mind?” Lina asked, touching a certain part of her thoughts lightly.
“Yes.”
“Focus on that and make that the center of your thoughts.” She felt Fatima’s thoughts gradually fade way. She made eye contact with her and made a “OK?” face. She felt Fatima come back to her mind.
“We will talk more later, Fatima,” Lina said. “For now, I just wanted to say congratulations.” She felt Fatima’s “thanks.”
The ceremony went on some, but Lina felt drained. She stayed long enough to eat some of the little cakes on offer, and then wandered out of the tent. She felt Raefe reaching out to her.
“I think that went OK,” Lina said.
“You were able to entangle with her?” Raefe said.
“Yes, and she with me. I showed her how to block her thoughts, too. And then she initiated contact again. But it was exhausting.”
“For my part, I could feel other minds sort of paying attention, but no more. I think they felt a disturbance, like a  breeze, but nothing too upsetting.”
“Good.”
She walked to the edge of the camp, wanting to be alone and regroup. She sat on the ground, a tree between her back and the camp. Some large birds were perched on a tree in the distance, their occasional squawks managing to sound both languid and menacing. She could see they were taking turns feeding on a dead animal below them. The warm breezes felt good and soon she felt herself slipping into a dreamless sleep. She awoke suddenly, as if her mind had sensed danger. It was almost dark now and the light was falling like a soft dark curtain. She realized someone was standing in front of her. Lina made herself very still and quiet.
“Who are you?” the stranger asked. It was Edna’s voice.
“What do you mean? You know who I am.”
“Millima Kawambai-Yang, now Lina. But who are you really? Are you a witch?”
“Why would you say that?”
“In the tent, you touched my daughter’s mind.”
“She told you this?”
“No, she knows nothing of this. I felt it.”
“You can feel other people’s minds?” Lina asked.
“Yes, a little. Not like a witch, but a little.”
“I’m not a witch. I’m just Lina. I can feel other people’s thoughts, and sometimes they can feel mine. I think all of you can almost do it. Your troubles have brought you together. And your ideas have made you open to each other.”
“Why did you touch Fatima’s mind?”
“I feel her thoughts all of the time — she is like a radio broadcasting. I wanted her to feel mine. To talk and feel each other’s thoughts better.”
“Can you feel mine?”
“Yes, sometimes.”
“And doing what you do — it’s not dangerous to her? Or to you?”
“No, it’s not that different than when you feel a deep connection with someone. Only now, it’s in words and it’s alive — you’re trading your thoughts and feelings in a deeper way than talking.”
“Teach me to do this.”
“Why?”
“Because if we could all do this, we could heal our wounds and be stronger. We could learn trust. And who not to trust.”
“I’m so glad you said that, because that was my purpose. I have never done this before. Fatima was just the person who it seemed easiest with. I wanted to wait and see what happened. I can’t teach everyone, and certainly not at once. Will you trust me to wait?”
“She is my daughter. I want to protect her if she needs it. If you teach me now, I won’t say anything until you want me to.”
“I will need help — our connection is not yet strong. I might need Raefe to help.”
“He can do this, too?”
“Yes, he showed me how. He is very strong this way. Will you come to our tent around 10? We can see what we can do.”
“I will come with Fatima. I don’t want her to feel alone in this.”
“OK. Edna — I want you to know I would never hurt Fatima. Everything we do, Raefe and I, we have been hurt, too. We want to find a new way to heal. We want to prevent all of this, and worse, from happening to the whole world.” She point with her head toward the camp.
“If you are telling the truth, I will help you. But for now, you should be careful who you say what to. Some people will be afraid of you.”

            <Text>Changing the rules
July 12, 2049
Raefe sat in the back of the small auditorium, watching images flow into and out of the big vid screen upfront as if it were some new installation from Maru Imani Baraka, the Afro-Japanese artist who was all the rage among people who enjoyed watching semi-autonomous colorful blobs dance with each other willy nilly. This was, after all, pure theater for the Reagan Institute people.
His reworked code had allowed the team to fulfill their grant. Enough quantum storage cubes to build a small house with were full of the data his code had generated would keep the RI people busy for years. For the few millions they had spent at the Toot, they would be able to propose wringing billions of dollars of social benefits out of the system with a more informed hope that it wouldn’t spark riots or unintentionally bring the wheels of commerce to a grinding halt. Meanwhile, everyone oohed and aahed as the Civilization Project slides traced their incomplete history of humanity. “Wait until version 2!” was the mantra. All it lacked was a catchy theme song.
When it was done, the RIers went off amid prodigious mutual backslapping to celebrate the completion of the project. Roshi stayed behind.
“When you’re done cleaning up,” she said, “come see me. We have some things to discuss.”
Ah, the work is done and now I’m going to be packed off back to MiniWorlds,” he thought. Not that he hadn’t expected it, just not so soon. He got the room in reasonable shape. No use killing himself on it if he was going to be gone any way. He walked down the hall to Roshi’s office thinking he would miss this place.
Roshi feigned busyness as he walked in, as if she had something on her puter to finish first. He had learned to recognize her little power games over the months. Harmless amusement.
“Well, that went well,” she said.
“Yes, I’m glad. It was a very interesting project to work on.”
She didn’t respond for an extra beat or two. He suddenly was aware that she was unhappy, or angry.
“I’m sure you understand that with the project coming to an end, you’ll have to wrap up your role here.”
“I sort of figured that out. I mean, Elise and Joe alluded to some future iterations and so on. And it would be fun. Is that not in the cards?”
“Elise and Joe are no longer connected with the Civilization Project,” she said.
“Wow, that’s some news,” he said, buying time as he tried to process what was going on. Her mind had transitioned to a steely resolve, but he still couldn’t understand what lay beneath it. “What happened?”
“Look, I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt here,” she said. “I know all about their alternate sim, with your empathy codes and all that. I’m going to assume that was their doing. I’ve had my doubts about Elise all along — there were some sketchy things in her past in Brazil. But I can’t have team members secretly undermining our grants.”
“What are you saying about what she did?” he asked, trying to sound uninformed and naive.
“Let’s just say that the code she had you write could potentially be used not just to simulate our society, but to simulate how our society could be overthrown. I believe Elise is secretly working for some kind of underground revolutionary group in Brazil.”
“Wow, she never said anything about that.”
“Yes, well, she underestimated both me and the Reagan Institute people. We have our own resources and that’s all I’m going to say about it. But I won’t say anything to MiniWorlds. I don’t think you had anything to do with it, and it wouldn’t be fair to you.”
He could tell she was lying.
“You missed the big show,” Raefe said. “Roshi had them gasping with delight. Like six-year olds watching their first DisneyDream vid.”
“She suggested we wouldn’t really like it that much,” Joe said. “She knows we know the whole thing is a sham.”
“And she wants us to keep going with our version,” Elise said. “RI was a big cash score. Now she wants some academic cred from us.”
“So what did you learn from the new code while I was gone?” Raefe asked.
“We’re not sure,” Elise confessed. “On the one hand, for some stretches of time, the new sim comes tantalizingly close to recreating the main outlines of history.”
“But then, it goes off the rails completely,” Joe added. “Major events in history never show up, major events in the sim never actually happened.”
“I think I know why,” Raefe said.
“Did you find a mistake in the coding?” Elise said, surprised. 
“No, it’s not that,” Raefe said. “It’s what I saw in Africa that made me think about it.” Well, that’s a not entirely true, he thought, but I’m not ready to tell them about entanglement…yet.
“Say more,” said Joe.
“You asked me to code vectors for collaboration, competition, hierarchy, equality, and along various dimensions. National, sexual, and so on. What if all of those things interacted with each other?”
“But don’t we already account for that?” Elise said. “When the economy is going full blast, we weight things one way. When it’s middling another, very poorly, different again.”
“What if there were another force at work, that more fundamentally changed our collaborative behavior, for example?” Raefe said. “What if this force made us more collaborative regardless of the economy or wars or other factors you built in? What if, in fact, another force actually overcame the forces that drive wars or economic inequality? Or if its absence drove them?”
“What are you getting at?” asked Joe.
“Empathy,” said Raefe.
“Empathy?” said Elise, skeptical. “Why would that be different than any other interpersonal emotion — love, hate, greed — and so on?”
“Because empathy is more basic than that,” Raefe said. “Empathy is hardwired into not just people, but all mammals. And many birds. And who knows what other animals. You look at it as a consequence. It’s actually a complex attribute.”
“Of what?” Elise asked.
“Of being able to understand what your fellow creatures are thinking by watching what they’re doing. Your brain says “Oh, she’s waving. When I wave it means I’m glad to see you. So she must be glad to see me.” And all this happens way below the conscious level, fed by sight, sound, smell, gestures — a whole host of signs we’re only partially aware of. Animals evolved to collaborate within their own species without the elaborate thought processes and communications abilities we have. They have an innate ability to get past the immediate competition for food and mates to remain a pack or herd that travels together, protects their young, distributes their food, and polices their members, up to a point.”
“Holy shit, you’re right,” Joe said. “You’ve just defined civilization, except it’s with animals. We were so focused on technology and resources that we missed that.”
“If you had been with me and seen the people who had saved Lina, you couldn’t have missed it.”
“Yet all those people are victims of the worst kind of aggression,” Elise said. “Where was empathy then?”
“Exactly, that’s the question,” Raefe said. “How do empathy and self-interest get reconciled in our brains, and then how does that translate to social and societal behavior? Why does it all go so wrong sometimes, and other times, so right?”
“Computational empathy,” Joe said. “There’s some groundbreaking shit. If only I had any idea of where to start.”
“Try this,” Raefe said, sending Joe’s puter a cloud address. “It’s just a start, but on the plane home I went back into the code and added empathy vectors in. They work both positively and negatively, so you can play with them in both directions. But you’re the math guy. I don’t know how to make them dynamic and I don’t know how to build a network so that they interact with other vectors. But I’m pretty sure that empathy can drive a reduction in competition or inequality, and that a lack of it can drive the reverse.”
“What if we’re just poking at another surface variable,” Elise said. “What if empathy is itself just a reflection of something deeper?”
Like entangement, Raefe smiled to himself. No flies on you.
“Then that will show up in the sim,” he said. “It’s just an idea I had. Are you willing to build it and run it?”
“Hell, yeah,” Joe said. “This is some deep shit.”

            <Synopsis>Raefe meets Goodstuff Benjamin at the camp</Synopsis>
            <Text>Voodo Redux
June 2, 2049

Meal time at Dadaab was always interesting. Some of the men would not eat with unaccompanied women, some of the women agreed. Others deliberately ignored the old traditions. Raefe had noticed that this caused some friction.
“Do you ever talk to that man in green turban?” he asked Lina, pointing to a man sitting by himself rather than near sit with women. 
“He won’t speak to me, since I’m not married,” she said. “Maybe now that you’re here, he will.”
Raefe didn’t want to say his next thoughts out loud. “Can you sense his feelings?”
“No,” she thought. “He is a closed door to me.”
“I wonder if we can change these attitudes.”
“They are changing, but so slowly.”
“I don’t mean by the usual way of arguing and debating. What if he could understand your feelings, my feelings, and see that we are not a threat? That you are here just because you are a person, not a temptation sent by God or devils?”
“I don’t think it will be that simple. For these men, power over the women of their little villages was the only power they ever had.”
“And at what cost?”
“To them? I see where you are going — their ways could never keep them safe and now that’s perfectly obvious. This is really the heart of it, isn’t it?”
“Still,” Raefe said. “What difference will gaining empathic powers make? Maybe I mean, how will it make a difference? What would we do if he would let us connect? What would we want him to do if he could entangle with anyone? It’s frustrating sometimes, to have this ability and not know what to do with it.”
Their thoughts were interrupted by someone standing behind to Lina.
“Do you mind if I sit with you?” the man said, pointing to the empty space on the bench.
“Please, sit down,” Raefe waived. The man looked vaguely familiar, odd considering the circumstances. “I’m Raefe.”
“Ah, you are the American,” the man said. “I was born there.”
“Really? How long did you live there?” Raefe asked.
“Until my early twenties. Then I moved to Nigeria. Allow me to introduce myself — Alton Smith.”
“Raefe Epstein Miller. And this is Lina Kawambai Yang.” He could feel that Lina remembered him, too, from Truro Island. He felt like he was looking at a ghost.
“Pleased to meet you, Lina. I see you are another African Diaspora child. My mother was Nigerian, but she married a Latino man from the Carribean who worked on the oil rigs in Nigeria. They left that hellhole and went to the Dominican Republic.”
“Actually, I’m more part of the Chinese Diaspora,” Lina said. “My father came to Kenya to work and here I am.”
“Oh well, we are a mobile lot, we humans, aren’t we?” Alston chuckled.
“When we’re not fiercely defending some patch of dirt we’ve managed to convince ourselves is better than anywhere else,” Raefe said.
“Indeed,” Alston said.
“Are you new here? I haven’t seen you around,” Lina said.
“I’ve just arrived from Nigeria,” Alston said.
“Are you thinking of becoming a Citizen of Nowhere?” she asked.
“In a way,” he answered. “I’m here to talk about an alliance. I’ve been working with Goodstuff Benjamin in Nigeria. Have you heard of him?”
Raefe couldn’t remember whether he had heard of Goodstuff in this world. “I’m not sure. The name sounds familiar.”
“Maybe New Voodo Army?”
“As in soldiers and guns?” asked Lina. “Not likely Nowhere will want to go that route.”
“We are not soldiers. We are ordinary people. Our biggest weapon is actually our technology, what we call New Voodo. We make power, grow crops, build houses, all in ways that don’t poison us, and don’t make us slaves to the corpos.”
“So why the ‘Army?’” Raefe asked.
“To scare away our enemies, of course,” Alton laughed. “Seriously, we sometimes do have to defend ourselves. Here in East Africa, you face ragtag pirates and former jihadiis who find it easier to pillage than farm. Although in fairness, the drought has taken away much of that option. Unlike Kenya and the other countries in the area, Nigeria has a strong and very corrupt government. They fund many militias to keep the people in line. And when that doesn’t work, the Army pays a visit.”
“So you are at war with them?” Lina asked.
“Not really at war. We just needed to be able to defend ourselves if they raid us. Our people are not nomads — they are villagers. What good is it building a new way of life if you have leave and build it over every two or three years?”
“So what do you want with the Citizens?” Raefe asked.
“We want to get ready for the future. We want to find safety in numbers, for both groups. And we want to learn from each other. Nowhere is basically an idea about identity and governance. New Voodo is about how we use the planet. We are on the same side — can we make something stronger together?”
“Wow, that’s ambitious — I’d love to learn more. Raefe is going back to the U.S. tomorrow, but I’ll be here for awhile. I’m part of Edna’s band. You know her?”
“Not yet. I’ll be meeting with some sort of loose council — maybe she’s on it. I gather this place is not big on heirarchy.”
“No, it’s not,” she said. “Not guns either. But on the other hand, it sounds like NVA is more advanced than us in building new kinds of villages and infrastructure. So yeah, sounds cool.”
Later that night, lying in the forest after making love for their last time in awhile, they listened to the birds, letting their thoughts flow silently.
“I’m going to miss you. Both of me are going to miss you,” Raefe thought. “Actually I think the new me is up to speed on you now,” caressing the curve of her breast.
“Likewise,” she said, returning his caress. “Important things have happened while you were here.”
“Diver will be pleased to know. The time she bought us has been useful. You’ve entangled with more people, you have the start of an entangled village here. We’ve met Alton and we both can build on that. And I’ve got my Civilization Project, which may yet tell us something useful.”
“The awkward little Black Chinese girl and the dreamy underachieving software writer with migraines — no one would guess that we’re changing the world.”
“Trying at least.

            <Synopsis>Diver throws her lot in with Far Flier</Synopsis>
            <Text>Clearing her mind
June 4, 2049
After her swim with Far Flier, Diver had spent several days buried in work. She had wanted to say yes to him on the spot, but mistrusted herself and needed time to think. The conflict with Hanikori was ominous and strange. All the same, she had spent considerable hours monitoring Raefe and Lina a Dadaab, and things there were going better than she had expected.
The Guardians had long debated how conscious entanglement had arisen through evolution. After all, Na’Wra had no one to teach her. Nothing in her culture prepared her for it, or even considered it possible. Many scholars had concluded that the survival pressures of extended war had triggered epigenetic changes in her. These same changes enabled her to make them permanent and to instruct her progeny in how to trigger them and keep them from dissolving. Lina’s experiences at Dadaab lent credence to that theory. The emergence of Fatima and Edna as naive entanglers was living proof that certain kinds of stresses could trigger this evolution. Still, the details were murky.
All very interesting if her job was as a researcher, but she was a Guardian ambassador. Most exciting was the convergence of Raefe and Lina’s abilities with the social awareness of Citizens of Nowhere and the alternate economic system of the New Voodo Army. This was the first time in Earth’s history that the prototypical elements had come together that usually helped civilizations escape the Optimization phase and grow into a more sustainable culture. The Guardian archives were full of such flowerings failing. But of the 20 civilizations now in the Guardians, all but one had followed this sort of path.
She would give Far Flier her answer in a few days, but first, she needed to be sure. It was time for alakh, or thinking sleep. She arranged her room for maximum quiet. She removed herself from all entanglements. Finally she disconnected her enhancements from all communications. She was alone with her thoughts.
She watched the movie of her life as if it were someone else. For more than 100 years, she had been the bright female that everyone liked. She was the person who had energy and promise. But her accomplishments were minor. Despite what Far Flier said, she was sure that she would never lead the Guardian Council as he had. She was not a pathbreaker.
And yet she realized now that she couldn’t know that. She didn’t know what the future would bring, with or without Far Flier, with or without the Guardian Council. She couldn’t pretend that her future lay only in that context. It was time to inventory just what she had done.
She had engaged with Raefe and now in only a year or so, had brought him very far down the road to being a significant change agent. She had helped him through his trials with separation, and now he and Lina were a force to be reckoned with. No one had recruited a new civilization to the Guardians in centuries and now she was close to doing just that.
The point wasn’t that she had accomplished this, but that she had surprised herself with her strength, perseverance and skill. These would be her pillars, no matter what she undertook. And she realized that Far Flier had said these things to her many ways, many times. And now she knew that he was not just acting the teacher, but also the pupil. He needed her.
Not just him. If what he had said was right, the Guardians needed her. Although he was only in his late middle years and not yet old, he had lost some of his hope and strength. Hanikori was cunning and she knew he had allies planted in many places. Far Flier had held Hanikori off, but it was only a matter of time before he retreated to a place from which he would no longer be able to stop Hanikori in whatever it was he was doing. And she was sure he was up to no good.
Connection, people, life — these were fundamental things she would fight for. These were the things that any future she wanted to be a part of would have to built on. The swirling thoughts in her head had spiraled down to this one clear point. She knew she should emerge from alakh now and walk that path.
It was nearly midnight, but she reached out to Far Flier. As he made his way to her room, she let him feel her alakh. She opened the door for him.
“We will make a child, and we will make a new Guardians,” she said. “I will do this with you.”
She took him wordlessly to her bed. After they had made love, Far Flier guided her in coupling to begin the creation process. In the next few weeks, he would nurture the egg he had fertilized and received from her. His body, with its enhanced nano gene repair tech, would remove any mistakes, correct any serious diseases, build an energy transfer layer around it and wrap it in a protective gel.
When it was done, he would return to her, and they would perform the ancient ritual of transferring the embryo to her. Then her body would take over, and grow it until it was ready to be born. The time spent in both their bodies would allow the baby to immediately join their wave function, and its connection with them would pave its entrance into the larger community.
She knew that there would be pain and discomfort involved for both of them. Long ago, her species had tried to abolish all that by raising children outside the body. They learned the hard way that evolution had embedded in them the physicality of creation and birth. Both for the parents and the child, there were so many unforeseen and undesirable consequences to losing that experience. So they had contented themselves with merely making it safe.
In the early morning hours, they smiled and sang the first songs of new parents-to-be together. To feel such a chorus for the first time was an experience worth a little discomfort.</Text>

            <Text>In case of emergency
August 3, 2049
Diver could see that Raefe had been working on all night, tinkering with the empathy vectors. Joe had given him a sandbox space on the server farm to run a scaled down sim. He had been running recent history, starting with WWIII in 1951. The sim sometimes showed WWIV, in various years. Other times it showed increasing prosperity and peace. Nothing made any sense.
He and Lina had made so much progress in Africa. They were beginning to grasp the cycle of stress-induced evolution pushing their species toward greater interdependence. For 10,000 years, humans had been living in larger and larger groups. They had used their culture to balance the antagonisms their competitive sides experienced. Now they were nearing another nexus of this struggle, and they would have turn all their bodies had learned through 10,000 years of close quarters into new abilities, new ways of thinking and feeling. Just as her species had, and many before it.
The humans had a saying: if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Like all species in the optimization phase, they had a very big and powerful hammer — rationality. They had to discover that some nails were actually screws, and grasp what that meant.
“You are working so hard on this,” she said. “But you are not happy with the results.”
“If I can’t get the sim to play back something close to what’s already happened, what use is it in helping to understand what can make a difference in the future?”
“Not much,” she agreed. “Maybe you need to look at the problem differently.”
“You remind me of my 11th grade math teacher, always giving hints. I’d rather just know the answer.”
“This is not 11th grade mathematics,” she said sternly, although she actually had no idea what that meant. “You want to understand why 9 billion people who spoke thousands of languages and lived in hundreds of countries did what they did for four or five generations. You must go deeper.”
“Deeper where?”
“Everywhere. You are disappointed that you put empathy in your sim and it doesn’t tell you the future. What is empathy, anyway?”
“The ability to understand other people’s…Oh, you mean, what is it made of?”
“Yes! If I asked you what iron is, you wouldn’t say a hard metal. You’d say a substance made of protons, neutrons, and electrons that work together in this way, and so on.”
“So, what are the atomic elements of empathy?” he asked.
“What are the two fundamental things in the universe?” she said. He had come to expect her elliptical responses to direct questions about things he was clueless about.
“Matter and energy?” he said, thinking, food and sex, and I haven’t had one for hours and they other for weeks.
“Exactly! And how do they interact?”
“Through force fields, exchanged by particles?”
“That’s what Joe needs from you, that sort of analytic model. Obviously, there are not really particles of empathy. But how do humans experience empathy? How do they express it? Suppress it? What do they exchange, and what forces do those exchanges carry with them?”
“And here I thought you were going to tell me that the answer is 54.”
“I think you are, as you say, pulling my leg.”
“Massively. Really, you’ve given me a lot to think about.”
“I have confidence you will make progress. But I have to tell you some news.”
“Good, I hope.”
“Well, maybe your sim can tell you,” she laughed. She enjoyed the mental game humans called humor. “I have some things going on in my life that may affect when I’m available.”
“What’s going on with you?” he asked. She had never discussed her own life with him.
“I’m going to be a mother,” she said. “There may be times when I cannot entangle with you. I will train one of the other Guardians, Adno, to recognize you in the waveform. Perhaps you will entangle briefly, perhaps not. This is all new to me.”
“So you’re having a baby,” he asked, incredulous.
“Why is that so hard to believe?” she asked.
“I thought you were hundreds of years old and lived forever,” he said. “I figured you made replacements in a lab or something.”
“Evolution is its own laboratory. Many species think they can do better, but it turns out the best they can do is make minor improvements. Yes, I am 408 years old, but I will live about 2,000 years. I’m just a teenager, in your world. And we do have to reproduce, but not often. I will explain our lifecycle to you someday — it’s not exactly like yours.”
“So if I need you, and you don’t respond, I should snap my fingers and think ‘Adno?’”
“Yes, that will do. She will respond even if you don’t snap your fingers.”
“Cool. I’ll let Lina know. You said you had ‘things’ going on in your life. Is there more?”
She hesitated. She had wanted to tell him about the difficulties she and Far Flier were up against. But he couldn’t help and it would only scare him.
“No, that was it. Just wanted to make sure we keep our connections strong.”

            <Text>Bootstrapping
January 17, 2050
Raefe was beside himself with frustration. He had worked for months pursuing the direction that Diver had suggested. She had been of no further help, apparently wrapped up in her own life. At first, he had made some progress and could see that this direction could work. Joe had stepped up on his end, trying new kinds of math that could handle large numbers of variables interacting with each other non-linearly. Elise had adjusted the social aspects of the sim to reflect that. They had made significant progress.
In their 100 year sim, they could not exactly reproduce the current world. But the variations were no longer random and opposite. They seemed to want to converge. Joe had been convinced that it was a computer problem. He had managed to gain access, somehow, to MIT’s mos powerful server farms. When that didn’t work, he had called in a favor from a buddy at DigiBrands and gotten two weeks of time on a prototype system, their most advanced, before it went into production. Their project was labeled as test of the system. But it hadn’t worked.
He felt Lina tickling his mind.
“Raefe, the most wonderful thing has happened.”
“Glad someone’s having a good time.”
“Your sim is not going well?”
“You know it. And I’m just stuck. I’d love some good news — what’s up with you?”
“Remember Alton?”
“Sure.”
“Well, after you left, he and the Citizens did reach an agreement of sorts. The Citizens have a high council of sorts, although it’s pretty informal. They were very worried about allying with an army, as I predicted. Anyway, they decided to try a small joint project. So last September, 100 people from each group went off together, on their own, and built a small village. The test was to see if their economic system and our social system could work together and be something more than either.”
“And did it work?”
“It was working well. Fatima was one of the people, and last week, Edna asked me to visit and see how she was doing. Something amazing happened.”
“What? You’re killing me with suspense here.”
“Fatima tried in her way, to entangle with the other people, but she’s too new at it. But when I arrived, she asked me to help and something completely unexpected happened. Fatima couldn’t sense how close everyone was, but I felt it immediately. I tried reaching out to some individuals who seemed to have the strongest signals, but they were all strong. Raefe, we did it — we created the waveform that Diver talks about. All of a sudden, we could all sense each other, all 201 of us.”
“Holy shit. What was it like?”
“Was? Is! It is fantastic. Let me bring you into it!”
“How?”
“Just relax. You feel that?”
And just like that, as if he was looking out his window at 200 people in a park, he could feel each of their minds. It was a warm feeling, what his grandmother used to call a group hug. But it was complex and shaded. He could get lost in it.
“Yes, there’s so much to explore,” Lina said. “This is how life could be, so rich.”
“I wish I was there,” he said.
“But you are,” she answered. “You are here, just not in the old way.”
He didn’t know what to think. Just then he felt Alton’s mind.
“We meet again,” Alton said.
“I never imagined it would be like this,” Raefe said.
“Yet you seem unhappy,” Alton said.
“No, I’m very happy. But when Lina connected, I was very frustrated. I’ve been trying to understand what you all are doing on a bigger scale, working out how we can understand how this will change things.”
“Lina told me about your project,” Alton said. “It sounds super cool. Can we help?”
“Maybe,” Raefe said. “I haven’t succeeded in accurately describing empathy in all its glories — what activates it, deactivates it, how it interacts with competitiveness. All of these things get complicated very fast, and I’m just stuck.”
“I could understand that,” Alton said. “I was one of the first people Lina reached out to when she came here. It was a very cool experience. But it wasn’t the same as the waveform. Once we we were all connected, many things became clearer. I think we can help you, if you try and describe your problem.”
“It’s pretty technical,” Raefe said. “Particles and fields and all that.”
“That is just the words you use to describe it. Quiet your mind and let us see what you know and what you want to know”
Time slipped away. Raefe was no longer aware of whether it was light or dark, whether he was sitting or standing. A 200-way conversation of thoughts flowed in and around him, all focused on deeply probing empathy and how it changed what we think, feel, and do. In a lull, he thought “of course, one person can’t understand all of this,” and then was swept up again in the waveform. It wasn’t like 200 people talking and certainly not 200 people arguing or debating. It was 200 people with a common purpose, growing organically from their own experience and needs. Their waveform seemed at times like an actual ocean wave, breaking over the long open sea, bits of the truth bobbing to the surface as it passed over the deeps. The bits became a loose assemblage floating on the current that grew and took on a shape. He watched, fascinated, as the shape refined itself, its facets and recesses increasingly well defined. Still, it pulsed and changed as each person’s thoughts molded it.
By morning, he understood what needed to be done. The latest iteration of the 100 year sim was nearly perfect in describing the world as he knew it. He disconnected from the waveform, exhausted and ecstatic. He sent Joe and Elise the address of the perfected sim and slept as deeply as he ever had.

            <Text>The Long Game
March 19, 2050
Far Flier had been dreading this day for months. But now that it was here, he felt oddly calm. Good, he thought, that is what my part of the waveform will feel like. At least he could rob Hanikori of the satisfaction of him being visibly humiliated in front of the council he had led for hundreds of year.
The department heads droned through their reports. For months, Far Flier had tried to rally Tanoch to some enthusiasm over Lina’s conversion of her village to sustain a waveform. Or to Raefe’s leverage of that waveform to make great strides in understanding how humanity’s social and biological evolution were interdependent. Tanoch, who had always been his strongest supporter, merely grunted and nodded with underwhelming enthusiasm. Far Flier had asked him point blank why he seemed so indifferent, but Tanoch hemmed and hawed and mumbled something about being overwhelmed by his imminent transformation to his species’ hermaphroditic phase.
Then their was Manulo, who had usually been a sensible council member. She was actually quite impressed with the Civilization Project’s final algorithms. Very advanced in some aspects, was how she had put it. Groundbreaking even. But Manulo, as always, was lost in her world of n-dimensional tensors and oblivious to the nuances of normal Council operations. She was barely 200 years old, so maybe time would teach her to engage more with other people. But for now, she saw Far Flier’s struggles as a distraction.
Far Flier knew that Hanikori had recruited Green and Putnomo to his plan. So it was him and two uninterested Council members against this band of three. Not really a winning hand. He suspected that Green might someday reject Hanikori — the young temporal engineer was basically an honest person and would have trouble with Hanikori’s sociopathic tendencies in the long run, he thought. But for today, he was onboard with Hanikori’s plan, which was becoming increasingly clear and alarming to Far Flier. He would keep that knowledge to himself and Diver, though, and continue to dig until he had the full measure of it.
Hanikori was the last of the department heads to give his report. Much ado about nothing, as usual. Maybe being the victim of the first coup in Guardian history isn’t so bad after all, he thought, if it means not having to let this claptrap into his mind.
“Thank you, Hanikori,” he said. “Council members, I want to thank you for your reports. And now I have my own report to give.”
There was a minor ripple in the waveform.
“You all know that Diver and I are having a child together. Sometime in the next decades, I will also transform to female. Both suggest that I can either miss the full joy of either to maintain my Council chair duties, or take another path. After more than 400 years in this role, I have decided to step down from both the chair and the council.”
“What will you do?” asked Green.
“I have some research projects that I’ve been working on slowly in the background  for years. And every Guardian Council chair tries to summarize the lessons of his or her tenure in their Annals, as part of our permanent record. Between that and my personal life, I think I will be productively busy.”
“As head of Administration, it falls to me to lead the process of picking a new chair,” Hanikori said. “In the meantime, I’m sure everyone here joins me in thanking you for your service.”
And with that, it was over. Hanikori had succeeded, Far Flier was still in the dark about what his final goal was, and the Guardians were entering one the most dangerous periods in hundreds of millenia.

            <Title>In this chapter,</Title>
            <Text>In this chapter, something triggers a conflict in Nigeria and Raefe and/or Lina go with Alton. They witness firsthand how violence emerges from small conflicts unbidden. They see how entanglement can make that less likely by revealing people’s true motivations.

Lina and Edna can sense that a group of raiders has Edna’s daughter and are about to rape her. Edna remembers her own gang rape from the past. She makes the men feel what she felt then. They’re taken aback and don’t know who or what is making them feel this. Their leader wants them to proceed. Raefe senses that he is a sociopath, that he cares nothing for his own men, or their stated cause. He thinks they are weak and inferior and need him. He lets Alton feel this and together, they let the raiders feel this. They desert their leader.
Later, Alton tells Goodstuff about it. They talk excitedly about this as a new direction for their “army.”

Part 2
Raefe discovers how to simulate the future, based on economy, culture and empathy. He makes contact with global academics who are interested in the future.
Lina makes contact with Nowhere, gets them to begin to entangle.
Raefe and Lina help bring together a community in central Africa of Nowhere and NVA, helped by academics, to build a new kind of future.</Text>

            <Text>Prelude to a storm
November 14, 2048
It was Saturday and Raefe was, for once, not going to bother with work. The Titan Towers sim could wait until Monday. Cleaning his apartment could wait until tomorrow. His MiniWorlds pay had just been deposited and he was full up on credits. The cool rains of November had ceased, for once, and he was going to enjoy the day.
He clicked his Voice on.
“Manny, Raefe. Are you around?”
A second later, Manny clicked in.
“What’s up Raefe?”
“Got a chip full of credits, a nice day, and no work. What’s up with you?”
“The same. Me and Raquel are going to the club tonight, but I’m free until then. You’re welcome to come later, too, if you want.”
“I’ll probably pass on that. I thought maybe things were going to get in motion with someone at work, but turns out she’s in a girl phase right now. And I’m not in the mood for working the crowd at the club.”
“I hear you. Well, we got the whole afternoon. You want to meet up on the Harbor Trail?”
“Cool. Say 1?”
“Yeah, Castle Island at 1.”
He clicked the call off and got stuff together for the bike ride down to Castle Island. Hopping on his bike, he avoided looking left at the MinWorlds building next store. He didn’t even want to see it today. Monday he’d go back to being a grunt. Today was his.
He tooled out through TechTown and into North Point, then over the bridge into Boston, picking up the river trail. A few minutes later, he was pedaling at full speed, feeling the ocean breeze as it started to filter into the city. He loved this little stretch of trail. It was usually pretty empty and he could ride fast, the wind in his face. And then up a little hill and down and there was the whole harbor, out in front of him. 
He barely remembered the view before the trail had been built. In ‘31, a little before his third birthday, the long-predicted rising seas had finally hit Boston, flooding everything along the waterfront. In typical fashion, the city had none nothing about it, despite a number of lesser repeats. But in the aftermath of the economic crash six years later, some smart person had made sure that all property on the waterfront — now an economic disaster of its own — was bought up, leveled and turned into a sort of levee to protect against future storms. The crest of the levee was a flat, winding strip about 50 meters wide, with a bike trail running down the center.
It was a typical early November day, low ‘60s and breezy. Another month and it would be four months of slush. He wound his way along the trail, the sun shining off the water.</Text>

            <Text>White Christmas
December 22, 2081

Raefe knew something was wrong as soon as he opened his eyes. The sun had just risen over Newcastle, a time when the various minds that wandered in and out of the the ruined tenement off Whitehall Street were usually deep in dreams.  Now he could feel a tense energy from Gordo and his Urban Gypsies.
“You’re up early,” he thought, reaching out to Gordo.
“Just about to wake you,” Gordo replied. “We’ve got to move.”
“I’ll be right there.”
He pulled on some pants and a shirt and made his way across the warren of rooms, halls and broken down walls that traversed the block of flats on the second floor. Below, the first floor was little more than sidewalls and rubble that had been torched during one of the battles between Hindu and Muslim refugees in ‘74. Gordo was hunched over a map in the room that served as the Gypsies headquarters.
“You heard the weather?” Gordo asked without looking up.
“More about the Gulf Stream disappearing?” Raefe asked.
“It’s official. Five straight days of plunging ocean surface temperatures. Dropped 4 degrees in one day — never been seen before in recorded history. Gulf Stream officially submerged, Greenland ice melt covering the North Atlantic. Very cold winds started building up off Iceland yesterday afternoon.”
“So why the early morning drill?”
“We’ll probably have to evacuate to warmer ground,” Gordo said. “First estimates are for historic snows within the week — two to three meters is the guess.This neighborhood will be buried by the blizzard and the city will leave it that way until nature melts it. We could be buried alive if we stayed. At best, we’d starve to death in a few weeks.”
“You don’t think we’d be rescued?” Raefe asked.
“Publicly, the government is talking bravely about protecting everyone in Northern England. But I don’t trust McDornish or any of his top people to stick it out. We have some contacts in his security force — they’re busy lining up transportation to sunnier climes. And so should we — there’s nothing we can do here anymore.”
“Where can we go?” Raefe asked.
“Out of Northern England — It’s going to be part of the same ice cube as Scotland and Ireland. Maybe even the Irish Sea will freeze over. So it’s Cornwall,” Gordo answered. “The last of the Gulf Stream still reaches that far. Warm winds will turn the snow to rain down there, but at least we won’t freeze to death.”
“How are we going to get over the border into the South?”
“We’re working on it. Can you help?”
“Well, if I had any friends in the City of London, Limited, they might grease the skids for entry into the Republic of South England. But maybe a friend of a friend — some of the minor corpos occasionally waver in their affection for economic dictatorship. I’ll see what I can do.”
Back in his room, he decided to contact Lina. It was an hour later in Nigeria, and she was an early riser anyway. He let his mind wander, settling into the noise of so many minds, and reached out for her. Soon, she responded.
“My northern light,” she said, “What raises you from sleep so early?”
“Your equatorial warmth, my dear,” he replied. “Newcastle is pretty cool, as my great-grandfather might have said, but now it’s in danger of becoming just cold. Very cold.” He explained what was going on.
“This is what we feared for twenty years,” she said. “And now it may come to pass. What can you do?”
“For now, not much. We have to go south or we could be trapped in a killer storm. That means South England and that means United Financial Services territory. The Gypsies are hoping to find a friend to keep us off USF’s radar until I get to the Low Islands and friends. Do you think anyone in Kuti has friendly contacts in South England?”
“Very likely.  USF has waged an on again, off again campaign against Nigerian cybergangs for decades. Sometimes they buy off the best hackers and move them to London. Maybe someone here has a relative, or a friend. Most of the cybergangs are thugs, but every now and then one of them helps the Voodo Republic. Insurance policy, I guess.”
“I can help,” a voice said, joining the waveform.
“Nyssa,” Raefe said, “so good to hear you. You were listening in?”
“No, not really. But some part of me feels when both of you are connected. Instead of just the feel of single thoughts, it’s more like a chord. Did you know that? The two of you always make the same chord, like it’s your theme music. I’ve been worried about you, dad, hearing the news about the weather in Scotland.”
“You always find new ways to amaze me, daughter,” Lina said. 
“Well, Des can do the same,” Nyssa said. “More actually. He can hear the chord for a whole group of people. When we were kids, sometimes we would hide from you two. I could feel the two of you coming. But once, mom, you came with Edna and Fatima and a whole bunch of others and he knew it right away. He told me every person that was coming and he got it right.”
“Another time we should talk about what this means, how it might be developed for good,” Lina said. “But for now, how might you help your father?”
“Do you remember that boy I liked when I was a teenager? Manfred?”
“You mean the one we both hated?” Raefe said.
“Yes, that one. Well, you were mostly right about him. He wound up going to Lagos to one of the corpo unis there. He’s very bright, you know, and he was ambitious back then — not so interested in the greater good. He was recruited by a local subsidiary of UFS and they moved him to London four or five years ago. He’s married and all that, but we kept in touch just a bit and you weren’t totally right. Turns out he’s actually appalled by corpo life and doesn’t know what to do — they basically own him, so he can’t just walk out. I was just talking to him last week. He wants to know how he can help.”
“Do you trust him? Have you entangled with him?” Lina asked.
“More tangled than entangled,” she laughed. “But that was a long time ago. No, he’s afraid of that. Still I get some vibes from him, so yes, I think I can trust him.”
“We’re thinking of going to Devon. Is there anyway he can help there?”
“I’ll ask. Sit tight, I’ll let you know soon.”</Text>

            <Text>White Christmas
December 22, 2081

Raefe woke with a start. He could hear noises from out in the hall. It was still night, just a bit of moonlight filtering in through the small window high up on his cell wall. Now he could see dark shapes running by the small window in the cell door. He dressed quickly and stood on the wooden chair, faced pressed to the window.
The shapes were prison guards, running back and forth, yelling to each other. Between the thickness of the door and their accent, he couldn’t make out anything they were saying. He tried to read their thoughts, but they were a jumble of fear and panic and confusion. Something bad was happening, that much was sure.
“Inmates, step back from your doors,” boomed the PA speakers in the hall. He jumped down and pulled the chair back. The door popped open. “All inmates, report to the cafeteria.”
He walked down the hall, eerily reminiscent of the student housing he had briefly lived in more than 30 years ago. After a week in jail, the way to the caf was now familiar. He joined a parade of men, most of whom were grumpy about being awakened from drunken or drug-induced stupors. A few showed the ill effects of having been in a fight. Many were swearing at the absent guards. Raefe decided silence was his best option until he knew what was going on.
He felt Gordo’s thoughts reaching out to him from outside the jail.
“Are you OK?” Gordo asked. “I felt a surge from you a few minutes ago.”
“Yeah, I’m OK. We were just woken up. Something’s going on.”
“It’s the weather, it’s worsened. Maybe they’re shipping you out.”
“Where to?”
“No idea. But everyone here is ready to come help, if you need it.”
“Thanks, I’ll let you know.”
The cafeteria was dark, lit only by some kind of battery-powered emergency lights. The wall clock said 5:03 AM. There were half a dozen uniforms against one wall. Two had electroguns, the rest more lethal armaments. There were about three dozen inmates scattered around the room. A man in a suit stood on raised platform, bullhorn in hand.
“If you’ll all kindly take a seat, we’ll make this brief,” he said. “Thank you. Most of you know that the last three months have been unseasonably cold. In the last week, we are told, things have taken a turn for the worse. We’re already seeing the heaviest snows ever recorded in Scotland, and those storms are headed our way. We’re being told that within three days Newcastle will be hit by a blizzard that could last up to two weeks. Electric lines will go down, wind turbines will freeze, and solar panels will be buried. Our emergency batteries can only last for 48 hours if we have to use them.”
Faced with the prospect of a being stuck in a jail with no heat or light, the inmates started to grumble.
“We have considered evacuating the jail and moving all of you temporarily to facilities in the South. For a variety of reasons, we have decided against that. Given that all of you are here for minor offenses, and will undoubtedly give us cause to arrest you again in the future, we have gotten permission from a magistrate to release you on your own recognizance. You must, of course, show up for your trial date, but for now, you’ll be free to go. We’ve woken you up early so that you can contact friends or family to come get you. All prisoners must leave by noon today. The prison will be closed after that.”
Raefe had expected a big cheer from the other inmates, but the room was quiet. He could sense that they were uneasy, fearful of what they would be walking into outside. They grabbed breakfast rolls and coffee like they might not see food again for a week. Raefe did the same, his mind reaching out to find Gordo.
“They’re kicking us out of jail. What the hell is going on?”
“Remember that controversy a couple of months ago about whether the Gulf Stream was being submerged? Well, it’s settled. Gone diving. Ocean surface temps in the North Atlantic have dropped by more than five degrees in the last few days. And the current has reversed course — no more warm southern water bathing England. Now it’s Greenland ice melt coming south. Scotland is getting battered by 40 mile an hour winds, temps of minus 10, and now a snow storm that’s expected to last for days. Actually, no end in sight.”
“The warden or whatever he his said the storm’s headed here. I have to leave by noon.”
“We’ll send someone to meet you at the prison. They can be there by half ten. OK?”
“Can’t wait. Hey, someone’s coming. Let’s talk later.”
He saw one of the guards walking his way, not one he’d seen before.
“Miller-Epstein? Come with me.”
He followed the guard down the hall, into a small office. Another guard sat behind a desk, but a vaguely South Asian man in civilian clothes sat alongside him.
“Do you know who I am?” the man asked.
Ah, that voice, Raefe thought. I know you.
“You’re Benjamin McDornish.” Son of an Indian mother and a Northern England father. As rabid a racist as any of the snow white members of the Northern Alliance that he lead. If there were Muslim or Slav or Chinese heads to bash, you have to prove no man or woman is more enthusiastic than you, don’t you, Raefe thought. 
“Very good. Do you know why I’m here?”
To scare me, Raefe thought. To tell me that the full weight of your racist thugs will be applied if I don’t leave Newcastle by midnight. Or that you know where Lina is. Or really anything that a man desperately on the wrong side of history says to pretend that’s not true. He let McDornish’s thoughts wash over him. The man though of him as prey. Right now, he wanted to play with his catch. Raefe decided not to cooperate.
“No,” he said, keeping his voice quiet and flat.
“You’re going back out on the street in a few hours, and I want you to understand something.”
Raefe stood, silent. McDornish was going to try and goad him a few more times, he was pretty sure.
“No doubt your friends will come get you. They’ll tell you how dangerous this storm is. The storm is not your biggest problem.”
This guy has watched too many old vids, Raefe thought. He’s going to tell me he is.
“A good coat and a fireplace will save you from the storm. They won’t save you from me if I want to hurt you.”
He wanted Raefe to ask him why he would hurt him. Raefe stayed silent, his face expressionless. McDornish stood up, as if to menace Raefe, but the steam was leaking out of him now. He turned to the guard.
“Get him out of here. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, Epstein.”
The guard walked him silently back to his cell. He had nothing much to pack so he read for awhile. At 9AM, the doors all opened. He went to the intake room and reclaimed his civilian clothes and a few personal things from a clerk. He checked his coat pocket — no one had stolen his gloves or hat, thankfully. The hot water heater was already turned off, so he skipped the shower. He dressed silently, feeling the other inmate’s mix of emotions. Glad to be leaving, scared to not know why or where, putting whatever face on it their temperaments led them to. He had been kept away from them during the week, isolated. There was no one to say good bye to.
There was a vid screen in one of the guard offices. The door was open as he walked by and he stopped to watch. Somewhere north, howling winds were filling the streets with snow. Vehicles were buried, you couldn’t see more than 20 meters, and there was no one on the street. A weather map came on the screen. A huge band of white covered all of Northern England, Scotland and Ireland, extending northward almost to Iceland and eastward halfway to Denmark.
At 10:30, he buttoned up his top button and stepped out of the jail on to the street. Two of Gordo’s mates hustled him into a car and they went across the Tyne to Gateshead. They wound their way through the ruined tenements off Whitehall Street until they came to Gordo’s squat, an intact second floor flat sitting on top of a street-level that was little more than sidewalls and rubble. The insides had been torched during one of the battles between Hindu and Muslim refugees in ‘74. The usual crowd of students from the university, unemployed workers, and neighborhood toughs  seemed slightly more animated today, the threat of catastrophe pushing them out of their usual routines.
“Come on up,” he heard Gordo’s thoughts. Inside Gordo’s flat, there were piles of backpacks and supplies.
“We’re evacuating to warmer ground,” Gordo said. “This neighborhood will be buried by the blizzard and the city will leave it that way until nature melts it. We’d be buried alive if we stayed.”
“Where can we go?” Raefe asked.
“Cornwall,” Gordo answered. “The last of the Gulf Stream still reaches there. Warm winds will turn the snow to rain down there, but at least we won’t freeze to death.”
“How are we going to get over the border into the South?”
“We’re going to Liverpool. A boat will take us south of the border to Wales. There’s a large forest area, Snowdonia, used to be a park for campers and the like. There’s some people will takes through there, and then well, it’s complicated, but there are people who will get us to Cornwall.”
“You trust them not to turn us over to the corpos?”
“Don’t know much about Wales, do you?”
“Nothing,” Raefe laughed.”
“These lads, their great-grandads were thrown out of work by the first of the corpos, back in Iron Maggie’s day. Four generations is nothing at all for them to hold a grudge, especially considering the corpos in the City take ever opportunity to stick it to them. You’re safe with this lot — they’d never do anything to help the City.”
“Does Lina know the plan?”
“Yes, we’ve been  in touch. She has some ideas she wants to discuss with you, so whenever you get the chance…”
“Right. When we’re on the road.”
“Perfect. Grab some kit — we need to get out of here while we can.”
Gordo had kept Raefe’s clothes and puter while he was in the slammer. Someone had put them in a pack, along with winter gear and some food. He put the coat and the pack on and grabbed some boxes of food. There were about twenty people packing three good-sized box trucks with Northern Electric written on the side. Gordo laughed at Raefe’s puzzled expression.
“We’ve got a rental agreement,” Gordo said. “Very low rate. Gives us a ready reason to be on the road. You’ll be in that truck, with Claire. She actually does worth for Northern and knows the drill, so she’ll do all the talking if it comes to that.”
Raefe walked over to the truck Gordo had indicated.
“Where do you want the food,” he asked Claire, a short, very dark skinned woman who looked to be about 35.
It sounded like she answered “All the way up front,” her thick Scots accent turning the words into taffy.
“And me?”
“You stay in the back until we get near Leeds. Can’t have McDornish’s men spotting you around here. We’ll switch off after that.”
There were six of them in the back, sandwiched between the food up front and boxes of spare parts for wind turbines in the back. They’d pass no more than a cursory inspection if it came to that. Someone outside pulled the truck door down and the inside went dark. Claire started the motors, and they were off, bouncing down the rough streets. He heard a voice talking quietly on a mobile and the interior lights went on.


Claire had pulled down a side road into an old abandoned barn. She opened the back door.
“Right, your with me,” she said, pointing to Raefe.
They pulled back on the main road. The snows hadn’t reached here yet, but the traffic was very light.
“Where are the other two trucks?” he asked.
“Gone different routes,” she said. “Better that way, draws less attention. No reason for three trucks to be heading away from an emergency.”
He touched her mind lightly. She hadn’t learned to entangle, maybe she never would. He could sense that she was calm, used to dodgey circumstances.
“You really work for the electric company?” he asked.
“When there’s work, yeah. Northern England’s a bit of a part time affair, you know.”
“But you’re from Scotland?”
“Aye, born and raised. Me dad was a tidal power engineer in South Africa. During the civil war there, he went to Scotland to catch on at one of the island power stations. He met me mom there — she was a clerk up from Glasgow to do the accounting and such.”
“So you grew up on one of those remote little islands?”
“Was born there, but they went back to Glasgow after a hurricane wrecked the plant. Was hard times for them, and me, in the rough part of Glasgow.”
“And from Glasgow to Newcastle?” he asked.
“Bad judgment.”
“How so?”
“Let’s just say I never felt at home in Glasgow. Even the way I talk, people still would ask me where I was from. Ask any black Scot, you’ll hear the same. Some go all the way back hundreds of years there, too, but no mind. Even the posh ones. Never had our own tartan, I guess.”
“No better in Northern England, is it?”
“Worse. But I was fooled by all that talk when the Northern Brigades rebelled against the City. They sounded like proper revolutionaries to me, out with the old and all that. Sounded good. Was good, for a little while. Then it was, the North for Northerners, even if half of them are Hindus now. And I was back to where was you born? Maybe if I was a little lighter and had a different face, I could have passed for a Hindu, but they saw me and I was nothing but an African here to take what jobs they still had.”
“This island is like America, that way,” he said. “There was no one here at all thousands of years ago — The whole place was a hundred feet of solid ice. Like maybe Scotland will be hundreds of years from now, the way things are going. Everyone came here from somewhere else. And it’s just a shouting match about who’s here the longest, who’s the true Brits and so on. America’s the same — the only true Americans are mostly gone and everyone else thinks a few generations qualifies them.”
“Indeed. You think it will ever change?”
“Has to,” he said. “Change or die, those are the choices.”
“But how? I see them risk their lives for McDornish and his bunch. And all they get out of it is what they call Northern Pride. How do you fight that?”
“Anyway we can,” he said. “Any way we can get people to see that we can only survive the world we’ve made by banding together and making it right again.”
“But what’s your plan? We’re risking our lives to get you South. When we get you there, what will you do to make me feel I risked my life for a good reason?”
“You already answered that. You’ve been risking your life for years, just trying to walk down the street. There is no God or Jesus or Vishnu or whomever who is going to lead us out of this wilderness. There’s just us. And there’s a lot of us, most of us, even, everywhere. Many ideas about the future. We’ll all figure it out, bit by bit.”
He could see that she wasn’t persuaded.
“You want me to tell you that if we do such and such, in a few years, this will all be over and life will be great?”
“That would be nice,” she said. “You think I’m stupid to want that?”
“To want that?” he said. “No, who wouldn’t want that? To believe that there’s a shortcut to that, that might be stupid. Your father’s country, they fought for four or five generations just to get the right for a black person to sit next to a white person in public. We have a whole world to change.”
“What makes you think we’ll do better than my father’s country?”
“Because they thought it was just a matter of taking from the people who took from them. Actually, they took some of the first steps on the road we’re on, letting the old oppressors own up to their sins and then accepting them back into society. Take McDornish’s gang — say we somehow could kill all of them. But they have families, friends who then will hate us and we’ll never end that cycle of victor and vanquished. Most of them are no different than this lot — people with their backs up against it.”
“I’m not like them,” she said, her face cloudy with anger.
“No, you’re not,” he said. “Now. But like you said, they seemed righteous when they started. But they forgot something.”
“What?”
“That the point of fighting is not destroying your opponent. It’s changing what made you need to fight. It’s finding the connection that binds, not cleaves. Do  children play the game of musical chairs here?”
“Yes,” she smiled. 
“Life cannot just be a game of musical chairs, don’t you think? People didn’t struggle for thousands of years to make a better life just to turn it into a game of winners and losers, more and more losing until there’s just a few winners.”
“But that’s human nature, isn’t it?”
“Ah, but which human nature? The human nature of the first people who figured out how to make a fire, or a bow and arrow, and showed everyone else how to do it, gladly and for free? Or the human nature of the drug corpos, who get uni students to discover life saving drugs for next to nothing, than want to patent them so only those who can pay can have it? What we call human nature isn’t really natural. You can’t find any other animals that are willing to kill half of their own kind.”
“So back to nature, is it? A dogs life. I didn’t have you figured for a back to nature type. More like one of them teachers at the uni, what I heard.”
He smiled. “Maybe I think we should go forward to nature, not back. I just feel it in people, that they could live without fear and hatred and violence, but they can’t figure out how. I just want us to give it a go, to try, before we finally top ourselves as a species.”
“Yeah, okay, I can respect that. Still, you might need a hard girl like me along the way, right?” she said, grinning at him.
“Yeah, probably,” he laughed. “Then we’ll have to figure out how to soften you up.”

            <Text>Keep on trucking
Newcastle, Northern England
October 29, 2081
“We’re going to Liverpool,” Claire announced as she put her ancient Voice away. “There’s some Gypsies there and they say the Northern Guard has been quiet. No roadblocks, checkpoints, none of that sort of thing.”
They had been hiding out waiting for their plan to evolve in a part of Newcastle where McDornish’s cover was thin. The Northern Guard rarely ventured into this territy. Minutes later, Gordo arrived driving a Northern Electric van.
“Your gear’s in the back, mate,” he said. “Wished your visit had turned out differently.”
“Don’t be silly,” Raefe said. “Life during wartime and all that. The Gypsies are doing great work. You guys did great in Tyneside. We’ll see if Everywhere can send more people to help with empathy training — some of your crew may be naturals and they all feel hungry for it. Just wish I could stay to see that through.”
Gordo could see Raefe’s puzzled look at the truck.
“We’ve got a rental agreement, you might say,” Gordo said. “Very low rate. Gives us a ready reason to be on the road. You’ll be in that truck, with Claire. She actually does worth for Northern and knows the drill, so she’ll do all the talking if it comes to that.”
Raefe walked over to the truck Gordo had indicated.
“Where do you want me?” he asked Claire.
“You stay in the back until we put some distance from Newcastle. Can’t have McDornish’s men spotting you around here. We’ll switch off after that.”
There were six of them in the back, sandwiched between the food up front and boxes of spare parts for wind turbines in the back. They’d pass a cursory inspection if they had to, but no more than that. Someone outside pulled the truck door down and the inside went dark. Claire started the motor, and they were off, bouncing down the rough streets. He heard a voice talking quietly on a mobile and the interior lights went on.
Gordo was up front with Claire, for now. Here in the back were Ea, along with her girfriend, Trina, who sat next to her, nervously twirling her blond curls. Sitting closest to the back door were Mikey and Ganesh. They both had old British Army submachine guns with large magazines.
“For McDornish’s gang,” Ganesh said, as if reading Raefe’s thoughts.
“Do we have intel on them?” Raefe asked. “What’s old Benjamin the true Briton doing?”
“I hacked their shit,” Ea said. She sat in front of an impressive looking puter, scanning a variety of apps for signals.  “He’s in Manchester, as usual. But he’s got small teams all about this area, looking for you.”
“Hopefully they haven’t thought about Claire’s Northern Electric connection,” Raefe said.
“Not so fast,” Ea said. “I’m picking up drone traffic now.”
“Could be South England,” Mikey observed.
“No, coming from the north,” Ea said. She banged on the front wall of the cabin with a rhythmic tap.
“That’s her secret signal to Claire, mate,” Ganesh winked at Raefe. “What’s that one mean, Ea?”
“Get the fuck out of sight, toute suite,” she said.
“Drones first, Benjie’s Viking squad next,” Mikey said. “Rape, pillage and leave. Not this truck.”
“Used to getting their way with people, that lot,” Ganesh said. “It’s what they know. Fighting the climate just confuses them.”
The truck lurched as Claire pulled down a side road into an old abandoned barn. She opened the back door.
“Protective measures, lads,” she said.
Mikey and Ganesh climbed up on top of the truck. Ea threw a roll of some kind of film up to them. They spread the film on the roof.
“It’s a sticky metallic film,” Claire explained to Raefe. “Usually the cop drones have infrared cameras. Can’t hide the engine up front, but the film will block thermal emissions from you lot. It’ll make the vehicle look more like a car than a truck. Confuse them, at least for awhile. You’re with me now.”
“Will we see them, the drones?” Raefe asked her.
“Maybe, if the sunlight hits one. Normally they’re too high, and quiet. They’re just watchers, no missiles or anything. Northern England’s too poor to have a drone air force like the South does.”
He climbed into the cab with her and they pulled back on the main road. He touched her mind lightly. She hadn’t learned to entangle, maybe she never would. He could sense that she was calm, used to dodgey circumstances.
“You really work for the electric company?” he asked.
“When there’s work, yeah. Northern England’s a bit of a part time affair, you know.”
“The company or the country?” he asked.
“Bit of both,” she laughed. “But the company, mostly. McDornish’s obsession with power doesn’t always extend to electric power. Can’t be bothered with how the plebes live, most of the time, despite all the yammering. He makes a show of it now and then, and you never hear the end of it. But day to day, he’s more worried about fending off the corpos down South.”
“My impression, too. But you’re from Scotland?”
“Aye, born and raised. Me dad was a tidal power engineer in Sofricar. After the war between the pro- and anti-Chinese factions in Kenya spilled over into Sofricar, he went to Scotland to catch on at one of the island power stations. He met me mom there — she was a clerk up from Glasgow to do the accounting and such.”
Another fugee from Sofricar or Efricar, he thought. If this Gulf stream trend worsens and Europe freezes up, will the flow reverse? Will we all retrace our ancestors’ steps and find the savannah again?
“Wow, so if you had stayed, you might be a Citizen of Nowhere by now,” he said. “Strange world we live in. But you grew up on one of those remote little power station islands?”
“Was born there, but they went back to Glasgow after a hurricane wrecked the plant. Was hard times for them, and me, in the rough part of Glasgow.”
“And from Glasgow to Newcastle?” he asked. The rough part of Glasgow was a walk in the park in Newcastle.
“Bad judgment.”
“How so?”
“Let’s just say I let a bad situation get to me. I never felt at home in Glasgow. Even though eyes closed they couldn’t tell me from a snow white highlander, people still would ask me where I was from. Ask any black Scot, you’ll hear the same. Some go all the way back hundreds of years there, too, but no mind. Even the posh ones. Never had our own tartan, I guess.”
“No better in Northern England?”
“Worse. But I was fooled by all that talk when the Northern Brigades rebelled against the City in ‘73. They sounded like proper revolutionaries to me, out with the old, in with the new and all that. Soon as I was done with school, I headed there. They all had Goodstuff Benjamin posters on their walls and the clubs played that Afro-punk remix of “Bloody Sunday” that was huge back then. Sounded good. Was good, for a little while. Then there was some trouble with the gangs and one thing lead to another. And it was the North for Northerners, even if half of them are Hindus now. And I was back to ‘where was you born?’ Maybe if I was a little lighter and had a different face, I could have passed for a Hindu, but they saw me and I was nothing but an African here to take what jobs they still had.”
Her tale of industrial decline seemed odd out here in the empty countryside. Snow still covered the ground, and there wasn’t much to see besides scraggly stands of trees every so often. Way off, he could see a cluster of smallish houses. A large balloon floated above the cluster, tethered by a sizable electric cable. Solar collector balloons were popular in sparsely populated areas.
Claire jerked the wheel hard down a side road.
“What?” he asked.
“Those balloons. Never know if they have surveillance cameras on them. They put ‘em up high so the lads can’t damage them.”
“Strange, isn’t it?” he mused. “There was no one here at all thousands of years ago — The whole place was a hundred feet of solid ice. Like maybe Scotland will be hundreds of years from now, the way things are going with the Gulf Stream. Everyone came here from somewhere else. And it’s just a shouting match about who’s here the longest, who’s the true Brits and so on. America’s the same — the only true Americans are mostly gone and everyone else thinks a few generations qualifies them to keep anyone new out. Even those who weren’t indigenous — the biggest group from outside North America are the descendants of slaves. Tell that to the NeoConfederates and they’ll tell you God saved America for white people. Never ones to be bothered by the facts, our homegrown racists.”
“Indeed. You think it will ever change?”
“Has to,” he said. “Change or die, those are the choices.”
“But how? I see these blokes risk their lives for McDornish and his bunch. And all they get out of it is what they call Northern Pride. You heard it at Maggie’s. How do you fight that?”
“Any way we can,” he said. “Any way we can get people to see that we can only survive the world we’ve made by banding together and making it right again. Human pride. Anyway, I thought you did a great job of getting them to consider that they were fighting the wrong fight, and on the wrong side of it at that.”
He felt her resistance, the same resistance he had felt a million times over the last 30 years. Deep down, we know we’re a long shot, he thought. But he still felt the power of connection and he was dammed if he was going to give that up and cry in his beer.
“But what’s your plan?” Claire said, as if she had read his mind. “We’re risking our lives to get you South. When we get you there, what will you do to make me feel I risked my life for a good reason?”
“You already answered that. You’ve been risking your life for years, just trying to walk down the street. There is no God or Jesus or Allah or Vishnu or whomever is going to lead us out of this wilderness. It’s not me — I’m just the first guy to figure out he has empathic powers and see what can be done with them. If it wasn’t for my wife, Lina, I probably wouldn’t even have figured that out. No, there’s just us. And there’s a lot of us, most of us, even, everywhere. Many ideas about the future. We’ll all figure it out, bit by bit. It will take generations, but there’s not time to waste.”
He could see that she wasn’t persuaded.
“You want me to tell you that if we do such and such, in a few years, this will all be over and life will be great?”
“That would be nice,” she said. “You think I’m stupid to want that?”
“To want that?” he said. “No, who wouldn’t want that? To believe that there’s a shortcut to that, that might be stupid. Your parents’ country, they fought for four or five generations just to get the right for a black person to sit next to a white person in public. We have a whole world to change.”
“What makes you think we’ll do better than my father’s country?”
“Actually, they took some of the first steps on the road we’re on. They rose up, but then they let the old oppressors own up to their sins and then accepted them back into society. Right now, some of the Gypsies  want to wipe the Guard off the face of the Earth.”
“Isn’t that the point of fighting?” she said. 
“No. The point of fighting is not winning, it’s not destroying your opponent. It’s changing what made you need to fight — hunger, oppression, or now, no homes, no water, no food. We don’t have time to waste just to feed our thirst for vengance. We have to find the connections that bind, not cleave.”
“Yeah, that’s righteous,” she said. “Just wanted to hear you say it.” And she laughed.
He knew she hadn’t totally made up her mind. She wanted to be pushed in that direction, and she was happy for him to do it.
“Do children play the game of musical chairs here?”
“Yes,” she smiled. 
“Life cannot just be a game of musical chairs, don’t you think? People didn’t struggle for thousands of years to make a better life just to turn it into a game of winners and losers, more and more losing until there’s just a few places to sit.”
“But that’s human nature, isn’t it?”
“Ah, but which human nature? The human nature of the first people who figured out how to make a fire, or a bow and arrow, and showed everyone else how to do it, gladly and for free? Or the human nature of the drug corpos, who get uni students to discover life saving drugs for next to nothing, try them out on poor people and prisoners, and then patent them so only those who can pay through the nose can have it? What we call human nature isn’t really natural. You can’t find any other animals that are willing to kill half of their own kind.”
“So back to nature, is it? A dog’s life. I didn’t have you figured for a back to nature type. More like one of them teachers at the uni, what I heard.”
He smiled at the idea of him as a professor. Roshi would be throwing up if she knew. “Maybe I think we should go forward to nature, not back. I just feel it in people, that they could live without fear and hatred and violence, we have it in us, but we’re trapped in a dance we can’t figure out how to stop. I just want us to give it a go, to try, before we finally top ourselves as a species.”
“Yeah, okay, I can respect that. Still, you might need a hard girl like me along the way, right?” she said, grinning at him. “Someone who can beat the drones and the Vikings.”
“Yeah, probably,” he laughed. “Then we’ll have to figure out how to soften you up.”

“But how? I see these blokes risk their lives for McDornish and his bunch. And all they get out of it is what they call Northern Pride. How do you fight that?”
“Anyway we can,” he said. “Any way we can get people to see that we can only survive the world we’ve made by banding together and making it right again. Human pride.”
“But what’s your plan? We’re risking our lives to get you South. When we get you there, what will you do to make me feel I risked my life for a good reason?”
“You already answered that. You’ve been risking your life for years, just trying to walk down the street. There is no God or Jesus or Vishnu or whomever who is going to lead us out of this wilderness. There’s just us. And there’s a lot of us, most of us, even, everywhere. Many ideas about the future. We’ll all figure it out, bit by bit. It will take generations, but there’s not time to waste.”
He could see that she wasn’t persuaded.
“You want me to tell you that if we do such and such, in a few years, this will all be over and life will be great?”
“That would be nice,” she said. “You think I’m stupid to want that?”
“To want that?” he said. “No, who wouldn’t want that? To believe that there’s a shortcut to that, that might be stupid. Your parent’s country, they fought for four or five generations just to get the right for a black person to sit next to a white person in public. We have a whole world to change.”
“What makes you think we’ll do better than my father’s country?”
“Actually, they took some of the first steps on the road we’re on, letting the old oppressors own up to their sins and then accepting them back into society. Take McDornish’s gang — say we kill all of them. But they have families, friends who then will hate us and we’ll never end that cycle of victor and vanquished. Most of them are no different than this lot — people with their backs up against it.”
“I’m not like them,” she said, her face cloudy with anger.
“No, you’re not,” he said. “Now. But like you said, they seemed righteous when they started. But they forgot something.”
“What?”
“That the point of fighting is not destroying your opponent. It’s changing what made you need to fight. It’s finding the connections that bind, not cleave.”
She didn’t answer. He could feel she was weighing it. She wouldn’t make up her mind just yet, but he had given her something to think about. He noticed the traffic in the other direction was starting to pick up. Their side was still nearly empty.
“Where are they all from?”
“Manchester,” she said. “Most are going as far south as they can, down toward Birmingham, hoping the Republic of South England will let them in. They’re betting the storm won’t get that far. This lot, they’re not betting on that. Maybe they were part of the Troubles, or what not. They’re heading to Hull, take the hover to Rotterdam or Bruges. We thought of that, but too many cops and soldiers. Even without you, the Urban Gypsies are unwelcome pretty much everywhere.”
He watched the cars creeping down the road. He noticed now they were all loaded up, things tied to the roof, trunks half open. After more than a thousand years, the Britons were reversing the voyages that brought them here. And what would they find in Europe? Safety or more frozen death?
“Do  children play the game of musical chairs here?”
“Yes,” she smiled. 
“Life cannot just be a game of musical chairs, don’t you think? People didn’t struggle for thousands of years to make a better life just to turn it into a game of winners and losers, more and more losing until there’s just a few places to sit.”
“But that’s human nature, isn’t it?”
“Ah, but which human nature? The human nature of the first people who figured out how to make a fire, or a bow and arrow, and showed everyone else how to do it, gladly and for free? Or the human nature of the drug corpos, who get uni students to discover life saving drugs for next to nothing, than want to patent them so only those who can pay can have it? What we call human nature isn’t really natural. You can’t find any other animals that are willing to kill half of their own kind.”
“So back to nature, is it? A dog’s life. I didn’t have you figured for a back to nature type. More like one of them teachers at the uni, what I heard.”
He smiled. “Maybe I think we should go forward to nature, not back. I just feel it in people, that they could live without fear and hatred and violence, we have it in us, but we’re trapped in dance we can’t figure out how to stop. I just want us to give it a go, to try, before we finally top ourselves as a species.”
“Yeah, okay, I can respect that. Still, you might need a hard girl like me along the way, right?” she said, grinning at him.
“Yeah, probably,” he laughed. “Then we’ll have to figure out how to soften you up.”</Text>

            <Title>The belly of the beast</Title>
            <Text>The belly of the beast
Raefe stood at the front of the ferry, watching Ilfracombe come closer. The rocky peninsula that rose 50 meters out of the ocean was a natural sea wall for the harbor, preserving the docks from flooding. Behind the docks, hills rose steeply into the North Devon countryside. After a week of traipsing around the North and Wales, he had made it to South England, Ltd. He felt a sense of excitement — he would be entering the belly of the beast, one of the largest and richest corporate states in the world.
He wandered down to the vehicle deck to find the car and Claire. She had stuck with him through the trip, his guide and protector. The blizzard had hit Newcastle only hours after they left and hadn’t stopped yet. She had become much quieter as the week wore on.
“Fancy a pint when we land?” he asked. “I figure you could use one.”
“If you’re buying, guv,” she said. “Want to keep my wits about me down here.”
“Fair enough,” he said. “I’d say knock off the ‘guv,’ but down here they’ll like that you say it.”
“Just a habit, really,” she said. “Been in the Urban Gypsies for years now, but them’s giving the orders, still’s the guv. And with all due, guv, you’re not just some office boss. We’ve all got a lot riding on what you’re up to.”
“Well, I’ll try not to disappoint.”
They had swapped Claire’s Northern Electric truck for one of Vietnam’s finest, a Peach three-wheeled fuel celler. With its plug-in conversion kit for rainy days and optional solar panels for sunny ones, it was probably the most popular car on the entire island of Britain.  And there’s was painted in  default Buddha Orange — their car would not give them away.
“I’ll connect my puter to the car so we know where we’re going,” Raefe said. Claire had used the onboard puter with the truck, but he suspected she was a typical Urban Gypsy when it came to being unable to afford net fees for her own puter. “Kayam, take us to the Tunnel Beaches.”
“Kayam?” Claire laughed. “Why’d you call it that?”
“Long story,” he said, watching the patchwork of lively streets and derelict neighborhoods out the window. “He was a guy I knew when I was a kid. Used to hang with my girlfriend at his coffee stand. He was an early fugee, he always wanted to know what the news was. I was always saying, ‘Computer, what happened in the Caliphate last night? Kayam wants to know.’ So when full AI interfaces came in a few years later, it was my own little joke to say ‘Kayam, what’s happening in the news.’
Claire pulled up in front of a tavern. The pub was vibrating with dark pulses at a fierce volume. Some pop star was on the vids wearing a rugby helmet with large horns, like some deranged Viking athlete.
“Just like my local,” Claire said. “Feel right at home here.”
“If you’re home is in an underground mine,” Raefe said. “You like this music?”
“Don’t tell me you’ve never heard Debris?” Claire said.
“That’s who this is?”
“Yeah. That’s him up on the vid wall — Johnny Debrise.”
Raefe switched his ‘puter to the vid channel. The host was attempting to interview Debrise.
“Johnny, we’re showing the fans an early picture of you and Black Mark Debree and Yellow Jay Debry. Tell us about it.”
“Not much to say, mate. We were kids with a passion for the music. Right place at the right time — end of the world and all that.”
“Our sponsors won’t like that Johnny — still so many things left to sell! But here’s something interesting I want to get your opinion on. We did a deep search and we can’t actually find any record of any of you before this picture. The whole Debris thing — is it all just a put on, Johnny? The Asian guy named Black Mark, the white guy Yellow Jay, and you, you might be mistaken for African. Take us back to when you were all born, the real people.”
“Born, you think we were born? Plenty of people been made in factories these days, don’t you know that?”
“Are you saying you’re a biohack, Johnny?”
“Not me, mate. Maybe you?”
“Nothing so exotic. So you weren’t born to a mother and you weren’t raised in glass dish. What then?”
“When them meteors crash into earth, new lifeforms arise. Just listen.”
He turned around and the band was behind them.He snapped his fingers and a deafening roar arose from the band, like boulders tumbling down a mountain.
“See, when the meteors crash into Earth, life arises from the Debris. That’s our life story.”
Claire was laughing heartily.”No one can play electric asteroid like Debris.”
“Thanks for cheering me up!” Raefe laughed, raising his beer in a mock toast to Debris.

“So you never finished telling me what ever happened to Kayam.” Claire said.
“Don’t know. It was turbulent times. We were all moving around. He and his partner, Kiko, they lost their stand to one of the first big coastal floods in the US that never receeded, back in 2048. We were all scattered to the winds.” He stopped, realizing he was talking about his first life. Every now and then, random memories from that past emerged as if they were part of this life. Shit, he hoped Claire wouldn’t go to the trouble of looking it up. Still only Lina knew about that, but he suspected the twins had figured it out. Not much got by them.
“How have you kept your wits about you through all of this?” Claire wondered. “I’m only 35 and it wears me down. And you’ve been fighting this fight almost as long as I’ve been alive.”
“No, I wasn’t conscious back then. Just a victim, like everyone else. Only we didn’t even know it back then. We were like drunks with a hangover — felt terrible but remembered the party from the night before. Still thought there would be more parties than hangovers. Have you been to Trafalgar or Picadilly in London?”
“Yeah, sure, back in the old UK days.”
“Even then, right, certain streets would have these massive streams of bicycles, motorbikes, three wheelers, taxis and the occasional big old auto. And if you had to cross, it was just bewildering. You wound up just wandering through it, trusting no one would hit you. Only that’s where the metaphor breaks down: no one was actually steering the ‘cars’ in life and you could get run over very easily. Just bad luck.”
“Is that why you got involved with the Free?”
“Yes and no. There was no Free yet. There were people like Goodstuff Benjamin, who started the New Voodo Army way back in the 2040s. Citizens of Nowhere goes back into the ‘30s. But I didn’t know about any of that. I was just a kid, a software grunt, and then I began to feel these connections to other people. Not in some poetic way, but real connections. I could feel people’s emotions, and that meant I knew who I could trust. And with fugees, that’s huge. Every fugee mistrusts everyone around them, and everywhere they go, everyone mistrusts them. And between the weather and the corpos, fugees were fast becoming the world’s leading product. And it was starting to get ugly — riots, killings, you know all of that. And I realized I had a chance to help stop it. Maybe even to find a way forward. Nothing else felt important at that point.”
This was the narrative he had crafted over the years to explain himself but also to hide his first life and the Guardians. In the old days, he and Lina had talked with Diver many times about that. She had strongly urged them to never reveal that, and they had acceded to her in that. In his heart, he still felt that humanity would be much better off knowing about the Guardians and the broad history of intelligent life in the Galaxy. But maybe it would be another thousand or two years before that would be truly helpful to human beings. He had to trust Diver on that.
“Fair weather on you for that, mate,” Claire said. “So where we headed in little Ilfracombe?”
“I’ve set up a meet with a contact who can help us evade the corpo police in the South. He’s got us meeting in an old changing house where there used to be a beach on a small inlet. There’s tunnels under the cliffs from the changing house to where the beach was — that’s all washed away now, but the tunnels are still there. Should be safe and quiet.”
“Had to give up the artillery when we ditched the truck, but I still got these,” she said, raising her hands in the air. “In case it’s not all sunshine.”
“If it’s going to go bad, it’s going to go bad and we’re just fucked. Besides, it would be better if he doesn’t see you. I’ll know if he’s with other people. If he’s alone, you can stand watch on the road. You’ve got your Voice?”
“Yeah, I’ll let you know if trouble’s coming.”</Text>

            <Text>How the other half lives
Liverpool, Republic of Northern England
November 1, 2081
Ganesh had insisted that they scope out the area before letting Raefe wander about. The big ferry to Dublin was Mersey-side at the new  terminal in Vauxhall. The solar-powered schooners were smaller and used what was left of the old docks in Bootle. The quayside was now only two meters above the waters, too close for the ferry but fine for smaller boats. There was a constant traffic on the water as boats came and went.
“Lot of ‘em used to be fishing boats,” Ganesh said. “Between overfishing and all the changes to the sea, not much left to catch. They ferry people around, all up and down the coast now. Too cloudy for solar cars here and most people can’t afford the fuel for long trips. A boat ride it is, then.”
They’d found a good vantage point up on Stanley Road and Ganesh was surveying both docks with binos. Claire had gone ahead to the meet point.
“I’m not seeing anything troubling,” Ganesh said. “Claire’s on my Voice saying ok on her end. You’re good to go, mate.”
 Raefe walked down the hill toward the old schooner docks. A handful of brighly colored sail boats were there, tourists milling about. Manfred had told Nyssa he would be at the Beatles &amp; Barbarians, a tourist trap of a pub that celebrated Liverpool’s two most famous musical alums, though neither the ancient rockers nor the currently huge Viking shredders had ever frequented the joint. Claire was in the back, pretending to smoke a hookah in between sips of a huge brown brew. He looked around. Manfred was at a table away from the window, sipping something clear.
“Manfred, good to see you,” Raefe said, shaking his hand. “I appreciate you putting yourself out like this.”
“Happy to help,” Manfred said. “You and Lina were always good to me.”
“Nice of you to say,” Raefe said. “I think maybe we were a little rough on you as a teenager.”
“Ah, fathers and daughters,” Manfred said. “I have an eight-year old girl now. I’ll probably be the same in a few years. No hard feelings. Anyway, this is all about much bigger things.”
That’s how they do it, Raefe thought. They think there are bigger things than children, because they only think of their child. They’ve lost the ability to think about all children, who will be all people.
“Not such big things, but yes, we have some serious matters to discuss. Myself and a companion need to be able to travel in South England for a few days, and then depart without being noticed. What do you advise?”
“Let me check the security situation.”
Manfred had certainly come up in the world, Raefe thought, from the ragged boy in the NVA settlement. He was wearing a slate blue onesie in some exotic technical fabric with short sleeves  and legs that stopped fashionably just below the calves. Did it have an integral puter? Raefe couldn’t see any ear—mounted eyepiece like everyone else used. 
“Your suit a puter too?” he asked.
“No,” Manfred said, embarassed. “UFS gives us implants. We subvoc to use it. Mandatory for employees above a certain rank.”
“Well, it was just a matter of time.”
“And money,” Manfred agreed. “Always that. Anyway, you’re a popular fellow these days. UFS security was alerted by Brightstar to be on the lookout, high priority. But UFS is still Euroish, and they’re not all that happy about Robertson. He’s allied himself with Warren, and UFS considers him a cave man with crackpot ideas. So I don’t think they’ll be torturing people to find you. But they will use all the normal means.”
Raefe was trying to decide if he was joking about the torture, but he couldn’t sense that. He’d been unpopular for years, but hurting people to find him? That was the stuff of local warlords, not global corpos. Then again, who did the local warlords work for?
“So in my opinion, London is still your best bet.” Manfred went on. “With 30 million people, they can’t watch everyone. Stay out of Central and The City — they’re closed off to anyone under Level 10 or their certified employees. Too difficult to make that work for you. South London’s your best bet, but it’s tricky. Barking’s all white, you could blend in there.”
“No, that won’t work for my friend.”
“Maybe Bromley then. Every sort there. Not dangerous, mostly Level 6ish. Low level managers, a few crafts types and so on. Can you fake that?”
“Water engineer? Software team leader? Teacher? That sort of thing”
“Teacher and engineer, no that’s Level 4 and 5 type stuff. A little downmarket. Is your companion female? She could be your wife, be an individual contributor. Especially if she’s younger. Team leader, that’s the right stuff.”
“Okay, I can still talk that talk.”
“Alright, you’re now Tom and Cecille Morgan and you’ve been transferred from Ilfracombe to the London offices of MiniWorlds, your old company from many years ago. You’ve been transferred a lot — check your new CV — so that should cover you if anyone asks did you know the Smiths and so on. Not unusual. You should find a housing complex for new arrivals — New Opportunity Housing is the official designation. Certain wags refer to it as NO Housing. All perfectly normal, as it can take a year or more to find permanent housing in London. All South England citizens have numbered identity accounts. I’ve emailed yours to the account you set up for us to communicate, along with your stage 1 password. That will work for most everything except direct contact with the state — they do DNA scans. It’ll take the week to set that up so that you can pass exit at Customs, so until then avoid being picked up by the coppers.”
“What else?”
“There’s no cash in South England, so you’ll have to use your puter to pay for everything. I’ve set up 5,000 credit accounts for both of you, but you can’t pay for anything over 500 credits without DNA authentication. In the countryside, that’s no problem. In Bromley, you’ll have to stick to the New Opps hotels near the train stations — you can find ones that cater to people not anxious to be found that will let you pay in advance each day to keep the total down. The area around the North Station in Bromley is best for that.”
“Just curious, but why would a Level 6 solid citizen not want to be found?”
“Nothing serious — late on paying the bills, that sort of thing.”
“And how confident are you that we’ll go undetected?”
“Quite. Without going into too much detail, the group I work in at UFS does this stuff routinely. It can all be traced back to my boss, but not me. It won’t be though — the security forces know not to poke into what UFS is doing.”
“Well, very much appreciated, Manfred.”
“Sure,” he said, his expression now pained. “Nyssa probably told you my situation. When I came here, I thought they would all be these bright shiney corpos who were going to rebuild the world and we’d all get rich doing it. They’re monsters, though. They wake up everyday trying to figure out how to make the most money off the end of civilization.”
“You know your masters don’t want to rebuild the world, right? They would be very happy ruling a world with only a billion people, if that’s what it came to.”
“I’m coming to that realization,” Manfred said, cringing at the word masters. “But I don’t see it changing. They have a lot of power and even more money.”
“Topic for another day. Don’t give up on Everywhere. They do want to rebuild the world, like you do. Just in a different way. So keep your eyes open, and thanks again.”
“Right,” Manfred said. “But before you go, there’s something you should know. It’s not just your lot that’s banding together. The big corpos like UFS had a meeting recently. Hush, hush, future of the world and all that. They have a plan. I don’t know what it is, but you should. It’s aimed at stopping your lot and who knows what else.”
“That’s interesting. We will do what we can. So what do I do now?”
“Oh, here. I have two return tickets on the boat for you. You’ll get off in Wales and here’s some train tickets to London. All as the Morgans.”
“Will I see you on the boat?”
“No, that wouldn’t do. I’ve got my own way of getting home. Not to worry. Hi to Nyssa — she was always smarter than me.”
He stood up, gave a little half salute and was gone. He waited and walked down the street to the boat. Claire came a few minutes later.
“I heard from Ganesh,” she said. “He spotted half a dozen mercs trying to look normal at the Dublin ferry dock.”
“My guy said Brightstar put UFS on to us. Still, we’ve got a way out,” he said, waving the tickets. “Mrs. Cecille Morgan, so nice to of you to accompany your husband Tom. Fancy a trip to Bromley?”
“Why, yes, Mr. Tom, I believe I do.”</Text>

            <Title>The Wall</Title>
            <Text>Building a wall 
Raefe longed to be back in Nigeria with Lina. The weeks of being on the run in the British Isles had been wearying. His tolerance for cold and damp, so finely honed by his New England childhood, had disappeared during the years in Africa. A year ago, a trip to  Dutch Island would have had him thinking of beaches and sunshine, but he wasn’t sure how the winds that now blew down from Greenland  had changed the Low Islands. Well, it was work, not pleasure, anyway that had him standing at the customs queue at Port Hague.
Bye, bye, Tom Morgan, he thought as he presented his Nigerian passport. Back to the more practiced and familiar Rando Millard, irrigation technology sales representative for Soltech. If they checked, he had entered Northern England under that name. That should be good enough, given that the Dutch, like everyone else, would have no luck making sense out of movement between the two halves of the former England. Neither government recognized the other, nor would cooperate in even the most basic international procedures like border control. So illegal crossings were routine and accepted by the rest of Europe as normal.
Work would resume tomorrow, but for now he could relax and get a feel for the place.  He checked into the local Globo, which still had desk clerks.
“I have some time this afternoon,” he said to Rudi, a tall young man with classic Dutch features and a South Asian complexion. “What do you recommend?”
“The weather is still nice. Have you seen the Great Wall of Holland?”
“No, haven’t been here since it was built. I thought it was just a great big pile of Earth.” He’d been about to say dirt but caught himself.
“Yes, but it’s nearly 50 meters wide at the top and people have set up all sorts of things up there. Plus the view is pretty cool. You can grab a bike outside, or maybe there are some of the autonomous skateways if you’re tired. Just like an old skateboard, but they move on their own. Just tell it ‘Great Wall’ and you’re all set.”
Worst of both worlds, Raefe, thought, a self-driving skateboard. No fun and no comfort. He opted for the bike. This part of Port Hague was mostly the old Den Haag and there were no large vehicles.  He enjoyed zipping through narrow streets, feeling the still warm breeze on his face. Apocalypse was at bay for a little while.
He hadn’t expected much from the Great Wall — it actually sounded vaguely ridiculous to him. But it took his breath away at first glance.  He had seen vids, but they did it no justice. The Wall was more like a cliff, rising nearly 30 meters and extending as far as the eye could see. It was still under construction. The landward side already extensive gardens that would have pleased a Babylonian emperor. Raefe knew the flowers were there to draw bees, who would then also pollinate many of the food crops being grown in steep terrace gardens. Nonetheless it was quite a beautiful touch to the plain Dutch city.
A series of escalators running parallel to the face of the wall brought you to the various garden levels, and eventually, to the top. He stepped off onto a wide, grassy boulevard filled with all sorts of food stalls, dancers, jugglers, street singers and a busy assortment of people. He wanted to explore it all, but first he had to look out seaward. Well-marked paths took him to the western edge, where he could see North Sea waves crashing 20 meters below. If not for the wall, the water would have overwhelmed everything behind him. Now, as far as he could see to either side, the coast of Holland looked life the cliffs of Dover, but for the corkscrew wind generators attached every 20 meters or so.
He walked for nearly an hour, absorbing the sights and smells of life on the wall. The sea air made him hungry. He decided to try the local specialty, herring with chili sauce and fries with curried mayonnaise, washed down with zoutbier. He loved the herring — the chili cut perfectly through the salt and musk of the small fish. The curried fries were an acquired taste. And the beer made him sad. Fresh water was too precious to waste on beer now, so the great Dutch brewers had set out to perfect genetically modified yeast that could make beer from salt water. It was barely drinkable and made him yearn for an old-fashioned Heineken. For that alone, the corpos should be made to pay.
He let his mind wander among the crowd along the Wall and he felt a quiet strength and something almost like happiness. He couldn’t find a waveform to entangle with. The Dutch had so far resisted that kind of bond, something he hoped to begin to change with his meeting with Leader de Gruen tomorrow. While their minds might be unreadable, they weren’t closed. And then he felt a mild energy, a slight mental itch, almost as if someone was trying to find him. 
He suddenly felt alone and exposed, here in a country where he knew no one and was unprepared for adversity. What an idiot he head been to allow himself the luxury of coming up here. This Wall was nothing more than a trap, 300 kilometers of nowhere to hide. All the exits he could reach could be easily watched, giving him nowhere to run either. He was about to reach out to Lina when a hand touched his shoulder from behind. He turned to face a young man.
“Raefe Miller?”
“No, I’m afraid you’re mistaken.” His mind raced, trying to buy time to decide what to do.
“Ah yes, Herr Millard. Not to worry — Leader de Gruen sent me to look after you. We should leave here now, you may not be safe.”
“Ok, what do I do?”
“Put these on.” He handed Raefe a Zon, the popular Dutch straw hat for sun protection and a pair of sunglasses.
“There, now you look like a local,” the man said. “Now we’ll walk up to escalator 14, which is the busiest on the wall. My name is Tygo, by the way.”
“Nice to meet you,” Raefe said, not meaning it all. He was rattled by how easily he had been found. “How did you find me?”
“I’ve been following you since you landed,” he said.
“You are very good at it,” Raefe said. “I never noticed you.”
“Just the point, eh,” Tygo said, smiling. “But I think you did, in a way.”
“That was you, that little tingle I felt in my mind?”
“Yes, I have a bit of the empath. I don’t need to see you to know where you are. But perhaps you have also felt one or two people who are looking for you, who are not so friendly?”
“Truthfully, no. I guess the world is catching up to me — outside of Nigeria, I’m so used to being the rare empath. I often sit in parks and let my mind wander outwards. I don’t usually find anyone who’s aware of me. On some level, I’ve been waiting for this day, with some dread. Turnabout is fair play, I suppose.”
“Fair play is not what is at stake, though, is it?” Tygo said. “I can teach you how to evade me later, but for now, we should go.”
“Lead on.”
He followed the Dutchmen through a mystifyingly innocuous yet purposeful series of turns and stops. Tygo urged silence, answering none of Raefe’s questions, whether spoken or thought. They were almost at the escalator when Raefe felt a sudden spike of anger wash over him from somewhere off to the left. He looked quickly in that direction, but could see nothing. He felt Tygo’s hand on his shoulder, and turned to see him shaking his head “no,” and felt the Dutchmen’s hand gently pushing him toward the escalator.
They descended in silence. Raefe started toward his bicycle but again Tygo shook his head.
“It is a public bike — let’s leave it here and travel in more comfort,” Tygo said, pointing toward a small solar three wheeler. So the stern bodyguard had a sense of humor after all, Raefe thought. They nestled into the tiny vehicle and told it to go to the Globo.
“Can we talk in here?” Raefe asked.
“Yes, we are safe now from prying minds and ears,” he answered.
“How much danger were we in?” Raefe asked. “I thought I felt someone angry and frustrated near the escalator.”
“Quite so, but he wasn’t alone. I believe there were three men and two women up there looking for you,” Tygo said. “They seemed to not know where you were in Den Haag, and were up there on the assumption that you might visit. So now I think we have left them behind and they are none the wiser.”
“I can’t believe that I didn’t sense them. I must be getting old!”
“No, but perhaps you are not practiced at deception. It goes against your beliefs about empathy.”
Raefe felt slightly sick. Empathic deception — what did that even mean? He would very much have to look into this.
“We are at your hotel. Tomorrow, then. You are with Herr deGruen at 11. I will come at nine and we will spend some time teaching you to hide in plain thought, as it were.”</Text>

“Do you remember sitting here 50 years ago, when we began our project of reforming the Guardians,” Hanikori asked.
“I do,” Green said, “while we sipped bitter tea. And worried that Far Flier would find out.”
“You were worried about him?”
“Weren’t you? He embodied the Guardians back then.”
“And then he didn’t,” Hanikori reminded him.
“He seems to have removed himself from the Guardian waveform. Not just the Council, but the whole organization. It’s been years since I felt his signature in the waveform.”
“Yes, his vaunted dedication seemed to decline rapidly once he lost control of the organization,” Hanikori said. “Just as well. He would only have been a hindrance these past years. Speaking of which, I have some ideas I want to bring up at the next Guardian Council. I wanted to get your reaction first, though.”
“I’m all ears.”
“I’ve been thinking for some time that our organizational structure is outmoded and needs reform. Two of the five directorates — Timelines and Ambassadors — are centered around actively managing emergent species. Given that we have a tepid project on Earth and no other ones in sight, it seems like overkill.”
“Well, there’s always the possibility of future discoveries,” Green said guardedly, wondering whether he was about to be fired as head of Timelines.
“Yes, yes, the future,” Hanikori said. “That’s what I’m concerned about. I think that we have to rethink this whole Guardianship project in light of our own vision for the future, don’t you agree?”
“Say more,” Green said, not sure about whether he was part of the “our” in “our vision.”
“To be blunt, the success of the e21 project will be the death of Guardianship,” Hanikori said. “Technically, sure, we could carry on. But we will be consumed by exploring our own new abilities. And yet we have these projects like Earth and we will want to fulfill our responsibilities in some way.”
“I suppose you’re right. I mean, why would we transform unless it brought us a whole new way to be? Simply living forever isn’t that attractive unless it brings the prospect of new modes of existence. What do you propose?”
“That we combine the directorates under your leadership, and we redefine their mission.”
“To be…”
“To be one of active stewardship,” said Hanikori, “not passive monitoring. If your department was focused on finding the timelines where we could be most effective, we could also periodically nudge civilizations through occasional gifts of technology and knowledge.”
“You want to remove the ban on active interference from our activities? Do you think the council will go for that?”
“Yes, with your support and Putnomo’s, we’ll have the vote. He’s already on onboard.”
“Well, you know you have my support. But what about the Ambassadors? And Earth?”
Hanikori smiled. “Dear old Earth. The 20 most advanced civilizations in the Galaxy have spent the last 150 years worrying about that odd little lot. Quite remarkable.”
“They’ve felt like that one little child in the nursery who just won’t learn their lessons.”
“Well, you have more experience with children than me, but that seems apt,” Hanikori said with a hint of the distaste that the subject of procreation usually brought to him.
“Do you see just cutting off the whole project?”
“No, no,” Hanikori said. “We owe them something, I feel. We’ve mucked about in their affairs on and off, probably done more harm than good. But we can bring it to a successful conclusion.”
Green was intrigued by Hanikori’s oblique reference to his failures on Earth. “Are they a difficult people, is that it? Did you find them that way?”
“Me? No, not at all,” Hanikori said as if surprised. “I was thinking of the mess Diver made. But I think we have some things in place, and some hidden reserves.”
“Oh?”
“Well, first there’s Adno, the fish who took Diver’s place.”
Green was slightly taken aback at “fish.” Adno was from a race every bit as intelligent as theirs. “Fish” was what they ate for dinner. “How do you mean?”
“Adno’s people are water dwellers. They exist as schools. Humans live on land, they exist as individuals in very loose and conflicting groups. She is, if you will pardon the pun, out of her depth with them,” Hanikori said, laughing at his own joke.
“Funny,” Green smiled back. “So you’re suggesting that if I leave her alone, the whole thing will eventually just, as it were, fall into the ocean?”
“Undoubtedly,” Hanikori said. “But that is not actually what I was thinking. We should lead by example, don’t you think? If we can bring the Earth project to a quick and successful conclusion, we will silence lingering doubts among the Guardians.”
“And your plan for that is?”
“Contrary to popular belief, I did not spend my time as ambassador to Earth wandering around in ignorance. I admit that the Korean initiative backfired badly. But I put in place initiatives that are just now bearing fruit.”
Green stared at him for a moment, contemplating the notion that Hanikori had been secretly involved somehow in Earth for over 100 years. Every time he wanted to trust the man, something like this caused him the deepest of doubts.
“You are troubled,” Hanikori said. “You think it was wrong of me to do this on my own. But I have always been clear that leaders must lead, from wherever they can. This is not about me. I turn this over to you with no reservation.”
“And what is it you want me to do?”
“You will sense in my mind a number of different numbers. You will also sense some other data. The numbers you will recognize as coordinates, but they are encrpyted. If you think of the data and the numbers together, the actual coordinates will resolve. Only you can do that — certain aspects of your brain waves that are unique to you form a private key. Anyway, if you go to that location, you will find all the information you will need to carry on.”
What more secrets does this man hide, thought Green. He would have to find that out. For now, he was very curious about what Hanikori had in mind for Earth.</Text>

Diver loved sitting on this rock after fishing. She had her own name for it — Hawk’s Perch — but she knew Far Flier would think it sentimental and silly, so it remained her private name for it. Whatever he might think, it was a good name for this solitary rock, standing 20 meters high just off the beach. From the top, she could see the silver flash of bait fish far out into the water, the ripples where blue trout disturbed those schools, and the swells of Adno’s people as they herded the blue trout into the shallows, where they could feast on them as needed.
She had her own ways of hunting the blue trout, flying above them and grasping them in her enhanced claws or even her mouth. They had lived for millions of years without fear from the skies, so they rarely looked up. This morning’s harvest had filled her basket, which  held two days food for them. She could relax and let Water Eye’s warm rays dry her. This world’s star was larger and brighter than A’Nonto’s but it was alone in the day sky. After 30 years, she was finally getting used to the simple, repetitive cycle of day and night. There was something clean and direct about this diurnal existence, but she sometimes missed the more varied kinds of light that the dance of Mother,  the two Fathers and the Twins had brought to the world she had been born and spent her first 450 years on.
She had been surprised at how hard it had been to accommodate to this new place. Her mind had traveled so many places through the wormhole interface network, she hadn’t understood that it would be different to stand on a different piece of rock, with a different sky. But she shuddered to think about what would have happened had she and Far Flier not taken their child and disappeared, avoiding Hanikori’s sharp beak, at least figuratively. Antithikos was very young when they had come here, and he took to it well enough. When he was hungry, when he wanted to sleep, to be most active — these became the new rhythms of their life. When she and Far Flier had bred Marilon, they spent much time in the water. 
After she was born, Mari took to the water like an alaktar, the water birds of their home world. Even her enhancements adapted themselves to be as adept on the surface and under the water as on land. For Far Flier and her, it was a pleasant and surprising reminder of just how flexible life can be, a message they had perhaps needed in their sometimes lonely exile. As she trudged up the hill to their home with her basket of fish, she felt her family’s minds begin to brush hers. Long ago, she had glimpsed an image in one of the human’s minds — was it Raefe or Lina — from an Earth story about someone living all alone in a forest who kept a candle in the window in case strangers were looking for warmth in the cold nights of their winter. That’s what her brood’s minds felt like just now.
“You’ve been fishing,” Anti greeted her. “My fierce mother.”
“Fierce?” she protested. “So you only want to eat leaves now?”
“Why don’t you let Adno’s school bring us fish?” Mari asked. “It’s nothing for them.”
“I do,” she said. “I let them bring us things from the deeps and from the bottom, things we cannot get for ourselves. I like fishing.”
“We should teach our children to hunt, don’t you think,” Far Flier said, laughing at the whole familiar conversation. “What kind of A’Mopto is it who must ask fish to feed them?”
“The kind who lives on the world of the fish,” Anti shot back, who was always embarrassed at his parents insistence on maintaining their old rituals from their old home, a home fading from his memory and never seen by his sister.
“If that bastard Hantikori falls in a volcano someday, we should take a chance on you both joining the waveform back there,” Diver said. “I love this world, and I’m so grateful for Adno and her school to take us in, but I worry that you don’t get to feel so many of the joys we had growing up on A’Nonto.”
“Wouldn’t that be nice,” Far Flier agreed, knowing it was better to agree with her than remind her how unlikely that was. “But the children and I have been talking with Adno and she brings news from the Guardians.”
“Oh,” Diver replied. “Good or bad?”
“Well, likely bad,” Far Flier said. “Hantikori is re-organizing the Council. She’s not clear what it all means, except that it seems to mean that the Council will both look less for new contacts and be more intrusive with the ones they have.”
“Intrusive,” she said with some alarm. “In what way?”
“Unknown,” he said. “But he’s brought back the old ideas of more direct intervention. Maybe even technology transfers.”
“He’s a madman,” Diver said. “Every 10,000 years or so, some madman like him steers the Guardians in that direction and it never ends well.”
“Much worse, actually, than you may know,” Far Flier said. “In the distant past, some of these misguided leaders actually brought about the destruction of entire species due to their meddling.”
“Oh, Far Flier, I can’t bear it. Stuck hear on this island, cut off from the waveform, watching your life’s work, and what was to be mine, dissolved in an acid of egotism and foolishness. Even after these eons of learning and peace, to know that this can still happen.”
“Wisdom is no more solid than this island,” he said. “Battered by waves of all sorts. But you know that. I sense that something more specific is bothering you.”
“Walking up the hill, I remembered a little story from Raefe’s mind. I miss the humans, I miss the freshness and boldness of their struggles. We have so much built up knowledge and technology and the help of 20 other races to guide us. They have none of that, yet they are so firm in fighting for their own future. Even when they are wrong, their passion wins my heart. I can’t bear to think of what will happen to them if Hanikori and his foolish little clique meddle in their world.”
“We’ll have to trust that Adno can prevent that,” he said, but she could see in his eyes that he was worried as well.

            <Text>Island life
Jan de Gruen was the first Leader of the Dutch Island Republic. His title set him apart from the 1,000 Delegates and the 50 Councillors who formed the political government of the new nation, but he was as much a follower of the Delegates and Councillors as their Leader. Raefe was comforted to feel that he was internally strong but also comfortable, not looking to establish dominance in their dealings.
“Welcome, Herr Miller,” de Gruen said. “I understand you had a close call on the Wall yesterday?”
“So I’m told. Your man Tygo was a bit mysterious about it all. But efficient. I did sense one or two people in the crowd near the escalator who were hostile, although I could not locate them.”
“Ah, the famous empath in action. Very good, by the way.”
“Your man was much better at it. I have a lot to learn from him. That surprised me, I have to admit. I generally think of your country as uninterested in entangling.”
“But always interested in engaging with other people on their own terms,” DeGruen said. “But seriously, our surveillance bots identified two women who we know to be corpo agents at that location. Do you recognize them?”
Two faces appeared on the wall, common Euro Asian appearance.
“Never seen them. Noticed you’re not wearing a puter. You’ve been modded?”
De Gruen winced. “I just think of it as an implant. Still the same me, otherwise.”
“Interesting. You’re the first person outside of fairly high level corpos who I’ve met with that.”
“Well, you have your empathy, we have our circuitry.”
“I wish it were that simple. But before we get into that, what do you think these agents were up to?”
“We’re not sure. We know they work for Philips DeMag. The corpos are quite disturbed about our meeting. They have inside sources and they have some idea about what we’re going to discuss.”
“I’ve been discussing active empathic skills training around the world for decades. The corpos don’t like it, but why the sudden panic?”
De Gruen smiled. “With all due respect to your talents and vision, we also have some ideas that could really shake up the whole world, right now.”
“I’m all ears.”
“Many people involved in the whole Dutch Republic project have turned their minds to what’s next now that the Wall has us safe from the sea, at least for this century. If the snows come, we’ll have more challenges, but for now, we are safe. But the whole Wall project was very revealing to many Dutch people.”
“In what way?
“It made them think about territory. The Netherlands were a nation that was always growing, but only slightly, larger — reclaiming land from the sea, building walls and dikes. We maintained a balance between people and land. Now our land is shrinking.”
“Partly your choice, don’t you think? Building the Dutch Channel between yourself and Philips Free State — what did you expect?”
“Just so. Most of our citizens call it Philips Not So Free State, and they were happy to put a mile of sea water between us. And now, What can we do? Stop letting people in? Throw some people out? Mandate a one child, or no child, policy, as China disastrously did generations ago? None of these appeal to our citizens, yet here we are.”
“I don’t need to sense your thoughts to know you have arrived at a plan. What is it?”
“The world is full of a growing number of stateless people. You’ve seen the “1B” logos on clothes everywhere. More than a billion people have left not just their home, but their countries, in the last five years, driven by flood, lack of water, corporate tyranny, and good old-fashioned dictatorial government, ethnic and religious strife, and a long list of other things. It’ll be two billion before long. What will become of these people, with no state to defend them?”
“Obviously you know of my work with Nowhere. They grew out of exactly this problem, during the many years of conflict in  Africa. Now millions of Africans are Citizens of Nowhere.”
“Yes, we have followed your work with Lina Kawambai Yang over the last three decades quite closely. When the NVA and Nowhere joined forces in 2055, you created a brilliant solution for many Africans. Their societies’ development was gutted. It seemed like every time they came close to reversing the effects of colonialism, they faced an equal challenge from corporate invaders, local despots, climate change and ongoing civil strife. Your combination of effective technology and new arrangements for governance really cut through all of that. But I think you’d admit that the Free Alliance you’ve tried to build on top of that around the world is going slowly.”
“You’re right about that. We continue to try new things. Do you have some thoughts on the Free Alliance?”
“Living in the heart of Europe, with UFS a boat ride away, Philips a kayak ride away, and several other global corpo powers a train ride away, we are  keenly aware that the corpos believe the world has reached a tipping point. Governments are weak enough, and the corpos are strong enough, to reverse the power relationship.”
“You mean they want to put a bullet in the head of the governments they’ve spent two centuries bullying and controlling.”
“Something like that. We think they will make a move soon.”
“You’re referring to the summit in Lausanne next month?”
“Very impressive, Herr Miller. Few people know of it.”
“Do you know what they have planned?”
“Not precisely. But in broad terms, we expect them to divide the world into territories, rather like a corporate salesforce has, and each of the major corpos is expected to control those territories. Their goal is just to maximize profit. They’ll allow civil governments to continue collecting the garbage and so on, but no decisions with significant  impact on either the corpos or their leadership corps will be taken without their approval. Profit is their main concern — petty issues like morality will be left to those who have such ethereal concerns.”
“The fools. After what they’ve done to the world for 200 years, they shouldn’t be able to get a job as a data clerk, let alone running the world. They’ll make a hash of it.”
“Quite. More to the point, they’ll make more of a hash of our world. Conceivably, they could push the warming past merely hostile into uninhabitable. Their inability to sacrifice short-term gain for long-term benefits suggests, in fact, that the most likely outcome of another 200 years of corpo rule will be the end of Earth as broadly habitable. Not that the most powerful of them will suffer. They are already exploring underground living in Dubai, and soon we’ll hear about their plans for space villages.”
“But, let’s be honest, Herr de Gruen, they’ve been headed this way for a long time. And you still haven’t told me what your plan is.”
“It’s Pietr, by the way. Our plan is very simple. The Dutch Republic is going to announce in a month’s time that it will become the first global nation. Any person in the world can become a citizen of the Dutch Republic. We ask only that you pay us a tax of 10% of your income above 100,000 euros. In exchange, you will receive a passport from us and one vote. We will guarantee you basic social benefits — unemployment insurance, health insurance and old-age benefits — and represent you in legal disputes with the corpos and other governments. Only humans can be citizens — no corporations,  or animal surrogates for them, no computers.”
“Very interesting. And how do you think the Free Alliance fits into this?”
“The forces allied with you are natural allies for us. We want to work together. Many things are on the table — dual citizenship for Nowhere, strategic alliances. We know you have contacts with other emerging forces around the world in the Free Alliance. The Global Republic of Holland is just a beginning. Where can we go together?”
“That is something I will be happy to discuss with Nowhere’s governing council, and others in the Free Alliance.  Perhaps the question should be how can we do things that no country has ever done? How can we break down the social divisions that make war, famine, and social dominance by certain groups possible, even inevitable?”
“And we are attracted by your vision in those areas. So let us begin the discussion.”

Marilon found the blue trout just beyond the reef. Their thoughts were very rudimentary, but Adno had taught her to recognize them. The blue trout had a deep fear of the Reef Gardners — what Adno’s kind called themselves — and they always maintained an awareness of where to avoid them.
Today, the trout were relaxed. The Reef Gardners were neither on the reef nor gardening. They had gone deep, off the shelf, looking for the shellfish who lived near the sulfur and phosphorous vents. Every so often, they hunted them for the minerals that their bodies required. Marilon floated to the surface and let Water Eye dry her. She re-adjusted her enhancements, extending the webs between her toes and fingers, and allowing her feathers to regenerate on her arms. The whole process took about five minutes, by which time she was mostly dry.
She flapped her arms hard enough to raise her up on her feet on the water. She let her webbed feet catch the water as she zipped quickly along the surface. In a single fluid motion as she ran, she raised her arms just over her shoulders, and then thrust downward mightily, and tucked her feet under her. She was airborne now and quickly found the wind that circled upward from the water toward the sun. She headed toward where the trout had pointed to Adno’s school.
A few minutes later, she could see them below the water, their silver blue bodies reflecting the sun back. Her mother often reminisced about the beautiful green and black of the fish on their old world. Fish with shiny backs had long ago been consumed by her kind, leaving only the dark-backed behind. But flyers had never evolved on this world, where 95% of the surface was water. Near the surface, there was nothing larger or more dangerous than the  three-meter-long Reef Gardners, so they put on a brilliant underwater show for Marilon in the bright sun.
Marilon slipped into the school’s waveform as she circled down to the surface. She was far from their little island now, truly alone on the surface of the great sea.
“Mari who sits on the water,” Adno’s thoughts reached out to her. “The Reef Gardners invite you to add your darkness to our light.”
“Many thanks,” she responded. “But I come to seek your wisdom, Guardian Ambassador.”
“Then join me and we will let the warm river take us to quiet waters,” Adno replied.
Marilon shifted her enhancements again, slimming her wings and activating her underwater breathing capabilities. Her eyes shifted slightly toward the infrared. She could see the school below. She dove under, heading for the warm current rising from an ocean floor vent that Adno had mentioned. Quick as a flash, Adno was along side of her, nuzzling her with her snout.
“You are far from home,” Adno said. “I sense that you are troubled.”
“Far Flier says that there is trouble with the Guardians. He worries about Earth. Should I be worried?”
Adno circled, her dorsal fin shaking slightly in the way she showed uncertainty or unease.
“I wish I knew, little water bird. The older ones on the Council have changed things, for the better they say. Since your mother left, I have tried my best, but Earth is my first assignment as Ambassador. Tanoch has helped me, and I feel that I have helped Raefe and Lina in various ways. But now Tanoch has left the Council and never joins the waveform from his home planet anymore. Green — he is your kind — thinks soothing thoughts when we entangle, but he seems more interested in pleasing Hanikori than anything else. And that man makes me feel that somewhere  in the cold water below, a big predator is watching me.”
“The humans have a saying about people like him — he’s a snake.”
“A snake?”
“Yes, they are the land equivalent of a kanna eel. Like the kanna hides in the reef, and then darts out and poisons you, the snake hides in the grass or rocks on land and also has a poisonous bite.”
“Well, that snake has a very big head and he doesn’t hide much. Since your father left, he has changed everything. Still, I don’t think he’s done and now that I think of it, you’re right. He hides many things, including what the future holds for Earth.”
“My parents don’t know that Anti and I have joined with Des and Nyssa through the waveform. I don’t think Raefe and Lina know either. But I can’t bear to think of something bad happening to all of them.”
“Young one, your parents are not so old that they would not understand your affection for the humans. But that is for you to tell them, not me. I will keep you informed.”
“Maybe we should do more than that, Adno. You’re on you’re own on the Council. You have to stay there so we know what’s happening. But you may have to keep quiet to do that.”
“What are you saying?”
“That Anti and I can be your surrogate. All three of us can figure it out. Green never has to know. You can play along with him, keep him in the dark.”
“You are asking me to betray the Guardian Council.”
“I think Far Flier would say you would be acting as a true Guardian.”
“I have to think about that, Mari. But I will keep it between us.”
“Thanks, Adno. I’m going to the surface to dry off now, so I can fly home.”
“Fly well, bird whose feathers are not always the color they seem.”
That night, in the faint gray orange that was night on Water Eye, she found an excuse for Anti and her to go for a walk. Once out of her parents’ sight, they walked down the narrow trail that led to a small cave. As small children, they had found this cave and it had become their secret place, almost the only place that on their little island that their parents couldn’t see them.
Once inside, she told Anti about her conversation with Adno.
“What are you worried about?” Anti asked. “I mean, specifically, what do you think the Guardians would do to mess up Earth?”
“You know that both mom and dad think that ‘Kori is a psycho, right? That when he was Earth Ambassador, some pretty weird shit happened on the planet.”
“True. I see your point. We have to tell Des and Nyssa, don’t you think?”
“I do,” Mari said. “I think, in fact, that the four of us have to be prepared to step in. No one on the Council knows about us. They probably don’t think too much about Des and Nyssa. All of us live to be thousands of years old, so it’s only natural that they think of Des and Nyssa as little more than newborns. And even mom and dad don’t know that I was part of the Reef Gardner waveform, and our family’s, before I was born. And that after I learned how to modify my enhancements, I taught you. So we have abilities that are new, maybe, even to the Guardians.”
“I see your point. For now, let’s not freak Des and Nyssa out too much. Let’s just introduce the idea that we’re all going to pay attention to anything unusual, anything on Earth that smells like Guardian.”</Text>

            <Text>High level meetings
Billy Warren could never get used to the Swiss. They took an inordinate pride in being small and disconnected from everything around them. Their happiest moments seemed to be when you handed them money — plastic, cash or check, it didn’t matter — but they had little ambition to do anything with it except accumulate it. Not that he didn’t understand that impulse, but where was their creative spirit? Where were the buildings, the inventions, the accomplishments that said “I made this and it changed everything?” Still making mechanical watches — that was their idea of ingenuity.
Still, it had a harsh beauty, this place. Looking over Lake Geneva at sunset, the view was gorgeous, if empty. No boats and certainly no swimmers marred it’s surface. The mountains of the southern shore were reflected in almost perfect fidelity on it’s cold, still surface. The storms that had brought the northern British Isles to their knees had still had enough in them to whiten the tops of the high Alps, glistening in the distance. If you wanted to, you could think of them as new glaciers. 
The fate of the glaciers was not his concern. They had come, they had gone, life would go on. And someone would have to be at the top of that pile of life. That was a struggle he understood, relished.
“You are ready, I see.”
“Indeed,” he thought. “We have a strong hand in the negotiations. Any poker player will tell you, the best cards bring the best luck.”
He had gotten used to these dialogs with the voice who called himself Hank. At first, he thought he might be going crazy. But over time, Hank had definitely given him insights and information that he could never know on his own. Maybe he was some kind of super-smart hacker.
“Who do you fear the most at these talks?” Hank asked.
“Fear? I don’t really fear any of them. We’re all basically on the same side. But if you mean, who’s most likely to oppose me, it’s the Euros, hands down. They still think we can make some kind of grand deal, some kind of hybrid between old-fashioned governments and corporate states. They’re always going on about how they pioneered that idea back in the 20th century.”
“It didn’t work then either. All it did was submerge the elite in a morass of mediocrity,” Hank said. “Held humanity back.”
“Try telling them that.”
“No, no point, I agree,” Hank replied. “But I think we have some aces up our sleeves.”
And before Billy could ask what, Hank did one of those fire-hose brain fills he sometimes did. Billy’s mind was flooded with new knowledge, new possibilities and he understood then how he would win the day in the negotiations. Hank had given him a hand full of aces — no one could top them. He walked back to his room and watched a vid. By 11 he was sleeping like a baby.
In the morning, they all gathered on the far terrace, the sun now just peeking over the distant mountains. They had rented the hotel in its entirety. No tourists, travelling salesmen or prying journalists. Just the 14 most powerful business men and women in the world.
Billy looked around at the group. There was Alden Hayashi, who commanded a powerful set of Pacific Rim financial services firms that was the only realistic counterweight to the Chinese government in the region. From the Americas, Mariana Munoz had amassed a fortune in financial services and privatized governmental services throughout the US, Canada, Mexico and the smaller Central American countries. Ken Robertson, whose DigiBrands represented a century of mergers between ancient tech giants like Apple and Microsoft and a host of consumer products and communications companies. Ilana Romero ran Brazil’s PetroBras empire — one of his main competitors in the resource industries — but also a string of South American telecommunications and biotech manufacturing companies.
The Euros had a committee of five men and women, a mix of old and new money, that were backed by Daimler Siemens, Philips DeMag, Fiat, and several other large Euro conglomerates. Wang Ya Chen presided over China’s giant mining, manufacturing and electronics concerns. Adnan Arjan led over 1,000 companies that dominated the Indian subcontinent, as well as parts of the Middle East and East Africa. Prince Ibn bin Ibn held the keys to the Saudi royal treasury, which had managed to survive the decline of oil and now had its fingers in many pies throughout the Middle East, Africa and around the world. And Susan Mbuto owned many different businesses throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
“Ladies and gentlemen, let’s get started,” Billy said. “No need for introductions, you all know each other. Was a time we’d meet like this alongside a bunch of civic leaders, intellectuals and so on over at Davos. Talk about the future and all that. But we all know why we are here to day: the seas are taking our territories and we face significant challenges to our authority. But who else can marshal the resources to solve these problems? Alden is going to start the discussion off.”
“Thanks, Billy. As leaders of various corporate states, we’ve all been faced with multiple challenges. Governments and citizen groups are now mounting what I believe is our most serious challenge — alternative citizenship that promises them both material benefits and a sense of belonging? I put to you that we have to compete on that playing field, and I have a proposal that does just that.”
The room was silent for a minute as their implants processed his proposal.
“I think this is brilliant, Alden,” said Ken Rosenberg. “Liberty, the first global corporate state for members only!”
“Thanks, Ken,” Alden replied. “You will all note that Liberty is specifically designed to cripple our opponents’ funding. Citizens of Liberty must pledge not to pay taxes to any other entity.”
“Your proposal indicates that Liberty’s governance will be by executive committee of this body as founders,” Gerhard Freundlich said. “No messy, ultra-democratic parliament. So it differs from Holland in that way. But how does it differ as far as benefits to its citizens go?”
“It’s a totally different beast,” Alden said. “It’s clear from the start that Liberty will protect private property and not interfere with personal freedoms. But it also not be a welfare state. Citizens will have to provide for themselves, but they won’t have to provide for large numbers of unproductive people. It’s a nation of doers.”
“I’m not sure that makes it competitive with Holland,” Freundlich replied. “And in some ways, it sounds like another Citizens of Nowhere, just with an annual membership fee. They have neither that nor taxes.”
“Property, Gerhard.” Billy said. “We protect their property. We will be the last great protection for those who have bothered to accummulate property. Don’t you think the world’s property owners will welcome the chance to right the ship and stop the never-ending assault on their rights? Surely, they’ll see that’s the only way to continue to grow as a society, to restore the profit motive to some place of pride?”
“Mr. Warren, if I may, only recently the most profitable part of the Dutch Republic dug a canal to separate itself from the Philips DeMag Corporate State, the largest employer in Holland, and declared itself independent. These sorts of fractures will become more common, until our societies are so highly fragmented that they will cease to exist. So no, our eyes are right now not on re-writing the past, but on saving the future.”
“Mr. Freundlich has a point,” Adnan Arjan said. “We are putting this approahc into what is basically a hostile environment. We won’t win everyone over. There will be multiple futures out there for the taking for some time.”
“We don’t have that kind of luxury,” Wang Ya Chen said. “We’re looking at massive relocations from our most developed, populous areas. That will not happen easily or peacefully.”
“Let’s not get carried away,” Warren said. “We’re not here to solve the entire world’s problems — just ours. Liberty is designed to staunch the wound while we prepare the second phase.”
“Right,” Alden said. “If you look past the first five to ten years of the plan, you’ll see that we anticipate only partial success. We expect that we will recruit several hundred million of the world’s wealthiest people to Liberty.  That will give us a legitimacy and power to fend off local opposition for some time. As of now, there is no coordinated international opposition, just the Free Alliance, which shows no indication that it can oppose us in a forceful manner.”
“And when they do?” asked Illana Romero. “Because in South America, we fully expect the Free Alliance to challenge us.”
“Well, we haven’t completed the Phase 2 plan yet, but the outlines are simple,” Alden said. “We divert some of the revenue we collect from citizens to build self-sustaining, underground communities in secret. Once we’ve gotten about 50% of the way with that, we accelerate that by threatening to disrupt the key goods and services our businesses provide outside the corporate states if governments and other entities don’t pay us higher fees.”
“And when they stop paying?” Romero asked.
“Look, we can play Ouija here all day,” Warren interjected. “Long story short — the wealthiest people in the world are going to build themselves private underground luxury cities and disappear while the rest of humanity tears itself apart fighting over a shrinking pie. After a century or so, we’ll resurface and the whole world will be Liberty.”
“And who will do all of this?” Freundlich asked. “Who will build these cities, keep them running? Where will all those laborers come from?”
“That’s easy,” Rosenberg said. “They’ll come from my factories and yours. At long last, we’ll have a world where robots do all the work. We’ll cut deals with engineering talent to let them work off their membership fees so that we can continue to develop the software, but other than that, it’ll be robots making robots to do what we need them to do.”
“But what if humanity hangs on?” Freundlich asked. “What if after a few generations, sure many have died, but many remain and are not willing to give up?”
“This wasn’t in the materials sent to you,” Warren said. “But time is on our side. We have some very special benefits to offer those who can bring large resource pools to the table. We’ve been working with some amazing scientists who can make being a Liberty citizen a very long-lived proposition for those who merit it. And that will guarantee a stable core of like-minded people who can guide Liberty through the difficult times ahead. In short, we can live for centuries, even millenia, while nature takes its course.”</Text>

“Can you believe this?” Antithikos said, his thoughts tinged with anger. “This Hantikori is really just too much.”
“This is outrageous, for sure,” Des replied. “But being on the exact planet that he seems to be trying to manipulate, I’m worried about what we can do to prevent this from happening.”
“We have to tell Raefe and Lina,” Nyssa said.
“Can you do that without getting into how the four of us learned this?” Marilon asked. “Or are we ready to let them know that we can entangle with each other from Water Eye to Earth without the Guardian wormhole network? And that we could entangle with the people in that room without them knowing it?”
“Mom and Dad already know that there’s something extra in how me and Des communicate,” Nyssa said.
“They do?” Des asked. “When did that happen?”
“Just recently I told them that we can tell when they entangle. I told them it’s one of those twin things. I joined in one of their ‘conference calls’ and just let it drop. Sorry, I should have told you.”
“We’ve kept it all from our parents,” Marilon said. “They haven’t even quite figured out that Adno entangles with her school in quite a different way than with Mom and Dad. Far Flier will never get his head around it, I’m afraid. Mom will though — she’s always been in touch her ‘bird’ side, she likes the different feeling she gets from it.”
“Let’s keep the big picture in mind here,” Antithikos said. “The head of the Guardian Council has deceived one of the most powerful human beings, who now thinks he has some kind of imaginary friend named Hank. And Hank has manipulated Billy Warren into creating an alliance of his fellow oligarchs by promising them the technology to live hundreds of years and to do it in secret underground, self-sufficient settlements while the humans above destroy the environment and themselves. We can’t allow that to happen! This is exactly what drove my parents off our home world. Mari, I know you think Far Flier’s a funny old man, but he’s fought for centuries to keep stuff like this from happening.”
“You’re right, Anti,” she said. “Des, Nyssa, do we come out to our parents?”
Their waveform rang with agreement.
*****
Lina bolted awake. Raefe’s slow slide into sleep ended abruptly. Far Flier and Diver’s picnic lunch on a particularly picturesque cliff was interrupted. Suddenly the four of them had joined the waveform their children had created. It was somehow stronger and more vivid than their normal connections.
“Mom, Dad, Raefe, Lina,” Anti said. “The four of us have some news for you that’s urgent. I know you’ll have many questions, and we can talk afterwards, but there’s some things you must know.”
The four older ones murmured their assent, alarmed and puzzled.
“When I was young, and we were back on A’Nonto, I knew that you were in danger from Hanikori,” Anti continued. “I guess because I was so young and still mastering entanglement, I became very sensitive to his signature in the waveform. It was like he was a scary monster and I wanted to know where he was at all times. Later I learned some other skills and well, the long and short of it is that I basically can entangle with Hanikori at will, without him knowing. In other words, I’ve been watching him since we’ve been on Water Eye.”
“Don’t you realize how dangerous that is?” Far Flier said. “His people control the wormhole interface network, they record all the signatures. He probably knows you’re doing this. And where you are — he can come after you if he wants.”
“Like I said, there’s a lot we have to tell you,” Anti continued. “But for now, no, he can’t. I can connect with him outside of the Guardian network. In fact, we’re all connected that way right now.”
There was a moment of stunned silence as that sunk in.
“Right, so here’s what we know. During ‘Kori’s term as Ambassador to Earth, he developed a thing for powerful humans with little or no empathy. Since he forced you both off of the Council, he convinced himself that Adno, because she’s so physically different than humans, couldn’t possibly be a good ambassador, so he gave her that job. He thinks she’s unaware of what’s going on.”
“And is she?” Diver asked.
“No,” Anti replied. “It’s true that she doesn’t get every nuance of what land dwellers do or think. But she’s just as capable of entangling with humans as you. Raefe and Lina, I believe you have had occasional contact with her?”
“Yes, every now and then,” Raefe said. “In fact, we’ve spoken several times this year. But I do miss my old friend.”
“We do, Diver,” Lina agreed. “Nice to feel your mind after all these years and to know you are well.”
“The same to you both,” Diver said. “But continue, Anti.”
“She alerted Mari and me that something was going on. Raefe, you mentioned to her that you were concerned about a high level summit of major corpos. That clicked for me and I began paying more attention. ‘Kori, it turns out, has recruited Billy Warren, one of the ten most powerful corpos, by becoming a voice in his head that he knows as Hank. Warren is not sure who Hank is, but has come not to care since Hank gives him information that has been worth billions of dollars.”
“Fucking Hanikori,” Far Flier swore. “He’s more of a menace than I thought.”
“And it gets worse,” Mari said.
“Indeed,” said Anti. “As you might expect, the most powerful corpos couldn’t actually agree on anything. I don’t understand all the nuances, but Raefe and Lina, you probably will. I’m going to share the actual meeting with you and Mom and Dad.”
Raefe and Lina felt a surge of images and sounds that must have lasted two or three minutes. As they flowed into their brain, their minds gradually knit together a narrative.
“Oh, shit,” Raefe said. “I’ll try and explain this to you on Water Eye as simply as possible. The whole trend of the last decades has been an increasingly open role for corporations in the running of society. For the first time since our economic system emerged 500 years ago, there’s been a general and deep antagonism between government and corporations. And now Warren and his allies are basically taking the ultimate step and abandoning 99% of the human race.”
“In other words,” Lina said, “an open acknowledgment of the agenda they pursued behind the scenes and without admitting it for centuries.”
“Precisely,” Lina said. “The whole motion of the last 30 years has been to drive toward the greater good for the greater number of people. Warren’s reversing that — the elite must survive and the rest of us can starve or drown.  He promised the summit that he could deliver technology that would allow them and a few million of their friends to live underground, self sufficiently and in style, for hundreds of year while the rest of us die under the weight of floods, drought, food shortages and so on. And here’s the kicker — these elite refugees from history would live for thousands of years. They could emerge from their hidden bunkers in a few centuries and the planet would be theirs.”
“We’re sure that Warren is just the middleman here,” Mari said. “All of this tech, assuming it is real, must be coming from ‘Kori.”
“This is monstrous,” Far Flier said. “And Adno knows of this? Do any other Guardians?”
“Not that we know of,” Anti said.
“You must keep it that way, at least for now,” Far Flier said. “We have to assume that the Guardians are now totally compromised.”
“We’re not sure that’s true,” Mari said. “But I agree that it’s the safe thing to do.”
“And we need to think about how to use this information to defeat them,” Lina said.
“Absolutely,” Raefe said. “This would mean the end of  human society within a generation or two. And that lot underground — can you imagine a new world founded by them? They’d fail within a generation.”
“And now we come to the rest of our story,” Anti said. “About how we were able to learn this. What you guys practiced as Guardians about entanglement is really only part of the story. Adno’s people, for example, are always entangled as a school and have no need of the Guardian interface network since she taught them how to entangle. Des and Nyssa, as twins, have also explored more organic ways of entangling. Because Diver and Far Flier both entangled with Raefe and Lina while I was inside both of them, I was born knowing their signatures. And so I was also able to connect easily with Des and Nyssa, and so was Mari, through her connection with me.”
“You’re saying that the eight of us, and maybe all of Adno’s school, can maintain a waveform across these two planets but outside of the Guardian network?” Diver asked.
“Yes,” Anti said. “Just so. I’m not entirely sure why — my guess is that the Guardian network is actually a simplified, artificial version of a vast natural set of connections that span the galaxy, if not the universe. I don’t understand the physics of it — do our thoughts ride through extra dimensions, do they make the long sought cosmic strings vibrate, something else? But I know it’s real. Once we show you how to initiate the connections, you’ll see it’s actually easier to use than the Guardian network.”
“This changes everything. Diver, we’re not helpless anymore,” Far Flier said.
“No, we most definitely are not,” she said, smiling at the sudden light in his eyes.</Text>

            <Text>Preparing for the end

“One last item that I want to make the council aware of,” Hanikori said. “We haven’t discussed Earth much in recent years, but things have continued to deteriorate there. Much as we expected, humans seem unable to escape a downward spiral of environmental destruction and social violence. Green, do you have anything to add to that?”
“Not really. Just that I will soon re-assign Adno to other duties. I no longer see what there is to gain by having an Ambassador to Earth.”
The waveform reverberated with agreement from the rest of the Council.
“It seems we have consensus on that. Let us know when it is done. And with that, we are adjourned.”
Hanikori and Green had come to the Council offices for the meeting, and now they walked through it’s quiet corridors.
“How did the summit go?” Green asked.
“Quite well. Warren can be very persuasive, especially when he’s promising them an entire world and immortality.”
“Why are you bothering with this? Why not just let nature take its course?”
“Green, sometimes you lack imagination. Did you think we would just be sending the humans drugs and gadgets?”
“In fact, yes. What are you saying?”
“We will have to remake them. Change their genes, the way they raise children, their whole society.”
“Why?”
“Do you think that once we have perfected e21, we would just implement it on ourselves? What if it doesn’t work as we had hoped? What if there are unforeseen consequences?”
“Yes, I’ve wondered all along about that. How can the humans help us with that?”
“There will be a few million of them, living in a controlled environment. Their breeding will be controlled by us, as will their food supply.”
“You’re not saying we would use them as test subjects?”
“I’m saying exactly that. They will be our living laboratory. You seem dismayed.”
“We’re going down a road here that is very dangerous.”
“Green, my friend, we have been on that road all along. You are only now seeing that.”
They walked in silence until they reached the door to the street. Hanikori strode off briskly, Green watching him disappear around a corner. He was rattled by their talk, but he knew what he had to do.

Talks to adno, tells her he has to officially fire her, but unofficially wants her to keep her eyes on Earth. She doesn’t tell him what she already knows and about the kids, etc.

“You told us that Warren had turned the whole summit upside down with his proposal,” Raefe said. “But how did the others react?”
“Somewhat mixed,” Des said. “The Euros were skeptical — they’re up against some of the most organized citizen movements. There wasn’t even anyone from Africa there, by the way, so they’ve ceded that to Nowhere.  Robertson was thrilled — he actually believes all that meritocracy crap, not to mention that he thinks he’s got more merit than the rest of us. The rest mostly fell in line.”
“But even the Euros agreed,” Nyssa said. “On paper, they’re all in.”
“What do you think their timetable is?” Raefe asked.
“Not worked out yet,” Nyssa replied. “That’s the thing — we’re totally in the dark about anything specific. You know how these guys are — I’ll have my computer call your computer.”
“How do we find out more?” Lina asked. “We need to plan a counterattack. I think we need to gather our forces soon — NVA, the Dutch, everyone in or near the Free Alliance.”
“Agreed,” said Raefe. “But we can’t just tell them what we know now and say, ‘hey, what do you think we should do?’ That will be chaos. We need more insight into their plan.”
“Do you think Manfred would  meet with you again?” asked Des. “I have an idea.”
“I think he would,” said Raefe. “Especially if I give him some sense that his bosses are involved in something new and more awful.”
******
Cathedral Square was packed with Barceloni. Nyssa had carefully chosen a small cafe in front of a nondescript boutique hotel in the far corner of the square. From here, she could see all entrances to the square. Manfred might recognize her, but wouldn’t notice Des in a million years. Her brother was sitting on a blanket selling souvenirs just outside the church with a little sign around his neck indicating he was deaf. Raefe had accumulated some pretty tough acquaintances in his recent travels around western Europe and half a dozen of them were scattered around. If Manfred was playing her, he’d regret it quickly.
She had spent the day before shopping for just the right clothes for a young Barcelona woman. In her dark red harem pants, vintage Jordans,  cropped Real Catalan team shirt, and a sheer white headscarf, she fit right in. She could see Manfred scanning the square for her. She had expected the full masterful young corpo get up on him, but he was dressed down in shorts and sandles. She let him search for awhile, reaching out to touch his mind. He was outwardly calm but a little tense inside. To be expected, she thought. If he was part of some plan to kidnap her, he was better at hiding his emotions than she imagined he should be. Finally, she made eye contact and waved him over.
“Look at you,” he said, “a proper little Barca girl.”
“And you,” she answered, “slumming with the tourists. Been awhile, eh?”
“Yeah, I saw your dad last year, but what’s it been, ten years now?”
“Just about. You’re looking well.”
“And you! Nigeria must agree with you.”
“Most days, yes. Dad says Europe has had its ups and downs for you.”
“More like ups and then downs,” he nodded a bit ruefully. “Here in Catalan, you can’t really feel the tremors that are shaking up the rest of Europe. It’s a bit like the last glacier in the Swiss Alps — you can hear it groaning and cracking in the distance but you don’t know whether it will just melt away, or come tumbling down on the villages below. Back in Philips DeMag, you can watch the ice tumble down the mountainside from your kitchen window, as it were.”
“ Where do you think things are going, Manfred?”
Manfred gazed out over the plaza, eyes strangely vacant. She was just about to clear her throat to jog him back when he abruptly turned to her.
“You think that because I have neural implants and have some minor responsibility in the technocracy, that I know things like ‘where it’s all headed.’ I don’t. I hear things, I can guess things. That’s all.”
“Nyssa, I’ve been monitoring his mind,” Des said from a distance. “He was just connected back to Philips’ computer network. Looking something up. Couldn’t tell what.”
“We’re not in danger?” she asked. “He wasn’t signaling someone?”
“No I don’t think so,” Des said. “But I’m paying attention. What I need you to do is get him to access the network again. I think I can hack the system through him.”
“Sorry,” Nyssa said, turning her attention back to Manfred. “Don’t take it the wrong way. I think of you as a friend. We’re all caught up in this. Last century, they had a saying — ‘rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic’— and I don’t want to be that person. None of us do, to be the person yelling ‘Water!’ as the ship sinks. Anything you can tell me that will help us avoid that is very much appreciated.”
“My boss’s boss took part in some kind of big corpo meeting recently,” he said. “I told Raefe about it months ago.”
“Right, in Lausanne. We know who was there, but not what came  of it.”
“You can expect that there were layers to it. The first layer is a big public show of a plan to show they’re on top of things. After that, things get murkier.  And more threatening.”
“How so?”
“The corpos’ business model has evolved as the crisis has deepened. Fifty years ago, their model was get as much money out of the system in the short term as they could. But then they realized that governments were weakening faster than them and their model switched to fostering global privatization, with the top corpos consolidating regional power. Nowhere, the NVA, the Dutch Republic, all the smaller imitators — they’re eating into the corpo revenue stream. And the costs are rising with the waters and the droughts and the rest of it.”
“So, a new business model? Is that what Lausanne was about?”
“Precisely. I don’t know all of the details but I know where they are stored. I know you have people who can hack their way in.”
“I wouldn’t know about that,” she smiled. “But if you want to message me with links to where I might learn more, I’ll see what sense I can make out of it.”
“I”ll do better than that. I’m going to transfer some info to a neutral server. Later I’ll send you a key. Than a location. I have to spread it out to avoid the security bots.”
He got that far away look in his eyes again.
“There, it’s done. Expect the rest within 48 hours.”
Des was telling her that he had got what they needed. “Thanks, Manfred,” she said. “I know this can’t be easy for you. And if you need asylum, you know where to find it.”
“Thanks, Nyssa,” he said, a touch of sadness in his voice. “I feel like that old Greek myth about the kid who flew too close to the sun. We can never lead the life we should have, you know?”
“But we can leave the life we shouldn’t live,” she said. “Just say the word.”
“You take care,” he said, abruptly standing. He squeezed her shoulder and walked off without a glance backward.

            <Notes>Raefe, nyssa and des meet with Manfred in Barcelona, now the Catalan Free State. Des and Nyssa together discover they can hack Manfred’s computer enhancements. Manfred tells them the Euro corpos are in turmoil, something big is happening, no one will say what.
Later, Des gets deep into the Daimler Siemens system and he discovers the Armageddon plan. It’s all going to be triggered by computer, so this gives them a way to stop it.
Raefe and Lina convene their summit. They had been focused on the environment and slowly building up man’s empathic abilities but now its clear that the elites won’t give them that luxury of time. They all agree to sabotage the plan by hacking it and then fully publicizing it.</Notes>

“Over the years, many of you have felt our minds and we’ve been able to exchange what I’ll call a sense of each other,” Raefe said. “Many of you have asked if there’s more we could do, and I’ve always asked for patience. Empathy is not a crop you can harvest. It must grow at its own rate, take root in you, and blossom in its own way. But we no longer have that luxury.”
“Before we proceed, please take a moment to turn off and disconnect any puters, vids, or other devices connected to ‘Net,” Des said. “If you are somewhere that’s not possible — a refrigerator, for example, has to remain on — go outside. You must be at least 20 meters from any working connected device.”
“OK, thanks for your patience with all of this drama,” Lina said. “But it is neccessary. We’ve all been trying to understand what the corpos have in store for us, and now we think we know. But we are also concerned about them knowing that we know. So we have taken extraordinary steps to make sure this conversation cannot be hacked. We have enlisted others with highly developed empathic skills to create a global network of entangled consciousness. You need not speak — just think your thoughts as if you were saying them, and we will all receive them. Think of an image if you want us to see it.”
“As most of you know, the most powerful corpos recently held a secret meeting in Lausanne,” Raefe said. “On the surface, the meeting was to agree that they would unite in a new entity called Liberty. We’ve put huge pressure on the corpos with our various new social experiments and this is them responding. Liberty, it turns out, isn’t that different than any other corpo state except that it’s international.

            <Title>Scene about Debris</Title>
            <Text>The pub was vibrating with dark pulses at a fierce volume. Some pop star was on the vids wearing a rugby helmet with large horns, like some deranged Viking athlete.
“Just like my local,” Claire said. “Feel right at home here.”
“If you’re home is in an underground mine,” Raefe said. “You like this music?”
“Don’t tell me you’ve never heard Debris?” Claire said.
“That’s who this is?”
“Yeah. That’s him up on the vid wall — Johnny Debrise.”
Raefe switched his ‘puter to the vid channel. The host was attempting to interview Debrise.
“Johnny, we’re showing the fans an early picture of you and Black Mark Debree and Yellow Jay Debry. Tell us about it.”
“Not much to say, mate. We were kids with a passion for the music. Right place at the right time — end of the world and all that.”
“Our sponsors won’t like that Johnny — still so many things left to sell! But here’s something interesting I want to get your opinion on. We did a deep search and we can’t actually find any record of any of you before this picture. The whole Debris thing — is it all just a put on, Johnny? The Asian guy named Black Mark, the white guy Yellow Jay, and you, you might be mistaken for African. Take us back to when you were all born, the real people.”
“Born, you think we were born? Plenty of people been made in factories these days, don’t you know that?”
“Are you saying you’re a biohack, Johnny?”
“Not me, mate. Maybe you?”
“Nothing so exotic. So you weren’t born to a mother and you weren’t raised in glass dish. What then?”
“When them meteors crash into earth, new lifeforms arise. Just listen.”
He turned around and the band was behind them.He snapped his fingers and a deafening roar arose from the band, like boulders tumbling down a mountain.
“See, when the meteors crash into Earth, life arises from the Debris. That’s our life story.”
Claire was laughing heartily.”No one can play electric asteroid like Debris.”

Empathy is not a crop you can harvest. It must grow at its own rate, take root in you, and blossom in its own way. But we no longer have that luxury.”
“Before we proceed, please take a moment to turn off and disconnect any puters, vids, or other devices connected to ‘Net,” Des said. “If you are somewhere that’s not possible — a refrigerator, for example, has to remain on — go outside. You must be at least 20 meters from any working connected device.”
“OK, thanks for your patience with all of this drama,” Lina said. “But it is neccessary. We’ve all been trying to understand what the corpos have in store for us, and now we think we know. But we are also concerned about them knowing that we know. So we have taken extraordinary steps to make sure this conversation cannot be hacked. We have enlisted others with highly developed empathic skills to create a global network of entangled consciousness. You need not speak — just think your thoughts as if you were saying them, and we will all receive them. Think of an image if you want us to see it.”
“As most of you know, the most powerful corpos recently held a secret meeting in Lausanne,” Raefe said. “On the surface, the meeting was to agree that they would unite in a new entity called Liberty. We’ve put huge pressure on the corpos with our various new social experiments and this is them responding. Liberty, it turns out, isn’t that different than any other corpo state except that it’s international.

            <Text>High level meetings
Lausanne, Switzerland
October 14, 2081

Billy Warren could never get used to the Swiss. They took an inordinate pride in being small and disconnected from everything around them. Their happiest moments seemed to be when you handed them money — plastic, cash or check, it didn’t matter — but they had little ambition to do anything with it except accumulate it. Not that he didn’t understand that impulse, but where was their creative spirit? Where were the buildings, the inventions, the accomplishments that said “I made this and it changed everything?” Still making mechanical watches — that was their idea of ingenuity.
Yet, it had a harsh beauty, this place. Looking over Lake Geneva at sunset, the view was gorgeous, if empty. No boats and certainly no swimmers marred it’s surface. The mountains of the southern shore were reflected in almost perfect fidelity on it’s cold, still surface. With the Gulf Stream submerging, the storms that had brought the northern British Isles to their knees had still had enough in them to whiten the tops of the high Alps, glistening in the distance. If you wanted to, you could mistake them for glaciers. 
The fate of the glaciers was not his concern. They had come, they had gone, life would go on. And someone would have to be at the top of that pile of life. That was a struggle he understood, relished.
“You are ready, I see.”
“Indeed,” he thought. “We have a strong hand in the negotiations. Any poker player will tell you, the best cards bring the best luck.”
He had gotten used to these dialogs with the voice who called himself Hank. At first, he thought he might be going crazy. But over time, Hank had definitely given him insights and information that he could never know on his own. He had decided that Hank was some kind of super-hacker who had found his way into his MindsEye, the top of the line puter implants that people of his station owned.
“Who do you fear the most at these talks?” Hank asked.
“Fear? I don’t really fear any of them. We’re all basically on the same side. But if you mean, who’s most likely to oppose me, it’s the Euros, hands down. They still think we can make some kind of grand deal, some kind of hybrid between old-fashioned governments and corporate states. They’re always going on about how they pioneered that idea back in the 20th century.”
“It didn’t work then either. All it did was submerge the elite in a morass of mediocrity,” Hank said. “Held humanity back.”
“Try telling them that.”
“No, no point, I agree,” Hank replied. “But I think we have some aces up our sleeves.”
And before Billy could ask what, Hank did one of those fire-hose brain fills he sometimes did. Billy’s mind was flooded with new knowledge, new possibilities and he understood then how he would win the day in the negotiations. Hank had given him a hand full of aces — no one could top them. He walked back to his room and watched a vid. By 11 he was sleeping like a baby.
In the morning, they all gathered on the far terrace, the sun now just peeking over the distant mountains. They had rented the hotel in its entirety. No tourists, traveling salesmen or prying journalists. Just the 14 most powerful business men and women in the world. They all had MindsEyes, no need for assistants cluttering up the meeting.
Billy looked around at the group. There was Alden Hayashi, who commanded a powerful set of Pacific Rim financial services firms that was the only realistic counterweight to the Chinese government in the region. From the Americas, Mario Munoz had amassed a fortune in financial services and privatized governmental services throughout the US, Canada, Mexico and the smaller Central American countries. Ken Robertson, whose DigiBrands represented a century of mergers between ancient tech giants like Apple and Microsoft and a host of consumer products and communications companies. Ilana Romero ran Brazil’s PetroBras empire — one of his main competitors in the resource industries — but also a string of South American telecommunications and biotech manufacturing companies.
The Euros had a committee of five men and women, a mix of old and new money, that were backed by Daimler Siemens, Philips DeMag, Fiat, United Financial Services and several other large Euro conglomerates. Wang Ya Chen presided over China’s giant mining, manufacturing and electronics concerns. Adnan Arjan led over 1,000 companies that dominated the Indian subcontinent, as well as parts of the Middle East and East Africa. Prince Ibn bin Ibn held the keys to the Saudi royal treasury, which had managed to survive the decline of oil and now had its fingers in many pies throughout the Middle East, Africa and around the world. And Susan Mbuto owned many different businesses throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
“Ladies and gentlemen, let’s get started,” Billy said. “No need for introductions, you all know each other. I called this meeting because we’ve seen some major developments recently, and we all need to get grounded in them. What’s on your minds?”
Dieter Freundlich had been wearing a hole in his seat waiting for his chance.
“The stunt by the Republic of Holland to launch this so-called global citizenship is deeply troubling to us.”
“Well, we certainly didn’t anticipate it,” Robertson said. “But what’s your main concern?”
“Loss of revenue, of course. Their tax rate is actually low, and their benefits package is above austerity. Remember the Greek crisis in the early 21st century? Imagine if the Greek citizens could have joined Holland then. They would have gutted Greece, and Europe, in turn.”
“But isn’t Holland likely to attract citizens who are a revenue loss?” Robertson persisted. “Take out more than they put in?”
“You are confusing us with what’s left of the European Union,” Ericka Weinsberg of Daimler Siemens said. “Where we have achieved something like your autonomous zones in North America, we have very few social obligations. We may collect less revenue than you do, but we still do collect some, and it adds up.”
“As well, it creates a very difficult situation to navigate. Everywhere we operate as a company now, we have a strong position and we have a single adversary — the local government. Now there is a third party, Holland. As a former government, they understand our moves and motives, and they are able to play our game, divide and conquer, some of the time.”
“Only if you let them, right” Warren interjected. “What armies does Holland have to back up their claims?”
“Well, I think that’s the point, Billy,” Freundlich said. “The whole country is an army, with troops everywhere.”
“When I see their rifles, I’ll believe they’re an army,” Warren said. Could these Euros really be afraid of slogans and t-shirts?
“The Chinese government has made it a crime to be a Citizen of Holland,” Wang Ya Chen said. “They were particularly concerned about the concept of ‘guaranteeing your rights wherever you live.’ China takes a dim view of foreign governments interfering with internal Chinese affairs. We have encouraged the Chinese government to pursue this policy, with the side benefit of diverting their energies from their incessant campaign to dominate our companies. Although this has increased tension between Chinese people in crisis areas and the government, that too is to our advantage. With each crisis, our offers to take over management become more attractive to both the government and people.”
“Is that a generally acceptable strategy then — encourage the local governments to clamp down on Hollanders within their borders?” Warren was growing weary of this topic. The Euro delegates looked unhappy, but looked at each other and nodded agreement. “Ok, let’s move on. Mbuto?”
“We sympathize with our European colleagues. Africa has been plagued by disruptive groups. Traditionally, this has benefited us. These groups keeps the government busy without pushing for any alternative. But now we have some wild cards. The biggest one has just concluded a meeting of 10,000 people in Dadaab. They claim to have 70 million members globally. I believe they will solve the Holland problem, in a way — Holland will join this new group, which calls itself Everywhere, and also offers a universal citizenship. But they are much more ambitious.”
She broadcast to their implants a report on the Dadaab meeting, including their new mission statement.
“These people ever set foot in my territory, I’ll shoot ‘em on sight,” Warren growled.
“Their leader is actually from America,” Mbuto said. “Although he married an Afro-Chinese woman 30 years ago and has travelled the world ever since. He’s a bit of a mystery.”
“I’m reaching out to my contacts at Brightstar,” Robertson said. “We have an ownership stake in them and they do a lot of security work.”
“We see his followers in our country,” Romero said. “He’s worked with Favelas United, coffee worker groups, all sorts of marginal people. Mario, you must see his followers in Mexico, no?”
“Si,” Munoz said. “For awhile, they called him El Poco Jesus — the Little Jesus — but he made them stop.”
“The mullahs have kept him out of Iran,” Adnan said. “What is it that his followers are attracted to?”
“He preaches empathy,” Mbuto said. “His followers say he teaches you to look into people’s hearts and know what they really feel.”
“Jesus wept,” Warren said. “Are we getting weak-kneed over some guy who reads palms now?”
“We had that attitude, too,” Hayashi said. “About five years ago, he showed up in Japan. Along the coastline, we have millions of Rising Tide people. When he arrived, they had been organized into little fleets of boats along ethnic lines: Japanese, Filipino, Malay, Korean, Taiwanese. They fought each other often enough to neutralize them as a threat either to corporate or state power. He went from port to port, preaching this empathy.  Now, if you go to the coast, you’ll see thousands of Rising Tide boats, and almost none of them have any of the national flags they used to. It’s all the drowning rising sun emblem. And our agents say that the ethnic gangs have disappeared from the Rising Tide communities. So we don’t know how he does it, but we don’t joke about him anymore.”
“That seems to be what he’s trying to do with Everywhere,” Mbuto said. “His wife helped form it, too. She was part of Citizens of Nowhere, but it was a very small group when she joined 30 years ago. Now, well, you see they pulled together a meeting of 10,000 people. Not a demonstration, a meeting. The people were sent by other groups to attend. So it’s really a much larger and widely dispersed group they represent.”
“I’ve got that report back,” Robertson said. “Hmmm, seems like the first time he popped up was about 30 years go. Some of you may remember the Reagan Institute fiasco at MIT. They hired some academics to build a prediction engine that could be used calibrate how hard we could push people. Turned out the team was infliltrated by Brazilian anarchists. He was on the team, although pretty junior. He was a talented game programmer who worked for one of my outfts. They lent him to create the “whatif” part of the program. After it all went down, my folks did an analysis of the code. They found some unusual stuff, but they didn’t understand it. Still don’t. But he disappeared right after Elise Pasos, the Brazilian infiltrator, was killed. Now we know — he went to Africa, to his girlfriend.”
“Well, this sounds like a problem for our security team, eh?” Warren said. Heads nodded. That was their giving assent to whatever was neccessary to neutralize this odd threat. “Ken, can you have Brightstar liase with everyone else’s security people and come up with a plan?”
“Sure,” Robertson said. Warren would talk to him later. They’d put a stop to this guy quick, this whole movement would collapse. That was the beauty of hero cults — take the hero out, there was no cult.
“Alright, I think we’ve covered the high attention items we agended before the meeting. Some things have come up just recently, though, and I’m going to exercise host’s prerogative to put some new things out there. Ken, I think it’s time for our presentation.”
“Thanks, Billy. As leaders of various corporate states, we’ve all been faced with multiple challenges. Governments and citizen groups are now mounting what I believe is our most serious challenge — alternative citizenship that promises them both material benefits and a sense of belonging. I put to you that we have to compete on that playing field, and Billy and I have a proposal that does just that.”
The room was silent for a minute as their implants processed his proposal.
“I think this is brilliant, Ken,” said Hayashi. “Liberty, the first global corporate state for members only!”
“Thanks,” Rosenberg replied. “You will all note that Liberty is specifically designed to cripple our opponents’ funding. Citizens of Liberty must pledge not to pay taxes to any other entity. We want to ensure that Holland does not recruit too many high wealth people by appealing to their do-gooder side.”
“Your proposal indicates that Liberty’s governance will be by executive committee of this body as founders,” Gerhard Freundlich said. “No messy, ultra-democratic parliament. So it differs from Holland in that way. But how does it differ as far as benefits to its citizens go?”
“It’s a totally different beast,” Rosenberg said. “It’s clear from the start that Liberty will protect private property and not interfere with personal freedoms. But it will also not be a welfare state. Citizens will have to provide for themselves, but they won’t have to provide for large numbers of unproductive people. It’s a nation of doers.”
“I’m not sure that makes it competitive with Holland,” Freundlich replied. “And in some ways, it sounds like another Citizens of Nowhere, just with an annual membership fee. They have neither that nor taxes.”
“Property, Gerhard.” Billy said. “We protect their property. We will be the last great protection for those who have bothered to accumulate property. Don’t you think the world’s property owners will welcome the chance to right the ship and stop the never-ending assault on their rights? Surely, they’ll see that’s the only way to continue to grow as a society, to restore the profit motive to some place of pride?”
“Mr. Warren, if I may,” said Freundlich, “only recently the most profitable part of the Dutch Republic dug a canal to separate itself from the Philips DeMag Corporate State, the largest employer in Holland, and declared itself independent. These sorts of fractures will become more common, until our societies are so highly fragmented that they will cease to exist. So no, our eyes are right now not on re-writing the past, but on saving the future.”
“Mr. Freundlich has a point,” Adnan Arjan said. “We are putting this approach into what is basically a hostile environment. We won’t win everyone over. There will be multiple futures out there for the taking for some time.”
“We don’t have that kind of luxury,” Wang Ya Chen said. “We’re looking at massive relocations from our most developed, populous areas. And to many places that are strained for water or other resources. That will not happen easily or peacefully.”
“Let’s not get carried away,” Warren said. “We’re not here to solve the entire world’s problems — just ours. Liberty is designed to staunch the wound while we prepare the second phase.”
“Right,” Rosenberg said. “If you look past the first five to ten years of the plan, you’ll see that we anticipate only partial success. We expect that we will recruit several hundred million of the world’s wealthiest people to Liberty.  That will give us both legitimacy and power to fend off local opposition for some time. As of now, there is no coordinated international opposition that can oppose us in a forceful manner.”
“And when they do?” asked Illana Romero. “Because in South America, we fully expect the Capoiera Communal to challenge us.”
“Well, we haven’t completed the Phase 2 plan yet, but the outlines are simple,” Rosenberg said. “We divert some of the revenue we collect from citizens to build self-sustaining, underground communities in secret. Once we’ve gotten about 50% of the way with that, we accelerate that by threatening to disrupt the key goods and services our businesses provide outside the corporate states if governments and other entities don’t pay us higher fees.”
“And when they stop paying?” Romero asked.
“Look, we can play Ouija here all day,” Warren interjected. “Long story short — the wealthiest people in the world are going to build themselves private underground luxury cities and disappear while the rest of humanity tears itself apart fighting over a shrinking pie. After a century or so, we’ll resurface and the whole world will be Liberty. We can reclaim the Earth, and forget these crazy ideas about going to other planets.”
“And who will do all of this?” Freundlich asked. “Who will build these cities, keep them running? Where will all those laborers come from?”
“That’s easy,” Rosenberg said. “They’ll come from my factories and yours. At long last, we’ll have a world where robots do all the work. We’ll cut deals with engineering talent to let them work off their membership fees so that we can continue to develop the software, but other than that, it’ll be robots making robots to do what we need them to do.”
“But what if humanity hangs on?” Freundlich asked. “What if after a few generations, sure many have died, but many remain and are not willing to give up?”
“This is a very interesting discussion, but I think I can contribute a clincher to it,” Warren said, “I’ve been working with some amazing scientists who can make being a Liberty citizen a very long-lived proposition for those who merit it. And that will guarantee a stable core of like-minded people who can guide Liberty through the difficult times ahead.”
“What are you saying?” Freundlich asked. “That you have some kind of fountain of youth drug?”
“Much more than that,” Warren said. “I’m beaming you a description of a package of technologies that will enhance any human who installs them. We won’t know how long we can live until we actually use them, but more than 300 years is a safe bet, and it could range higher than 1,000. And that’s without the mental and physical decay we now expect in our later years.”
The room was quiet as they absorbed the news.
“Well, if there are no objections,” Warren said. “Let’s move on to talking about how to implement this plan.”</Text>

Traveller’s Perch
November 17, 2081
“One last item that I want to make the council aware of,” Hanikori said. “We haven’t discussed Earth much in recent years, but things have continued to deteriorate there. Much as we expected, humans seem unable to escape a downward spiral of environmental destruction and social violence. Green, do you have anything to add to that?”
“Not really. Just that I will soon re-assign Adno to other duties. I no longer see what there is to gain by having an Ambassador to Earth.”
The waveform reverberated with agreement from the rest of the Council.
“It seems we have consensus on that. Let us know when it is done. And with that, we are adjourned.”
Hanikori and Green had come to the Council offices for the meeting, and now they walked through it’s quiet corridors.
“How did the summit go?” Green asked.
“Quite well. Warren can be very persuasive, especially when he’s promising them an entire world and immortality.”
“Why are you bothering with this? Why not just let nature take its course?”
“Green, sometimes you lack imagination. Did you think we would just be sending the humans drugs and gadgets?”
“In fact, yes. What are you saying?”
“We will have to remake them. Change their genes, the way they raise children, their whole society.”
“Why?”
“Do you think that once we have perfected e12, we would just implement it on ourselves? What if it doesn’t work as we had hoped? What if there are unforeseen consequences?”
“Yes, I’ve wondered all along about that. How can the humans help us with that?”
“There will be millions of them, living in a controlled environment. Their breeding will be controlled by us, as will their food supply.”
“You’re not saying we would use them as test subjects?”
“I’m saying exactly that. They will be our living laboratory. You seem dismayed.”
“We’re going down a road here that is very dangerous.”
“Green, my friend, we have been on that road all along. You are only now seeing that.”
They walked in silence until they reached the door to the street. Hanikori strode off briskly, Green watching him disappear around a corner. He was rattled by their talk, but he knew what he had to do.
*****
“The moment we all feared is close,” Adno said. “I’ve been reassigned from Earth.”
“To what?” Diver asked.
“That’s just it. Nothing. And no one is taking my place. Green seems to be running things, for Hanikori, no doubt.”
“I’m glad you called us here, Adno,” Mari said.  “I’ve been monitoring some of the Guardians back on A’Nonto and something seriously messed up is going on. Can you guys listen to this?”
She sent them her memories of Hantikori’s recent conversation with Green, and some of Hanikori’s memories of his conversations with Billy Warren.
“Can you believe this?” Antithikos said, his thoughts tinged with anger. “This Hantikori is really just too much.”
“We have to tell Raefe and Lina,” Mari said.
“No!” Flier said. “With Hanikori and Green in charge, they’ll know everything that goes through the wormhole interface.”
Anti and Mari looked uncomfortable.
“You should not worry about that, Flier who has flown between planets,” Adno said. “I, who have also flown between planets, can swim far distances with my mind. With many minds. No Guardians will know.”
“What are you saying, Adno?” Diver said. Was Adno just using some of her usual watery metaphors, or was there more to it.
“When Mari explained to you how our people have always been entangled,” she replied, “she did not tell you the entire story. Because I learned to entangle without the wormhole interface network, I don’t really need it. Once I learned to sing the Guardian waveform, I was capable of finding it without Guardian technology.”
“This changes everything,” Flier said. “We have a secret weapon, Diver! We can fight back!”
“You have other secret weapons, father mom,” Mari said. “Because I learned this skill from Adno, and Anti did too, we were able to teach it to Des and Nyssa. After all, when were both inside mommom, she had much contact with Raefe and Lina, and through Lina to her twins inside her.”
“Ah, the universe continues to tickle us,” Diver said.”But this is great news. We must bring Raefe and Lina into the picture.”
*****
Lina bolted awake. Raefe’s slow slide into sleep ended abruptly.  Suddenly they had both joined the waveform Adno had created. She was there, along with Des and Nyssa, and Diver and Flier and Anti and Mari. It was somehow stronger and more vivid than their normal connections.
“We have news for you that’s urgent, and some other matters, too,” Adno said.
“Go ahead,” Raefe said, back safely from London.
“Yeah, ready here in Dadaab,” Lina said.
“We want you to know that something rotten is happening with the Guardians,” Adno said. “They are ending their guardianship of Earth. I’ve been reassigned.”
“We’ve kept you out of a lot of Guardian politics over the years,” Diver said, “because we had no thought it would go this far. But now you need to know. Flier was pushed out of the directorship some time ago and a man named Hanikori  took over.”
“We think he’s insane,” Flier said. “We also think he’s interfering with Earth in a big way.”
“Before Diver was ambassador to Earth,” Adno said, “Hanikori was for about 10 years. He failed miserably at it, but now I think that he planted some seeds there. He has interfered with a variety of bad people and continues to this very day. I’m quite sure that he as regular contact with a man named Billy Warren.”
“Warren? Now things are starting to make sense,” Raefe said. “Warren is allied with other large corpos. One of them is Ken Robertson. His security forces have been trying to kill me — they took a shot at me just recently.”
“And we’ve heard through other sources,” Nyssa said, “that the corpos recently had a secret meeting of global leaders. They can rarely agree on what kind of water to drink, so it must have been important.”
“I think our source inside the corpos will tell us more,” Raefe said. “Nyssa, can you contact him again?”
“Yes, sure,” she said. “And Adno, can you try and go deeper on your end?”
“We all will,” Adno replied.
“OK, I think this is actually a great moment,” Raefe said. “The declaration of Everywhere seems to have stirred the hornet’s nest, as it were. But you know, I’m puzzled. This all feels different than usual. Somehow closer. Is something different.”
“You were always so attuned,” Diver said. “And you are right. Flier and I have been surprised about this new development, too, just a little while ago. We’ll let Adno explain.”
“What Diver taught you about entanglement is really only part of the story,” Adno said. “My people, for example, are always entangled as a school and have no need of the Guardian interface network. Mari learned that from us, and she taught Anti. Because both of them knew you while they were inside Diver, they knew your signatures at birth. And Des and Nyssa’s. And as twins, they have always known each other in the waveform as well.” 
“You’re saying that the eight of us, and maybe all of Adno’s school, can maintain a waveform across these great distances but outside of the Guardian network?” Lina asked.
“Yes,” Anti said. “Just so. I’m not entirely sure why — my guess is that the Guardian network is actually a simplified, artificial version of a vast natural set of connections that span the galaxy, if not the universe. I don’t understand the physics of it — do our thoughts ride through extra dimensions, do they make the long sought cosmic strings vibrate, something else? But I know it’s real. Once we show you how to initiate the connections, you’ll see it’s actually easier to use than the Guardian network.”
“This changes everything. We’ll have the advantage of surprise,” Raefe said.
“Just what we thought, old friend,” Flier said.</Text>

Barcelona, Republic of Catalan
January 12, 2082
Cathedral Square was packed with Barceloni. Nyssa had carefully chosen a small cafe in front of a nondescript boutique hotel in the far corner of the square. From here, she could see all entrances to the square. Manfred might recognize her, but wouldn’t notice Des in a million years. Her brother was sitting on a blanket selling souvenirs just outside the church with a little sign around his neck indicating he was deaf. Raefe had accumulated some pretty tough acquaintances in his recent travels around western Europe and half a dozen of them were scattered around. If Manfred was playing her, he’d regret it quickly.
She had spent the day before shopping for just the right clothes for a young Barca woman. In her dark red harem pants, retro football trainers,  a baggy vintage Real Catalan team shirt, and a sheer white headscarf, she fit right in. She could see Manfred scanning the square for her. She had expected the full masterful young corpo uniform on him, but he was dressed down in sweats and trainers. She let him search for awhile, reaching out to touch his mind. He seemed calm but a little tense. To be expected, she thought. If he was part of some plan to kidnap her, he was better at hiding his emotions than she imagined he should be. Finally, she made eye contact and waved him over.
“Look at you,” he said, “a proper little Barca girl.”
“And you,” she answered, “slumming with the tourists. Been awhile, eh?”
“Yeah, I saw your dad recently, but what’s it been, ten years now?”
“Just about. You’re looking well.”
“And you! Africa must agree with you.”
“Most days, yes. Dad says Europe has had its ups and downs for you.”
“More like ups and then downs,” he nodded a bit ruefully. “Here in Catalan, you can’t really feel the tremors that are shaking up the rest of Europe. It’s a bit like the last glacier in the Swiss Alps — you can hear it groaning and cracking in the distance but you don’t know whether it will just melt away, or come tumbling down on the villages below. Back in Philips DeMag, you can watch the ice tumble down the mountainside from your kitchen window, as it were.”
“Yes, well Kenya isn’t exactly calm either. Hasn’t been for, well, long before either of us. Where do you think things are going, Manfred?”
Manfred gazed out over the plaza, eyes strangely vacant. She was just about to clear her throat to jog him back when he abruptly turned to her.
“You think that because I have neural implants and have some minor responsibility in the technocracy, that I know things like ‘where it’s all headed.’ I don’t. I hear things, I can guess things. That’s all.”
“Nyssa, I’ve been monitoring his mind,” Des said from a distance. “He was just connected back to Philips’ computer network. Looking something up. Couldn’t tell what.”
“We’re not in danger?” she asked. “He wasn’t signaling someone?”
“No I don’t think so,” Des said. “But I’m paying attention. What I need you to do is get him to access the network again. I think I can hack the system through him.”
“Sorry,” Nyssa said, turning her attention back to Manfred. “Don’t take it the wrong way. I think of you as a friend. We’re all caught up in this. Last century, they had a saying — ‘rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic’— and I don’t want to be that person. None of us do, to be the person yelling ‘Water!’ as the ship sinks. Anything you can tell me that will help us avoid that is very much appreciated.”
“My boss’s boss took part in some kind of big corpo meeting recently,” he said. “I told Raefe about it months ago.”
“Right, in Lausanne. We know who was there, but not what came  of it.”
“You can expect that there were layers to it. The first layer is a big public show of a plan to show they’re on top of things. After that, things get murkier.  And more threatening.”
“How so?”
“The corpos’ business model has evolved as the crisis has deepened. Fifty years ago, their model was get as much money out of the system in the short term as they could. But then they realized that governments were weakening faster than them and their model switched to fostering global privatization, with the top corpos consolidating regional power. Nowhere, the NVA, the Dutch Republic, all the smaller imitators — they’re eating into the corpo revenue stream. And the costs are rising with the waters and the droughts and the rest of it.”
“So, a new business model? Is that what Lausanne was about?”
“Precisely. I don’t know all of the details but I know where they are stored. I know you have people who can hack their way in.”
“I wouldn’t know about that,” she smiled. “But if you want to message me with links to where I might learn more, I’ll see what sense I can make out of it.”
“I”ll do better than that. A week ago, just before you called, I got a visit from a top exec at Philips DeMag. He was at the summit. Turns out they’ve been keeping tabs on our little talks for years. Always useful to have contacts, they say. Anyway, Philips DeMag wants you to know the plan. I don’t know it — they don’t trust me with it. But they want you to know. It must be so horrible if they’ve opted out. I’m going to transfer some info to a neutral server. Later I’ll send you a key. Than a location. I have to spread it out to avoid the security bots.”
He got that far away look in his eyes again.
“There, it’s done. Expect the rest within 48 hours.”
Des was telling her that he had got what they needed. “Thanks, Manfred,” she said. “I know this can’t be easy for you. And if you need asylum, you know where to find it.”
“Thanks, Nyssa,” he said, a touch of sadness in his voice. “I feel like that old Greek myth about the kid who flew too close to the sun. We can never lead the life we should have, you know?”
“But we can leave the life we shouldn’t have,” she said. “Just say the word.”
“You take care,” he said, abruptly standing. He squeezed her shoulder and walked off without a glance backward.

            <Notes>Raefe, nyssa and des meet with Manfred in Barcelona, now the Catalan Free State. Des and Nyssa together discover they can hack Manfred’s computer enhancements. Manfred tells them the Euro corpos are in turmoil, something big is happening, no one will say what.
Later, Des gets deep into the Daimler Siemens system and he discovers the Armageddon plan. It’s all going to be triggered by computer, so this gives them a way to stop it.
Raefe and Lina convene their summit. They had been focused on the environment and slowly building up man’s empathic abilities but now its clear that the elites won’t give them that luxury of time. They all agree to sabotage the plan by hacking it and then fully publicizing it.</Notes>

Water Eye
September 21, 2081

Diver loved sitting on this rock after fishing. She had her own name for it — Hawk’s Haven — but she knew Far Flier would think it sentimental and silly, so it remained her private name. Whatever Far Flier might think, it was a good name for this solitary rock, standing 20 meters high just off the beach. From the top, she could see the silver flash of bait fish far out into the water, the ripples where blue trout disturbed those schools, and the swells of Adno’s people as they herded the blue trout into the shallows, where they could feast on them as needed.
 She stripped off her flight suit, lounging on the rocks while Prime dried her. At first, the sky had seemed nothing like Traveller’s Perch, even though it was the same solar system. But after 30 years, it had become just as familiar as the view of her first 450 years.
She had been surprised at how hard it had been to accommodate to this new place. Her mind had traveled so many places through the wormhole interface network, she hadn’t understood how different it would be to stand on a different piece of rock, with a different sky. But she shuddered to think about what would have happened had Adno not warned them of Hanikori’s plot. She and Far Flier had been paralyzed by the news, but Adno had already arranged a “supervisory” visit from them and a convenient failure of their ship, preventing them returning. Hanikori had at first insisted on rescuing him, but they made a very public plea to remain on this world, they loved it too much to leave. He had been forced to drop the matter and settle for their permanent exile from Traveller’s Perch.
 Antithikos had just been born when they had come here, and he took to it well enough. When he was hungry, when he wanted to sleep, when he wanted to play — these became the new rhythms of their life. A few years later, just before Far Flier had undergone her transformation to female, the two of them had bred Marilon. They spent much time in the water, hoping to acclimate her to it. And it had worked.
After she was born, Mari took to the water like an alaktar, the marine birds of their home world. Diver, Anti and Flier were typical A’Nontans, broad across the shoulders and long in the arms but slight in the legs and feet, even if not as slight or long-armed as their ancestors. Mari was longer in the leg and shorter in the arm — a swimmer’s build. Even her enhancements adapted themselves to be as adept in and on water as on land and in the air. For Far Flier and Diver, it was a pleasant and surprising reminder of just how flexible life can be, a message they had perhaps needed in their sometimes lonely exile. 
As she trudged up the hill, she could see the place they’d called home for these many years. When they had come, Adno’s people had adapted the typical Water Eye underwater reef structure for them, grown from engineered corals. Diver and Flier had rigged up a system of pulleys and ramps to bring it out of the water and up here on the ridge in the middle of their small island. They had become the first intelligent land dwellers on Water Eye. Unlike their homes on  Traveller’s Perch, it didn’t morph to meet their needs. It had taken some getting used to, living in a structure that never changed. But then, they had changed it in little ways, decorating it with shells and branches and pieces of the bright blue stone that stuck out from the rock here and there on their island.
Her reminiscing about creating their home was interrupted by as her family’s minds begin to brush hers. Long ago, she had glimpsed an image in one of the human’s minds — was it Raefe or Lina? — from an Earth story about someone living all alone in a forest who kept a candle in the window in case strangers were looking for warmth in the cold nights of their winter. That’s what her brood’s minds felt like just now.
“My fierce mother mother,” Anti greeted her. “You’ve been fishing.”
“Fierce?” she protested. “So you only want to eat leaves now?”
“Why don’t you let Adno’s school bring us fish?” Mari asked. “It’s nothing for them. I can even swim out to them and retrieve it so they don’t need to come all the way here.”
“I do let them bring us things,” she said. “I let them bring us things from the deeps and from the bottom, things we cannot get for ourselves. I like fishing.”
“We should teach our children to hunt, don’t you think,” Flier said, laughing at the whole familiar conversation. “What kind of person is it who must ask another species to feed them?”
“The kind who lives on the world of water, father mother,” Anti shot back, who was always embarrassed at his parents’ insistence on maintaining their old rituals from their old world, a home fading from his memory and never seen by his sister.
“If that bastard Hantikori falls in a volcano someday, we should take a chance on you both joining the waveform back there,” Diver said. “I love this world, and I’m so grateful for Adno and her school to take us in, but I worry that you don’t get to feel so many of the joys we had growing up on Prime.”
“Wouldn’t that be nice,” Flier agreed, knowing it was better to agree with her than remind her how unlikely that was. “But the children and I have been talking with Adno and she brings news from the Guardians.”
“Oh,” Diver replied. “Good or bad?”
“Well, likely bad,” Flier said. “Hantikori is bringing back the old ideas of more direct intervention. Maybe even technology transfers.”
“He’s a fool,” Diver said. “Every 10,000 years or so, some madman like him steers the Guardians in that direction and it never ends well.”
“Much worse, actually, than you may know,” Flier said. “In the distant past, some of these misguided leaders actually brought about the destruction of entire species due to their meddling.”
“I can’t stand it! Stuck hear on this island, cut off from the waveform, watching your life’s work, and what was to be mine, dissolved in an acid of egotism and foolishness. Even after these eons of learning and peace, to know that this can still happen.”
“Wisdom is no more solid than this island,” Flier replied. “Battered and worn by waves of all sorts. But you know that. I sense that something more specific is bothering you.”
“Walking up the hill, I remembered a little story from Raefe. I miss the humans, I miss the freshness and boldness of their struggles. We have so much built up knowledge and technology and the help of 19 other races to guide us. They have none of that, yet they are so firm in fighting for their own future. Even when they are wrong, their passion wins my heart. I can’t bear to think of what will happen to them if Hanikori and his foolish little clique meddle in their world.”
“We’ll have to trust that Adno can prevent that,” Far Flier said, but Diver could see in her eyes that she was worried as well.
“Our moms are distraught,” Anti thought, letting only Mari know. “It’s painful to feel them.”
“Exiles on a world they don’t really understand, robbed of the purpose they prepared centuries for,” Mari answered. “I want to tell them that it’s not as hopeless as they think.”
“Yes, it’s time,” Anti agreed. He opened his thoughts again to his parents. “Don’t count out Adno. She is more powerful than you think.”
“I know you admire her,” Diver said. “But she’s just one person.”
“No, she’s not,” Mari said. “She’s one person among a whole school. We used to fly as flock, but even then, we were solitary much of the time. Not Adno’s people. They live their entire lives in the school, all the time.”
“What are you saying?” Far Flier said.
“That Adno’s people have their own waveform, always did,” Mari answered, “long before they joined the Guardians and mastered the wormhole interface network. Their far distant ancestors evolved from giant sentient mats of many kinds of micro-organisms, all entangled in a primitive network. The comets that broke up those networks did not destroy that — they only divided the mats into smaller mats, each of which evolved in its own way. One branch continued to evolve and became the schools. They have always been entangled. The water around them carries their smells and vibrations and the echoes of the electricity in their brains. She has the wisdom and strength of her whole school, and sometimes, her whole species.”
Diver suddenly understood the many small things that had puzzled her for years. “You’ve learned to join that, Mari, haven’t you?” she said.
“I always knew. When you and father mother would swim with me inside you before I was born, I wasn’t just learning to entangle with you.”
“So we are the only two people on this entire planet who are not part of this constant organic waveform?” Flier asked, her head tilted back and beak open with incredulity. She laughed a deep, long laugh.
“What’s so funny?” Anti asked.
“Here I am, having served for centuries as head of the Guardians, this grand, self-important, galaxy wide association of highly intelligent species, and after 30 years here, I had not noticed that in the very place where I live, evolution has taken another jump. That the technology that makes the Guardians work is not even needed here. If that’s not funny, I don’t know what is.”
They all laughed. Diver was happy to see Flier peek out from the laconic nest she had lived in since arriving here.
“Yes, sometimes we are just straight lines for that cosmic joker, the universe, eh?” Diver said. “But that’s extraordinary news. What does it mean?”
“A few things,” Mari said. “One, there’s hope that this is not an isolated ability that just Adno’s people have. There’s me, and…”
“There’s me,” Anti said. “When I was little, and Mari just born, I also became part of their waveform through her.”
“Anything else you want to tell us while we’re revealing secrets you’ve kept for decades?” Diver asked, trying not to be annoyed.
“Yes, some other things,” Anti said.
“Well, let’s get it straight from the source,” Mari said.
They felt Adno’s presence.
“I apologize for keeping you in the dark, Diver who is my mentor and Flier who is my hero,” she said. “But I had my reasons. When I brought you here, it was because I had learned that Hanikori had actually assembled a shadow organization within the Guardians, and that they had a plan that was secret from us. I was concerned that they might have developed capabilities like my people that would allow them to mine your knowledge. So I thought it best to protect you from this knowledge.”
“We would never have told them,” Flier said, angry and disappointed that her loyalty would be questioned.
“No, of course not,” Adno said, pausing to consider her next words. “But you might not have known you were being probed.”
“Are you saying they can entangle with us without our knowledge?” Flier asked.
“Maybe. We can. But we rarely do — we consider it immoral under most circumstances.”
“Most circumstances? When would it be moral?” Diver asked.
“When the giant killer endor fish come from the deep for us, we do not ask whether they are hungry. We know their minds and act accordingly.”
“And Hanikori?” Flier asked. “Is he coming from the deep for us?”
“Not for you, just yet, but for the humans,” she answered. “If he can finish them off, he can empty the Guardian’s plate, as you land dwellers like to say, of any duties tending to emergent civilizations. Right now, he hides behind Green, who is of two minds, but one mind is weak and doesn’t stand up to the other. They think I do not know, that I am a silly fish who is too dumb to leave the water. They cannot see that my mind can swim everywhere they can walk or fly. And then some.”
“Where do you see them flying to?” Mari asked, prodding her to tell her parents.
“I have been careful to limit my secret entanglements with them, so I haven’t been able to fully understand that. There are layers. They will tell the Council that Earth is hopeless and that I should be reassigned. But I know that is not the whole truth. They are planning something else, something that Hanikori will use as an example to redirect the Council’s work.”
“Redirect it to what?” Flier asked.
“That is what I do not know. When you were forced to resign, I sensed that he was very pleased that you were compromised over the issue of inducing entanglement in Lina.”
“How did you know about that?” Flier asked. She had never told anyone but Diver about that.
“Let’s just say I was able to eavesdrop on fragments of discussions he had with Green and Putnomo. Please, I would have done the same as you, so I’m not judging you. But I think the reason he is pleased is that by letting it leak that you had done that, he drew attention away from his plans to do much more than that, and with many more humans. While he was hammering away at you over Lina, he himself had already entangled with several humans, posing as another human named Hank. He nearly had Raefe killed — we had to help Lina organize an escape from his home rock to her home rock. But I’ve not been able to track Hank recently.”
Diver began to feel her resentment rising that she had been kept out of the loop for so long, but then felt the anger that rose in Far Flier now. For so long, Far Flier had suppressed her response to the humiliation and defeat that Hanikori had dealt her. Now that he had been unmasked as a total liar and hypocrite, Flier felt no reason to rein in her feelings.
“And Earth? Raefe and Lina? Des and Nyssa? The other, weaker entanglers?” Diver asked. “What will happen to them?”
“We are making plans with Raefe and Lina,” Adno said. “Already, we have been able to make a school of 10,000 humans, thousands of them entangled. And 100 of them acting as a single mind, charting the way forward. We will not abandon them.”
“She means that Raefe and Lina have been part of a large group of refugees,” Des said. “Even as we speak, they are holding a gathering of 10,000 people from around the world to figure out a plan to change their world.”
Diver felt the joy of that. “I am so happy to hear that. And happy for Raefe. I remember that he was nearly mad from the voices he heard before he understood his abilities. I have followed your reports, Adno, for years. And talked to Raefe and Lina now and then. But this is a giant step forward for them. Maybe a new step forward for the humans. This is wonderful news. You have done wonders, Adno.”
“And we’re behind you. Whatever we can do. We won’t let Hank or whatever Hanikori hides behind destroy it,” Flier said. “Hanikori will no longer glide unharried on the currents, free to dive for his prey whenever he wants. In a few years, I will breed as a female. I will birth an army, if it takes that, to stop him.”
Diver smiled. Usually she was the one to call up such ancient images. Flier was calling on inner strengths, and Diver knew she had many. Hanikori would come to regret what he had done to Far Flier, of that Diver was sure.

Traveller’s Perch
October 10, 2081
“Do you remember sitting here 30 years ago, when we began our project of reforming the Guardians,” Hanikori asked, waving at the plaza in front of them. It was a cloudy day, no suns visible in the sky. But it was a pleasant temperature, and people were walking about, smiling, talking.
“I do,” Green said, “while we sipped bitter tea. And worried that Far Flier would find out.”
“You were worried about him?”
“Weren’t you? He embodied the Guardians back then.”
“And then he didn’t,” Hanikori reminded him.
“He seems to have removed himself from the Guardian waveform,” Green conceded.” Not just the Council, but the whole organization. It’s been years since I felt his signature in the waveform.”
“Yes, his vaunted dedication seemed to decline rapidly once he lost control of the organization,” Hanikori said. “Just as well. He would only have been a hindrance these past years. Speaking of which, I have some ideas I want to bring up at the next Guardian Council. I wanted to get your reaction first, though.”
“I’m all ears.” Green found Hanikori’s fake inclusiveness tiresome. He would do what he wanted to do, and the rest was pretense.
“It’s time that we transform the Earth project to be one of active stewardship,” said Hanikori, “not passive monitoring. If your department was focused on finding the timelines where we could be most effective, we could also periodically nudge civilizations through occasional gifts of technology and knowledge.”
“You want to remove the ban on active interference from our activities? Do you think the council will go for that?”
“Yes, with your support and Putnomo’s, we’ll have the votes. He’s already on onboard.”
“Well, you know you have my support. But what about the Ambassadors? And Earth?”
Hanikori smiled. “Dear old Earth. The 20 most advanced civilizations in the Galaxy have spent the last 130 years worrying about that odd little lot. Quite remarkable.”
“They’ve felt like that one little child in the nursery who just won’t learn their lessons.”
“Well, you have more experience with children than me, but that seems apt,” Hanikori said with a hint of the distaste that the subject of procreation usually brought to him.
“Do you see just cutting off the whole project?”
“No, no,” Hanikori said. “We owe them something, I feel. We’ve mucked about in their affairs on and off, probably done more harm than good. But we can bring it to a successful conclusion.”
Green was intrigued by Hanikori’s oblique reference to his failures on Earth. “Are they a difficult people, is that it? Did you find them that way?”
“Me? No, not at all,” Hanikori said as if surprised. “I was thinking of the mess Diver made. But I think we have some things in place, and some hidden reserves.”
“Oh?” Always drama with Hanikori, he thought. Just get on with it.
“Well, first there’s Adno, the fish who took Diver’s place.”
Green was slightly taken aback at “fish.” Adno was from a race every bit as intelligent as theirs. “Fish” was what they ate for dinner. “How do you mean?”
“Adno’s people are water dwellers. They exist as schools. Humans live on land, they exist as individuals in very loose and conflicting groups. She is, if you will pardon the pun, out of her depth with them,” Hanikori said, laughing at his own joke.
“Funny,” Green smiled back. “So you’re suggesting that if I leave her alone, the whole thing will eventually just, as it were, fall into the ocean?”
“Undoubtedly,” Hanikori said. “But that is not actually what I was thinking. We should lead by example, don’t you think? If we can bring the Earth project to a quick and successful conclusion, we will silence lingering doubts among the Guardians.”
“And your plan for that is?”
“Contrary to popular belief, I did not spend my time as ambassador to Earth wandering around in ignorance. I admit that the Korean initiative backfired badly. But I put in place initiatives that are just now bearing fruit. For example, one of the most powerful men on Earth now considers it commonplace to converse with a voice in his head named Hank. He’s grown quite fond of Hank, and values his advice highly. Why not — I’ve given him knowledge no one else on Earth has, and it’s made him fabulously rich. Of course, he doesn’t know that Hank is an alien from an advanced civilization 20 light years distant.”
Green stared at him for a moment, absorbing the notion that Hanikori had been secretly involved somehow in Earth for over 100 years. Every time he wanted to trust the man, something like this caused him the deepest of doubts.
“You are troubled,” Hanikori said. “You think it was wrong of me to do this on my own. But I have always been clear that leaders must lead, from wherever they can. This is not about me. I turn this over to you with no reservation.”
“And what is it you want me to do?”
“You will sense in my mind a number of different numbers. You will also sense some other data. The numbers you will recognize as coordinates, but they are encrpyted. If you think of the data and the numbers together, the actual coordinates will resolve. Only you can do that — certain aspects of your brain waves that are unique to you form a private key. Anyway, if you go to that location, you will find all the information you will need to carry on.”
What more secrets does this man hide, thought Green. He would have to find that out. For now, he was very curious about what Hanikori had in mind for Earth.</Text>

Newcastle, Republic of Northern England
December 22, 2081

The Urban Gypsies had the rooftops, the Northern Guard the alleys, while the citizens of Newcastle walked the main streets, unaware that a battle between them might break out any minute. 
“You see the Guards over on the east side of that big building?” asked Gordon Brown, the Gypsies’ leader. He handed Raefe the binoculars. “They’re the real problem. The rest are just wankers, but those guys are hardcore.”
Raefe looked, but he had already felt the harsh glare of violent energy coming from the small groups Gordo was pointing to. How many times in the last 30 years had he witnessed a band of desperate armed people filled with that exact feeling? Some, like the Gypsies around him, gave off a more complex set of emotions: hope that by fighting they could end fighting, longing to wake up without the feeling of threat all around them. 
But many, like these die hards from the Northern Guard, had drunk the cocktail of violence and power that seemed to be the unofficial drink of a society dissolving all around him. It was all too easy to put a gun in someone’s hands and all too easy for armed bands to believe that guns inoculated them from the end of the world as they knew it. 
If only they could all experience the warm ties that bound people together in the Free Alliance. But that’s what he was here for, to bring them into the fold. He turned to the Gypsies that were with him.
“We talked about how to sense people’s emotions. Can any of you feel what’s going on inside their heads?”
“Don’t know as I want to,” said Claire, a compact little woman of about 35. “Bloody scary what’s in their heads.”
Raefe smiled to himself. They were new at this. Blood scary indeed. They couldn’t read the Northern Guards’ thoughts — neither could he. But they could read their feelings. Well, eventually. He remembered the first time he had felt someone else’s feelings. It was supremely odd, yet there was also a sense of familiarity. You thought, oh my, no one else thinks like me. But eventually you found the greater truth: our feelings are unique in the same way as our appearance. No two people look alike, but plenty of people resemble each other. Like one of those police sketch kits — you could make up almost anyone’s face by assembling a handful of bits from a few dozen choices. Feelings were the same way, if a bit more expansive and complex.
He had read a 20th century novel that had a scene where a child draws a picture. This took place before puters, and the girl had to use a piece of paper instead. And she didn’t have a light pen with a color wheel. Apparently back then they gave little children pen-shaped pieces of colored wax. They would come in sets. This little girl had a set with 12 different colors (why did 20th century people have all these ways of counting that had to do with 4 or 6 or 12? Did it have something to do with the calendar?) so she couldn’t draw all the flowers in the garden properly. She wanted the box with 88 colors. With 88 colors she could draw most anything and it would look real.
He had found that most people had about 100 emotions, but even then, they were related in groups. But the difference between any two people was not just which color and how strong each  was, but how one could amplify another, or tamp another down, or, well, even after all these years, he hadn’t really figured it all out. Everything affected everything, that he knew — they were all woven together, more like a tapestry than a drawing. Or maybe more like an electronic circuit, each component affecting the others in nonlinear ways.
Nonetheless, he had become fluent in the nuance of human emotions, and to the extent that the heart and the head were aligned, it helped him greatly to understand what other people were thinking. And so he had been able to understand how his own actions could change other people’s thoughts and feelings, and that had made him more confident in his ability to communicate. And he knew this would happen to all of them, in time. Right now, though, they were doing well to be at the 12-crayon stage.
“I know, that’s our first reaction,” Raefe said. “And maybe it is scary, but unless you start to understand what makes them tick, your choices are to ignore them or kill them. Both have unpleasant consequences.”
“Well, at least killing them is effective,” Irish Liam said. “I could take a couple of them out from here, Gordo, take ‘em right off the board. Wouldn’t that be best?”
“Is it?” Raefe responded sharply, intervening before Gordo made a snap judgment. “Because they have mothers and brothers and children, and they’ll grow up to hate you. Surely, you’ve seen that already.”
“Aye,” Gordo said. “Can’t argue with that. Half of us are here because of what they did to our families in the past. Let’s take a pass, Liam. We’ll get our chance soon enough, I’m sure.”
“The one in the blue shirt,” Claire said. “She’s full of anger, no… more vengence. And deep grief, too. Now and then, a fond remembrance — maybe a lover? No, maybe a relative, images of a boy, maybe a brother. All stewed up together. Very intense, that feeling.”
“You’re wondering what it means,” Raefe said. “Maybe he lost a brother to a rival gang or in one of McDornish’s campaigns. She wants payback. Worth noting that as vague as it seems to you, it’s not much more rational to her. Just a feeling she lives with, all the time.”
A few blocks a way, some gunfire erupted as another group of Gypsies stumbled into a Guard patrol in an alley. Raefe could sense emotions spiking at the sound of gunfire.
“I can feel their fear,” Ganesh said. “Deep fear. So many layers of fear. They’ve been afraid since they were little berns.”
“That’s what I’ve often found,” Raefe said. “People who live in tough places live in fear constantly. It’s not obvious because they mask it by being scary themselves. But it has deep consequences.”
Before he could continue, more gunfire erupted and closer to them. The Gypsies returned fire across the now deserted streets. Raefe lay still on his side behind the low wall at the edge of the roof, hoping the brick would deflect any bullets. After a few minutes, the Guard decided they had had enough and headed back toward their own turf in central Newcastle. Gordo herded them all back to the dark, deserted streets where the Gypsies had their headquarters in an abandoned warehouse. They all collapsed on a bunch of old sofas strewn around in the second floor room that passed for their headquarters.
“I see how the Guard roam the city,” Raefe said. “It’s intimidating most of the people, although obviously not you guys.”
“We can give as well as we get. But right now, we’re up against it,” said Gordo. “When Brian McDornish came on the scene in ‘63, he promised the North a new start and heaven and earth in the bargain. Five years after the split from the South, he’s nowhere near that, but he’s also had time to push his opponents off the stage. That’s let him keep his failures in Northern England pretty quiet. So people still have faith in him.”
“When you say people have faith,” Raefe asked, “what do you think they see to have faith in? Him? His movement? His worldview?”
“Mostly, they fear what he says he fears,” Gordo said. “After this afternoon, though, maybe I’m changing my mind. Maybe they were already afraid, and he tells them what of. Anyway, his support comes mainly from two communities — the old British Anglo-Saxons and the Hindu Nationalists. You know we had the big riots between Hindus and Muslims in ‘74, and McDornish took control during that. Basically, he’s made an alliance between the old Brits and the Hindu Nationalists against the Muslims and the Euros.”
“But not just that,” Claire said. Despite her very black skin, she had a thick Scottish accent. “I came down from Glasgow after ‘74 because of what McDornish said about the corpos. It’s not just blacks who followed him for that, either.”
“It’s true,” Liam said. “All my old mates from the docks are McDornish supporters. More than that — half of them are muscle for him. They think he’s the man who can show those poshies in London that they don’t run the world.”
“And yet, he uses so many of their methods,” Raefe said. “Divide and conquer, intimidate, buy off.”
“That’s where we’re stuck,” said Gordo. “The Urban Gypsies stand for the urban poor who have no permanent homes, no place in the scheme of things. There’s millions in the Newcastle area and tens of millions in all of Northern England who fit that description. But he’s got them more worried about the 30% who are Muslims. It’s easy for him to rant against the Corpos — they’re on the other side of the border. But real action — he’s got the other 30% who are Hindus fighting the Muslims, and the whites cheering them on.”
“It’s rubbish, what he tells the Hindus,” Ganesh said. “Me and my brother Mikey, we were street kids in Little Mumbai in ‘74. McDornish recruited us to be soldiers for him. Filled our heads with all this nonsense about being real Brits. Me and Mikey and our mates — we weren’t even against the Muslims. Played football with ‘em, some of us had Muslim girlfriends. But he made it seem like real Northerners, they wouldn’t stand for them, so get with it.”
“What changed your mind?” Raefe asked.
“Court Street Community Center,” Mikey said. “I mean, the whole thing was daft — like some  kids playing vids after school were a threat to the nation. I watched those white boys cheering while the place burned, those Muslim kids trapped inside. I felt in my heart they would  do the same for some other brown boys like me and Ganesh when it suited them. All that talk of how we could be real Northerners, like we weren’t already. Born and bred, is me and Ganesh.”
Raefe could feel the anger and tension in the room. How many rooms had he sat in like this the last 30 years? The frustration of the dispossessed.
“Well, I think the Urban Gypsies are on the right track.” Raefe said. “You’ve made common cause between all parties. And McDornish can’t deliver — the old ways aren’t going to solve what we’re facing. And you’re about the new ways — the new economics of social profit, human benefit.”
“What you said about fear  — how do we fight that?” Claire asked. “All well and good for people to get jobs that put a few quid in their pocket without destroying the planet. All for it. But what about the hate?”
 “You understand this will take generations, right?” Raefe said. “Look, it’s a piano tune we have to learn to play. The left hand is fighting for what you see — food, housing, the rest. The right hand is what you can feel — we’re not each other’s enemy, we don’t have to all love each other to stop hating each other. It’s a war of inches and years. That’s why I came here — I hope you’ll become part of the Free Alliance.”
“Tell us more about what the Alliance is doing,” Gordo said. “We only get sketchy reports here.”
Raefe gave them his standard rundown. How Citizens of Nowhere came to be. How they joined forces with the New Voodo Army, which was really the start of the Free Alliance. How he had roamed the world since 2050, seeking out like-minded people.
“At this point, we have thousands of small groups like this, all over the world. What we have found is that in the corners of society, away from the money and the Net buzz and whatnot, the old society is dissolving. Often the first result is gangs and terror. But after that burns itself out, people discover that the government and the big corpos don’t give a damn what they do. They see people like you and places like this as a waste of their resources.”
“Happened here, for sure,” Irish Liam said. “No one’s replaced a broken street light in living memory.”
“Exactly,” Raefe said. “But I if you go to Area 7 in Mumbai, you’ll see that the neighborhood now supplies its own streetlighting. The big software companies in Mumbai upgrade their solar panels to the newest tech every few years. Most of the workers at the recycling yards live in Area 7. About 10 years ago, they starting scavenging the panels and created the first solar/battery streetlighting network in the city’s history. People who agree to have a panel on their roof and maintain it get some of the power for free during the day. And then Area 7 went to the tech companies and worked out an agreement whereby the Area 7 teams replace the panels at the tech complexes every five years. In exchange for their labor, they get to keep the old ones. Then, through the Free Alliance, Area 7 gets technical assistance for many other things and contributes their know-how on street lighting. Many other member groups are now following their example.”
“Spiffy,” Irish Liam responded. “But what’s that got to do with us?”
“When the hardcore guys from the Northern Guard, go home, does their neighborhood look like this?”
“Pretty much,” Irish Liam said. “Most of the buildings are only partially habitable, or have no water or juice.”
“Tell me, anyone here have any ideas of what you could do about it?”
“Well, we’ve all got a few,” Gordo said. “But it’s pretty fucking complicated. Before the split with the South, the local corpos were pushing factory built houses that had standard plug ins for power, water, etc. That left out all that was trained to be builders — carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, etc. But some are still around. They could fix stuff up — if they had supplies and a reason to.”
“C’mon Gordo,” Ganesh said. “You know if we did that, the Guards would bomb the place.”
“And us to them,” Mikey said. “Let’s be honest.”
“And if you could get past that, learn to trust each other?”
“Be a cool day in Hell,” Irish Liam said.
“And that’s the other side of the Free Alliance,” Raefe said. “Combining new economics with a new social attitude — empathy. Starting from what share, not what divides us. I think you all got a taste of that out there today — once you were able to tune in to your enemies’ emotions, you all recognized them. Because you have many of the same feelings. There is no us versus them in the end — it’s only us versus us. We should be able to win that fight, don’t you think?” he said, hoping the little joke would open the door for them to agree. 
“It’s all spiffy, mate” said Claire. “But like in a dream, far off. What do we do tomorrow?”
“Whatever you can to disarm their fear,” Raefe said. “There’s no magic bullet. You must find ways to show most of them that you’re not the enemy they think you are. In time, as you strengthen your empathic abilities, you will learn to connect with them and they will actually be able to see into your hearts. Hopefully, that will be a good experience for them.” 
They all laughed, some a bit more nervously than others.
“At the same time,” he continued, “you can’t just surrender to their threats. Some of them are truly past reasoning with; they’re addicted to violence, and them, you have to oppose. And you can keep reminding them that McDornish can’t deliver. But ultimately, we all have to start to focus on the corpos.” 
“Much as I despise them, they’re not shooting at us. And we can’t avoid buying from them — they make most everything. Except a good brown ale!” Gordo laughed.
“Don’t kid yourselves. The corpos have their claws into McDornish. They push him to suppress the Gypsies. Where do you think he gets all his intelligence from?”
“So you think we need to storm the City down in London?” Claire asked.
“No, they’re too clever for that,” Raefe answered. “They’ve scattered around the globe. I’ve worked for 30 years to make them an endangered species. Urban Gypsies are not alone. Citizens of Nowhere are the most advanced part of the Fee Alliance, and it frightens them  —millions of Africans taking themselves out of the global market, creating an alternative ethical economy, generating our own energy from wind and sun, and so on. And it’s not public yet, but Holland is going to take a huge step — you know about Everywhere?”
They shook their heads.
“Holland is going to become the first virtual nation. Most of their land will be underwater in another 50 years anyway. So they’re offering citizenship to anyone anywhere in their new virtual nation, Everywhere. If you pay their 10% income tax, you’ll be a Citizen of Everywhere. They’ll give you a passport and social benefits and protection of basic human rights. You get a vote for their parliament. While there is room, you can live in Holland, but you don’t have to. They don’t say it, but they hope other  states will merge with Everywhere and increase their ability to absorb people. The corpos are irritated. They thought they could just absorb the old nation states and do away with all of that, but Holland has refused to play.”
“Wow, that could be the start of something for sure. How do you think the corpos will respond?” Gordo asked, looking cautiously interested.
“We’re working on finding out. But I expect that their first play will actually be against traditional governments. They’re weaker every day, and they still have more people than Everywhere.”
“Excuse me,” said a small, dark skinned girl, perhaps Persian. “I hate to interrupt, but I’ve just been monitoring the Northern England military frequencies, and there’s something you need to hear.”
“Go ahead, Ea,” Gordo said. “Raefe, Ea is our best hacker and electronics ace.”
“Thanks, Gordo,” she said, slightly embarassed. “Look, the long and short of it is that the military have gotten reports from Iceland and Norway that the Gulf Stream inversion we always feared has finally happened. For five straight days, the surface temperature in the ocean north of here has been dropping.”
“What’s happened?” Raefe asked.
“Well, they’re not saying,” Ea replied, “but most likely a major piece of ice sheet has fallen off of Greenland. This is what everyone’s feared for years — the fresh water has submerged the water salt water coming up from Africa and South America.”
“What’s the weather report?” Mikey asked.
“That’s why I’m interrupting you,” Ea said. “Iceland weather reports massive storms forming out at sea. Basically, a snow hurricane is headed our way, along with a 10 or more degree drop in temperatures. Early indications suggest more than a meter of snow, possibly much more. We won’t see the sun for weeks.”
For an instant, Raefe felt that awful cold wind blasting his face on Truro Island, the last thing he had ever felt in that timeline. He shuddered, realizing that the time that the Guardians had bought him and Lina was now almost up. In only 30 years, this world had come to the same point as that other Earth. They would not have long to get to some kind of global higher ground.

Dadaab
September 21, 2081

Lina looked out across the plain of Dadaab. Ten thousand sets of eyes looked back at her from a sea of faces of every sort. The First Worldwide Congress of the Dispossessed was about to start and you didn’t have to be an empath to feel the high expectations.
“Did you ever expect to see this?” she asked Raefe, squeezing his hand.
“Some days, yes. But not that many,” he acknowledged, smiling. “And the best part is, we don’t know all of these people. There are so many new groups represented here, from so many parts of the world.”
A band played “Wet Feet on Desert Sands,” the song that had become the anthem of fugees everywhere. Voices rose slowly until there were ten thousand people singing as one:

We leave our homes
In the sea
We walk the streets
With wet feet
Our feet water the deserts
That we meet
We are the future
That we greet
Hey, Ho, Forward We Go!
Over the din, the amplified voice of Lina’s old friend Edna could be heard.
“Welcome, delegates to this congress and people of the new world! I am Edna, of the Council of Nowhere.  For so many years, we have wandered in the deserts and marshes, wondering where our homes would be.  After more than 30 years, more than 1 billion people roam the world, each step bringing them to a new home.”
The crowd had hushed now, letting the weight of a billion fugees sink in.
“The old homes, that we had in the old world, are gone,” Edna said. “Many of you never lived in that old world, before the ice melted, before the seas rose, before the rains stopped coming. So you feel the truth of what I am about to say: that we will never have that home in that world again. 
“So what is this new world, and where is our home in it?” she continued. “That is what we are here to discuss, and hopefully, decide. You can see I am an old woman. And I have spent my life almost entirely in the ashes of the old world, as have many of you. Now it is time for us to remember the story of the Phoenix, who rose from the ashes to fly again. Those who have turned this world into ashes, they have lost their right to tell us how to live. It is our time to decide that for ourselves.
“All around the world, new ways have emerged from the disasters of the last 30 years. Here in Africa, the Citizens of Nowhere, who originally arose in East Africa, merged our new model of citizenry with the New Voodoo Army’s new economy in Nigeria in the 2050s. Since then, our ranks have swelled to 70 million people across Africa who have their own economy, their own social institutions, and their own homes in the wastelands deserted by the profiteers, false prophets and thieves who moved on to easier plunder.
“Some of you come from Southeast Asia, where you have had to give up the rice paddies that your ancestors worked for 2,500 years. More than 400 million people from Shanghai to Bangladesh now live only in boats. Almost 50 million of them belong to the Rising Tide, a water-borne equivalent to Citizens of Nowhere. And just as the New Voodo Army changed Nigeria from a toxic chemical dump to a livable place, Rising Tide is changing the way fishing is done, restoring the coastlines and seas of Asia to a sustainable state. And all without the involvement of the corpos who seek to profit from our hardships.
“Change is not just coming from fugees. From Europe and the Americas, we have seen experiments in the concept of social profit and cost. The Urban Gypsies of the Republic of Northern England create viable communities in the poor neighborhoods of that economically ravaged republic. Recently, a much more prosperous piece of what was once known as the Kingdom of the Netherlands became a global republic, accepting citizens wherever they live, no matter they’re history. You pay taxes, they offer to protect your human rights and provide basic social benefits, totally upending centuries of what the nation state has been.
“After decades of plundering the Amazon and fostering toxic urban poverty, the elites of Brazil were forced by mass action to comply with a completely new political economy, neither capitalism nor socialism, but combining aspects of both. Will it work? Time will tell, as it will for the new nations forming in Europe and North America that are neither run by the old elites nor one of the new corporate states. For us here, now, it is yet another example of how we might choose to go.”
She talked for a while longer about how the conference would work, and soon the crowd broke up into discussion groups. Edna stood apart, deep in thought.
“You’ve all done a great job in bringing everyone together,” Raefe’s thoughts found her.
“All in one place, at least,” Edna said. “Now the work of bringing them together begins.”
Raefe wandered through the crowd. For 30 years, he had traveled to meet groups large and small who were desperate for deep and fundamental change. He had listened to their grievances, their hopes for the future. He brought them news of Nowhere and all the other groups popping up in the shadows of the world world, all around the globe. In every place, he had also met others with empathic potential and if they were willing, he had helped them to learn entanglement. With Adno’s help, he had located thousands of potentials and been able to help most over the threshold to be able to use and control their empathic powers. The day was drawing near when their combined power could sustain a global waveform.
Still, few here knew what he looked or sounded like. Outside of Dadaab and the Nigerian village that he and Lina had lived in for awhile, Raefe had carefully avoided the limelight. His skill as an empath had not just enabled him to communicate more deeply with people — it had also shown him how many people feared such closeness. Sometimes their fear could lead to violence. But not here — today he was among friends.
He sat quietly on the edge of a group from North America as they compared their experiences and shared their ideas on a way forward.
“We live on the new coast,” a young woman said. “Our town used to be the hilly section of a big city that was part of the old state of Connecticut. Now there are only a few hundred buildings left standing above water. You can walk down the main street right into Long Island Sound. You can go inland from our town, but not up or down the coast — we’re cut off by bays both north and south.”
Raefe had a fleeting image of East Somerville, water rushing between the stanchions of an elevated highway, before he and Lina had been transferred to this timeline.
“How long have you lived like that?” he asked. He noticed that her shoulders were tattoed with a riot of colorful birds done in smart ink that changed colors in a complex, repeating pattern. It was a design that had been popular about 10 years ago, and the smart ink suggested that she had once lived a very comfortable life.
“For three years,” she said.
“What’s your situation now?”
“Strange,” she replied. “Connecticut no longer exists — most of it was ceded to DigiBrands in exchange for managing a long list of potential disasters. But they don’t want us because we have nothing of value to them. We’re more No One than Nowhere.”
Raefe smiled. “How about Someone Somewhere?”
She laughed. “Some Some, then. I like that. Anyway, there’s a large farmer’s cooperative about 200 kilometers north, along the Connecticut River. With the new weather, that’s actually a very fertile area now. We buy food from them, and smuggle it in to avoid DigiBrand’s taxes. We think in a few years, the sunken town will become like a reef, so we’re investing in fishing gear and shellfish farming supplies. At least we’d be able to feed ourselves.”
“The rest of you, what’s your biggest need?” Raefe asked. “Food, water, shelter, power, or services like education and healthcare? And tell us who you are, please.”
“All of it,” shouted a wiry young man from the back. “I’m Karl, from Pittsburgh, still part of Pennsylvania, still part of what’s left of the United States of America. Which are not united, and not very much of America. Anyway, we should have it good. The rivers are full and we got hydro off of them. We got farmland in every direction, and the warming’s actually improved our growing. But that’s attracted too much attention.”
“How so?” Raefe asked. Karl was an unremarkable young black man, hair cut in the current fashion of thin orange sides, a braided row circling the back of his head, and a paintbrush wedge of curls standing up on top. Raefe noticed a triangle tatto on his neck; it was from some prison in the U.S., he couldn’t recall which.
“We got the New Confederacy in what was West Virginia. They’re hooked up with Billy Warren, who’s basically taken over the old Koch empire. They actually tried to blow up one of our dams to force us back to coal! Warren’s got other friends in Ohio and they try to control the movement of food on the roads. We had good contacts with some farmer’s coops south of Cleveland, but now Warren’s people want us to pay exit fees for the food to leave Ohio. And then there’s some biker gangs roaming through western PA — sometimes they ride into neighborhoods on the edge of Pittsburgh and just take whatever they can. All down the line, we’re dealing with this kind of shit.”
“What’s your plan to fix this?” a middle aged man demanded of Raefe.
“You’re the plan,” Raefe smiled. “This is the plan.” He waved his arm toward all of the other small groups.
“You brought us here just to talk?” the man said, incredulous. “I came for answers. I’m ready to fight, even to die. But not for nothing.”
“You’re Walt, right?” Raefe said. “I’m Raefe.”
“I know who you are,” Walt said.
“When you were a boy, Walt, did you learn about the fall of the Roman Empire in school?” Raefe asked.
“Sure. The barbarians destroyed them. Not so different than us, eh?”
“Just so,” Raefe answered. “You think any one of those Roman emperors that lived in 200 or 300 could have had a plan to stop that? No, because the Roman Empire just couldn’t work anymore. It was too big, too dependent on conquest and slavery. That’s our world — it doesn’t work anymore. It’s too big and too broken for a plan. No one knows what’s next.”
“So what the hell are we doing here?” a   woman in her late 40s yelled out. “I’m Connie. We’re close to the edge out where I’m from. We’ve got people on all sides trying to crush us. We could have people hunting us for food in a generation.”
Raefe could feel her fear. He could tell her that he had spent time with many gangs like the ones she feared, and that cannibalism was not their first option. But he had learned that fear made people blind and deaf. He hoped she could someday learn to read emotions, and she would understand that while she had many things to fear, being eaten was not one of them. Not for many generations.
“We’re doing what we can,” Raefe responded. “I don’t think cannibalism is an immediate threat. But here in Africa, we’ve spent 30 years beating back the kinds of threats you may face soon in North America. You probably already face them on a small scale: Karl’s bikers are like the pirates and raiders that plague Africa. We’ve dealt with human traffickers who scoop young girls by the village full to sell to corpos and gangsters.  Water pirates who seize a dam or pumping station and demand ransom or no water.”
“Well, that’s reassuring,” Connie said, deep with sarcasm. Suddenly, Raefe understood where she was coming from. She had been genetically engineered, probably back in the ‘60s, when it was all the rage among the middle classes. Supposed to make them more competitive with the corpo kids, but the tech just succeeded in unbalancing people. After a long legal battle, the biotech companies behind it had agreed to reverse the effects, but people were still left with odd personalities.
“Look,” Raefe said. “We may not know all of what comes next, but we do know a few things. We need an economy that doesn’t keep driving the temperature up. We need a governance system that doesn’t let people who have a vested interest in the old ways obstruct the new, while we figure that out. And with so many people’s lives shattered, we need a culture that prevents us from fighting over the remnants, as much as possible. And then we cycle back to the economy — it also has to help the fugees. And so on. So what have you tried? What do you want to try? What do you know of what people who aren’t here are doing that’s worth considering?”
“That’s all good, but until then how are we going to keep those NeoCons from killing the 60% of Pittsburgh they consider inferior beings?” Karl asked.
“In the New Voodoo Army, we learned that guns are only a temporary help,” Raefe said. “We’ve learned that you can disarm your opponent, but until you’ve disarmed their fear and the hatred it enables, you haven’t done anything. We’ll spend a whole day on that later in the week.”
“I don’t hear any urgency from you,” Walt said. “What can we do now?”
“I’ll tell you how urgent this is to me,” Raefe said. “I’ve spent thirty years working toward this week. Pretty much every day of that thirty years, too. And I can’t make it all go away for you, even after thirty years. We have to start thinking differently, stop pretending that our problems just need the right magic spell to fix, the right shortcut on our vid game controller. We have to change history. We have to change the way we live. And the way we live with each other. Thirty years is like 30 seconds for that. But we have to start.”
“True ‘nuff,” Karl said. “But start what?”
“Right now, we need people who are willing to try new ways of living. We need people who will commit to new arrangements that don’t make the climate worse, that don’t aggravate racism and ethnic strife, that don’t enforce patriarchy and so on. When they find ways that work, we need them to defend them, yes, but also to continue evolving and refining what they do. And we need  people to commit knowing it may not work, knowing in a few years they may have to start all over, in a completely new way. That nothing is certain and everything is up for grabs. Humanity must travel on a long and dangerous voyage to another planet — sustainable Earth. We need people with that kind of courage and commitment.”
Raefe could sense their excitement, but also continued skepticism, all mixed with the lingering fear that their daily lives now brought. We have to send them home with more than that, he thought, and set off to learn more from the delegates.

            <Text>Just a few enhancements
September 19, 2081
Hanikori reached the back of the cave and found the boulder that stood a meter in front of another passage. Unless you were standing right next to the back of the boulder, you couldn’t see the opening. And from back here, you couldn’t see the front of the cave. So no one would know where he would disappear to, even if they had managed to follow him to the mouth of the cave without him knowing it.
He remembered the day 30 years ago that he had gathered 17 of the Guardians to plan e12 here, the chaotic energy of the lava below a natural shield against prying minds. Amazingly, they had been able to keep their  secret through all of this time. But they still had a long way to go on the immortality project, and he wasn’t going to relax just yet. For the next phase, he had to have access to test subjects on Earth. And he needed Putnomo to do a few things that would enable that.
Using the techniques that Putnomo had shown him those many years ago,  he initiated his own waveform in the secret subchannel that Putnomo had created to link the Wormhole Interface Network and found the scientist on his world 453 lights years distant.
“How goes the work on e12?” Hanikori asked.
“Slowly, I must admit,” Putnomo answered. “We can all be recreated as waveforms in plasma — we’ve mastered that technology. But allowing us to manipulate the material world in that state — we have big obstacles, still.”
“Yes, yes, it’s hard. I get that. But have you made any progress?”
“Yes, in the sense that we’ve ruled out our third approach. We have four more to try — will any of them provide a reliable mechanism? And then we have to engineer a way to do it easily.”
“And a timetable?” Hanikori asked.
“No less than ten years,” Putnomo said. “I wish I had better news.”
“I’m not surprised, given the difficulties so far. All the more reason my next request becomes important.”
“What’s that?”
“I’d like you to develop a package of enhancements for the humans. Life expectancy, 1,000 years. Ability to entangle with other enhanced beings without our help. You can absorb some of the minor details.” He opened his mind to allow Putnomo to scan them.
“You want me to enhance the human race?” Putnomo asked, incredulously.
“Of course not,” Hanikori said. “I want to be able to enhance a handful of humans. Really, only one to start with.”
“And how will you deliver it?”
“You’ll have to give me instructions on building and deploying the enhancements that I can transfer through the waveform to an individual person there. Then they have to be able to find people to make what you describe.”
“Hanikori, you might as well ask me to tell one of the birds that fly above your world how to become you. There are layers and layers of technology that humans have no inkling of that would go into extending their lives for 1,000 years.”
“Damn it, Putnomo, do you always have to draw everything out, complain about how impossible it is? I’ve entrusted you with our science program. Can you deliver? I’ll give you a week to come up with something.”
He waited awhile after breaking off with Putnomo, gathering his thoughts. The scientist always annoyed him with his insistence that everything was hard, that everything would take a long time. They both were in their seventh century yet that made him impatient for change and Putnomo deliberate and tiresome. But he was the key to the e12 immortality project, so Hanikori would just have to put up with him, despite his veiled threat to dismiss him. Let him worry, Hanikori thought, even though he had no intention of letting go of Putnomo. Or of telling him how he would use the enhanced Earther.
Calmer now, he reached into the Wormhole Interface Network and found his subject asleep on Earth. He inserted himself into Billy Warren’s dream, a dull recounting of the prior day’s trip on one of Earth’s incredibly old-fashioned coal-powered trains. In the dream, Warren was sitting in a train car, looking out as the scenery passed by. Hanikori sat down next to him.
“Pretty, isn’t it?”
“Oh, hey, Hank, nice to see you again. Yeah, it’s something ain’t it. See those deer up on that ridge? Those Hot Earthers want to put windmills up there. Scare the damn deer off. Not on my watch!”
Hanikori suspected the deer only roamed the ridge in Warren’s dreams, the woods they roamed in actuality having been ravaged by rising temperatures and forest fires. But it was Warren’s fierceness of purpose and determination that made him attractive, whatever his other flaws. He could deal with Warren’s delusions later.
“Yeah, I know what you mean, Billy. There are a lot of small minds in the world. But I have something that I think could be what you like to call a game changer, Billy. I wanted to run it by you.”
He gave Billy a glimpse of being enhanced. How he would be virtually immortal, how he would be able to read other people’s thoughts at will, and hinted at more to come.
“Wow. Are you saying you can help me become like that, Hank?”
“Just so, Billy.”
“And why would you do that?”
“Because I believe in what you are trying to accomplish. And what you are doing requires time.”
“And what do you want in exchange?”
Hanikori smiled. Warren wasn’t exactly the sentimental type.
“Humanity is nearing its end. The planet can’t support billions more people. And the culture is lost in a mire of what you call egalitarianism, on the one hand, and blind tribal strife on the other. I know you know that not every person is equal, that some can see farther and accomplish more than others. And if humanity is to survive, it must recast itself based on those people. So I want you to start that process, to bring together other people like yourself, and with the knowledge that these gifts will be yours, develop a plan to reform Earth based on the best of you.”
“You’re right that we are mired in those things. Even among the elite, there’s no agreement about the way forward. But I have some ideas about a core group that could potentially accomplish this, especially if we have access to the things you promise.”
“You bring them together, and I’ll deliver,” Hanikori said, and broke the connection. Warren was so full of admiration for himself, but if Warren could deliver on his end, and Putnomo on his, Hanikori could finish the Guardian tradition of passive involvement. Immortality would not eliminate the need to monitor lesser species for impending threats. But this way, they could reliably transform worlds to reduce their threat to future generations. Maybe they’d blow themselves up down the road, but at least the Guardians would always have a backdoor into those worlds to neutralize them as a threat.
And the best part, he thought, was that he had Warren on the hook. When it came time to find subjects to test out Guardian immortality technology, he’d be in no position to say no.</Text>

Lina smiled to see Nyssa and Des sitting in one of the discussion groups, listening intently. She could feel their passion and their desire to speak, but they had learned long ago to listen first. That was the culture in Nowhere before she had arrived, and it had never wavered in the 30 years since.
“You must be proud,” she heard Fatima’s thoughts as the woman walked up behind and put her hands on shoulders. “Your children, now grown, now leaders.”
“Amazing, isn’t it,” she thought. “When Raefe came here in 2051, I had no thought of being a mother. I felt like I was already raising a child — myself. But the more time I spent with him, the idea grew on me. And then to have twins! But they are as much children of Nowhere as of Raefe and me. You and your mother and so many others taught them your way.”
“Our way,” Fatima corrected. “You forget how much we in Nowhere look up to you. I know you think of yourself as African, in some way, but when you came, you were the Chinese girl to everyone. And I mean everyone. The girl who walked away from power and domination to join us. And then her American boyfriend arrived and did the same. It was a powerful statement.”

And I mean everyone. The girl who walked away from power and domination to join us. And then her American boyfriend arrived and did the same. It was a powerful statement.”
“Maybe, but Raefe and I were no more than on the outskirts of our own worlds. Whatever privilege we had felt heavy and cumbersome, like a winter jacket on a summer day. A jacket we had borrowed to play dress up in. And our empathic abilities were far more interesting and alluring than the pull of our home worlds, if you know what I mean. Since then, Nowhere has absorbed millions of people who are only part African or not at all, for that matter. Your mother and Alton were much more key to that than me or Raefe.”
“Well, it’s a good thing we are all friends, then, eh?” Fatima laughed out loud and continued on, speaking out loud now. “Do you think we are close to trying our grand new experiment?”
“Let’s see what the organizing committee thinks.”
Lina reached out to the 10 people who were running the Congress. 
“Everyone,” she started. “How is the discussion going? Are we ready for our next phase?”
The discussions were going well, many ideas had come forth. Maybe not too many more would be, as there was a sense that they had reached that point where people were starting to repeat themselves. They all agreed that after three days, it was time to move to a consensus. Edna walked to the stage at the front.
“Friends,” she said. “Let’s take a break from our discussions. For three days, we have gone deeply into the problems we and the world face. Everyone has spoken, many ideas have been put on the table. But what we all want to know is, what can we do next? And we have a very innovative idea of how to figure that out. To explain, I want to ask Raefe Epstein-Miller to come up.”
Raefe had mostly stayed out of the limelight for the three days. He was surprised as he walked toward the stage by the loud cheers and clapping. By the time he got to the mic, all 10,000 people were standing and singing “Wet Feet.” Standing at the mic, looking out, he paused to try and understand what they were feeling.
“Thank you, thank you. I share your hopes, I agree with you that we are on the verge of something big and new and full of life. I accept your warmth and your thanks, and I can only say that I will do what I can to help us all fulfill the promise that we all carry with us. About 100,000 years ago, there were just about as many people here in Africa as there are here at this Congress today. Science tells us that they were far more interested in collaborating and learning from each other, in sharing their discoveries and in trading their secrets and their possessions, than they were in fighting over territory or mates. In their way, they understood that only together would they survive. It is incredible to me that for decades, powerful people who want us to believe that they are smarter than us have argued the opposite view.
“Those ancient people weren’t perfect. They did sometimes fight and even kill each other. But they seem to have never lost sight of their commonality. They never dismissed each other because of different customs or outlooks. In fact, they were hungry to meld their own rough sketch of life with other’s equally incomplete ideas. And that’s where we find ourselves here on Day 3 of the First Worldwide Congress of the Dispossessed, with various groups of people having worked out some thoughts, some partial plans. How do we move forward?
“When we planned this event, the 10-member committee that all of you elected to represent us debated this point longer than any other. One night, I had just come from one of these meetings and was sitting on a bench near my home, staring into space, trying to grapple with the challenge. A young man from my village stopped and we talked. Most of you know that many of the Citizens of Nowhere have learned to be empaths, to sense other’s thoughts, and to let them sense theirs. This young man is an empath and he asked me why we wouldn’t use that ability to create a platform that crystallized the true sense of the group. Often, in public gatherings and groups, the loudest or the smartest or simply the most persistent win the day. Maybe people who are none of those things have a better idea but no one has heard it. At that moment, I knew he was on to something.
“After much thought, we have come up with a process to move the discussion forward. We have ensured that every discussion group has contained a good number of empaths who have trained and developed their talent. They, in turn, have done what they can to understand those with less developed empathic abilities. And now, this group of about 100 empaths will meet for a few hours and share their thoughts with each other. For the first time in human history, we believe, a group large enough and diverse enough to capture the vast majority of thoughts and emotions will connect in a way that’s deep enough to actually reveal those thoughts and feelings in their fullness to each other.
“But first, I want to say what we, the organizing committee, have asked them to do. We have not asked them to come up with a list of tasks you can do or demands that you can take back home and fight for. No, that will not get us far. What we are trying to accomplish, what we need to accomplish, will take generations. And at the same time, we need to win improvements now, to alleviate suffering now, to halt further decline now.
“So we will be coming up with a set of principals and tests that can be applied to any proposed action or change. We will learn as we go which of these are more important than the others, but we will have a start. Are you ready to begin?”
The crowd left no doubt that they were. Raefe let their energy wash over him but he also probed further, trying to find the roots of their mood. They were optimistic, buoyed by their days together, hopeful. The Congress would be a success. But the next hours would determine whether it would be an historic occasion, though, or just an important one.</Text>

“As far as anyone knows,” Lina said, “This is the first time in human history that one hundred people have joined their minds together for a common purpose. Yes, we’ve all been to a concert or football match or some other event where everyone felt at one with everyone else there. But we will be attempting something more ambitious: creating a platform for the next phase of society. You have all been selected because you are high empaths, already able to entangle with others. For some of you, that is already an everyday thing. For others, a rare treat or even something you only suspected could happen. Regardless, no one here has ever done this. We will learn together.
“So let us begin with what keeps us alive — breathing. Let us breathe together as we build our waveform.”
She looked around at the people in the big tent, some sitting, some standing. She began the age old Buddhist breathing meditation, in, out, in, out. She felt the air pass over the hairs in her nose, cool, warm, cool, warm. Her mind reached out to the man sitting across from her, a giant of a man with a huge black beard, very Slavic looking. She could feel his breaths, deeper than hers, but also more labored. She reached out to the corner of the tent, where Nyssa sat with a large drum, gently striking it with her palm. Her breathing and Nyssa’s were similar and the drum began to follow them. She felt the big man adjust to the drum. She could feel him reach out to others in the room and them to others and after a few minutes, they were all breathing a little differently than on their own, and all together. Nyssa had stopped actually playing the drum, but they all sustained a drumbeat in their minds and could hear all 100 drumbeats synchronized.
“You are the conductor,” Nyssa thought to everyone, “and you are the instrument. We are the orchestra.”
Lina could feel people playing little games, seeing if they could breath twice as fast or half as much, adding little counterpoints to the waveform. Curiosity slaked, they relaxed back into the mainstream.
“We are now a living waveform,” Lina said. “When you think to the group, we will know not just your words, but much more of what you are feeling as you think these things. If you speak from sadness, we will know that. If you are confused or happy or angry, we will know that.”
“We have all spent these days in discussion and debate,” Raefe said. “We have come here in emergency mode, to try and do something to stop the awful forces that gather like floodwaters behind a weak dam.  Where we each live, we have been doing this for decades. So we also come knowing that we cannot stall history much longer. We are at the end of an era. What will the next era be like? The last 200 years have seen many ideas and failed attempts at finding a better way. Anarchists, socialists, communists, greens, libertarians, gener splicers, space colonizers — the list goes on. We also know the defenders of the status quo have their familiar fallbacks — facism, dictatorship, genocide, mindless materialism, and so on. None of that will stop the seas, wet the deserts or cool the poles. Let us now put the most powerful mind in human history to the task.”
******
Raefe looked out from the crowd at the other 99 delegates who had labored for two days on a final document to the meeting. He remembered seeing a picture of his father’s high-school graduating class, all the students lined up just like the delegates. No blue gowns, and very much international looking, but they had the same look on their faces. He could feel it — they sensed that their lives would now enter a new phase, that they were somehow freezing a moment in time that would only live as a memory. The moment when the world changed. Unlike his dad’s picture, these delegates hoped it would change for everyone, not just them.
They had decided to speak as one, and without introduction or fanfare, they spoke in one voice, their entanglement aiding precise synchronization of their words. No microphone was needed, as a powerful grand piano of humanity spoke.
“For 500 years, we have carried out a great social experiment that combined three core ideas: our economies should be based on private property, our governance on individual rights, and our knowledge on scientific learning. These three notions have not always been honored equally, but they have shaped society for centuries. We recognize other visions, too, in our history — social ownership of property has been a powerful idea that, while it failed to be fully realized, influences our thinking even now. The same could be said for high moral purpose — many of us live in the remains of failed religious states. But we acknowledge that these three core ideas, over hundreds of years, have brought us longer lives and a deeper understanding of nature. While they have promised progress toward social equality, the primacy of property has often thwarted that even to the extremes of human slavery.
But this period in our history is coming to a close. Private property has become corporate property, corporate property has become corporate power, corporate power has usurped individual rights. At the same time, individual rights may be exercised in ways that are not informed by scientific learning, and so we do many things, innocently, that are harmful to us and the world. Scientific learning has been extremely effective at helping us understand the physical universe, but less adept at helping us understand our own conflicts. How can we be rational and racist? Believe in equality and subjugate women? Science has been all too quiet on this front.
After 500 years, we have to say that these three pillars of our world no longer provide safe supports for human life. In fact, the clash between these three pillars is part and parcel of what we now face: that human beings will die off in huge numbers, or even become extinct, as most other species have in the last 100 years. We therefore conclude that:
The age of the nation is over. Transportation and communications have rendered the concept of living and dying in the same place obsolete. People, goods, and ideas must flow freely and safely across the globe. We must develop governance systems that enable this.
The age of private property is over. Climatic disruption has rendered the ownership of property irrelevant. How can we fight for property rights when the sea can seize our property in seconds? How can we fight for a land that can be turned into a desert as the rivers that water it dry up? What value is ownership that cannot stop these things from happening? We must develop economic systems that recognize that property rights only make sense when they support human rights, not just individual rights. The need to protect owners of capital so that they might innovate for the good of all is no longer pressing — the world is awash in capital but poor in the will to use it to address the real needs of the vast majority of humans. The goal of commerce must shift from making profit for owners to making life better for everyone.
The age of social rights must begin. Science has shown us that human beings have many differences among them, but none that make one human being entitled to claim a better life than others. We must develop economic and political systems that ensure every humans’ right to clean water, sufficient food and the same access to health care, education and other social benefits as any other person. Every person is socially equal to every other person on Earth, and no laws or customs should abridge that right. 
A new age of human science is needed. Today, we know that rationality and logic are powerful tools to understand nature. We also know that our minds don’t only think in that mode. We, along with other animals, have deep mechanisms of both empathy and antipathy, as well as other emotions, that strongly influence our behavior, often without us realizing that. We must develop the wisdom to understand ourselves so that we do not destroy ourselves.
Nor can our newfound knowledge of how to manipulate our own genes be used to create greater inequality among us. We do anticipate that artificial intelligence and perhaps even artificial life will become more powerful and possible, but we insist that society has a whole has the right and responsibility to decide how to use these new capabilities. They too, cannot become another reason for inequality.
For that reason, we reject the notion, increasingly powerful among our elites, that space travel is our only hope. Space travel is a hope that can only be fulfilled for a few thousand people in this century, maybe a few tens of thousands in the next. Someday, humanity will outgrow this home. But today, we must save it from ourselves.
A new age of human collaboration is needed. In the last decades, our ancient sense that we are somehow linked together has been confirmed. Now, hundreds of thousands of people around the world have become empaths, able to sense much more deeply each other’s thoughts and feelings. This capacity, latent in many if not all of us, has led to peace and collaboration among people who formerly engaged in great violence, even genocide, toward each other. We call on people everywhere to support deep exploration of our empathic abilities, from the underlying physics to the day to day practices that enhance their use.  Even if we cannot all master this ability, we can agree that in the balance between collaboration and competition, collaboration must be given priority if we are to survive.
We believe that all of these goals are reachable and that the next centuries will be marked by the struggle to reach them. There are likely many ways to achieve them. We urge all people working for change to measure their efforts at social change by how they advance toward this new world, and we offer our support to all those who contribute to that advance. Nature has given us the ability to evolve, and now it is up to us to do that.
Toward that end, we proclaim a new free association of people to be known as the Citizens of Everywhere, whose goal is nothing less than the global transformation of human society to a new level of collaboration, peace, justice, and well-being.”
Raefe’s first thought was that he wished Kiko and Kayam were here, and he began to cry, to mourn for the first time the world he had left, the world that had never had a chance to hear this. Sadness began to turn to joy as he heard the first claps, and then the cheers, and then all 10,000 of them chanting “Everywhere! Everywhere!”</Text>

            <Text>Same as it ever was
Greenbrier, W. VA
October 30, 2081
Ken Robertson hadn’t been to what used to be West Virginia since his college days, when he and some friends had white-water rafted down a river that had since dried up. Pretty country was the way he remembered it, although it made him think of old English stories about things hidden in the woods. Maybe that was why he had politely refused Warren’s suggestion that he take the scenic route down from D.C. through the mountains. Did he really want to chance becoming yet another kidnap victim being held for ransom by the White Power biker gangs that roamed the area?
So he found himself now in one of the stealth solar electric drones one of his companies operated, quietly approaching Warren’s compound on the old Greenbrier estate. The machine was state of the art: bioengineered substrate that extruded its own carbon fiber reinforcements, real-time conformational adjustments, solar superconductors powering hundreds of super efficient, high torque motors. Back in northern Virginia, an AI and his security team worked together with his MindsEye to fly him and watch for threats. They thought he was working on a top secret merger with one of Warren’s companies and that Warren had insisted on him coming alone. Well, that part was true. Anyway, he’d have to bring Lawrence, his security guy, into the picture at some point, but no rush yet.
“Put me down about 50 meters from the building with the blue awnings,” Robertson subvocced to the flight team. His implants registered their acknowledgment and he felt the drone start to circle down to a landing. He could see Warren standing by himself near the landing spot, waving. The AI took over and the drone landed silently and without so much as a bump. He stepped out and stretched, taking a deep breath.
“Sweet, ain’t it?” Warren said, grinning. “Good old country air.”
Robertson sniffed, trying to place what it reminded him of. “With just a touch of diesel — am I right? Haven’t smelled that for awhile. Didn’t know you could still buy it.”
“You are correct,” Warren answered. “Some of the boys are partial to diesel vehicles. Refuse to trade ‘em in on electrics. And they’re free to do that down here. I’ve got a pretty stash of the stuff. Keeps ‘em in the fold.”
Robertson had never understood Warren’s obsession with preserving old technology. Had Warren started early enough, he could easily have converted his vast stock of coal and oil assets to something more modern and friendly and not lost a cent. But Warren hadn’t and now he had affected a love of old energy as if they were Renaissance musical instruments or mechanical clocks.
“Your guys all out in the woods hunting or something?”
“Something. Sent most of them up toward Beckley. Labor troubles.”
“I’d have thought anyone with a job up there would be happy as a clam.”
“I’d have agreed with you. But we live in a selfish age. People want to be paid just for waking up in the morning. Want the state to pay them more just because the state can get if from me.That’s why I got West Virginia to sign a maintenance agreement with my company. We decide what’s a productive use of public monies now, not the politicians.”
“DigiBrands is doing the same thing in the Northeast. Every hurricane, every flood, more taxes. Has to stop. I can’t feed every homeless person.”
“That’s why the Liberty Plan is so crucial,” Warren said. “And I need your help with it. Let’s go for a walk.”
Warren led them across the lawn, past the huge old mansion that had served as a golf clubhouse for the rich back before golf had fallen victim to water taxes.
“Did you know that over 100 years ago, the rulers of this country built a secret bunker under in case of nuclear war?” Warren asked.
“Sure, everyone’s heard that story. Have you ever found it?” Robertson asked.
Warren gave him a big grin. “Oh yeah, we’ve found it. Would you like to see it?”
“Sure,” Robertson shrugged. Was this what the old boy had brought him down here for, to see some old 20th century Cold War relic?
They walked farther into the woods until they came to a clump of trees. Warren took out an old-fashioned metal key and bent down, brushing away leaves and dirt to reveal a round hatch with a lock. He put the key in the lock and turned it. Robertson heard a small click and then watched in fascination as Warren lifted the hatch.
“Works even if there’s an EMP weapon,” Warren said proudly, “unlike those fancy electronic locks you sold the government for $5,000 each.”
“If there’s been a big EMP burst, locks are the last thing we need to worry about,” Robertson said. “And those locks are impervious to being hacked by anyone who isn’t supposed to have access. DNA recognition plus some other pretty special technologies.”
“I like that idea. But my main point is that things have changed since Lausanne, don’t you think?” Warren answered. “Those Everywhere people have scooped up parts of the world that have more than chants and ‘net memes going for them. There could well be not only EMP weapons, but nuclear warfare in the next decades.  Hell, could be happening right now for all we know. Come this way.”
Warren guided him to the edge of the shaft. The hatch was just wider than a person, but inside was a shaft that was about 2 meters across. About a meter below the surface, there was a platform and they stepped on to it. A dim phosphorescent sort of light made it clear that the platform was a kind of elevator. Warren flipped a switch on the wall and they descended slowly. About 20 meters down, the platform stopped at the entrance to a side tunnel. Warren stepped off into it, waving at Robertson to do the same. After what seemed like less than a minute they entered a large chamber. Warren mumbled something into a control panel and the room was suddenly brighter. It was some kind of control center.
“I’ve got a secret that I’m going to share with you,” Warren said. “But this has to stay between us. I know people say that all the time, but I mean it. Just me and you — no aides, AIs, whatever. You good with that?”
“Sure,” Robertson said. People always had secrets in digital technology, what was the big deal?
“I have an engineer who’s an absolute genius. I rescued him from the Chinese government and now I’m his biggest fan. I’ve had him working on some of the stuff we talked about in Lausanne and I need you to tell me if you can make this stuff at scale.”
That was the story he and Hank had agreed on.
Robertson sensed a flood of images and data arriving in his implant. He let them stream through, letting his brain do the work of absorbing their meaning.
“You’re telling me the Chinese government has this technology?” Robertson asked, stunned by what he had seen.
“Oh no,” Warren said. “That’s all stuff he’s worked on for me. They have no clue.”
“People would be surprised to learn that you’re deep into biomolecular nanotechnology, I dare say,” Robertson said.
“I like to keep ‘em guessing,” Warren said, deadpan. He hadn’t considered that Robertson would see through his cover story, but he wasn’t going to give in. “Can you do it or not?”
“Well, there’s already a lot of manufacturing tech here, not just product designs. So yes, I think my people can.”
“Good, that’s good news. This is the key, Ken, you realize that? The key to us becoming more evolved, more powerful.”
“You’re full of surprises, Billy. I thought you were blowing smoke in Lausanne about some of this. I figured you had something up your sleeve. But this is Humanity 2.0, that’s for sure. We can’t lose with this.”
“Glad you see it that way. But I need something from you, in return.”
“What’s that?”
“I heard from my guys in Northern England that your team messed up. You missed the target. Were you going to tell me?”
“Sure. I just didn’t think it was that important. We’ll get him. He’s just a crackpot. White guy who went native and thinks he’s a cross between Jesus and Buddha. All that empathy stuff. He’d have more followers if he was a quack on a net channel.”
Warren smiled. “Yeah, I hear you. But I asked as a favor to one of my suppliers. He’s getting hurt by this guy and his people. I don’t need to go into the details, but let’s just say that even a quack can get a lot of ducks to follow him. And those ducks stopped listening to my friend. So he wants him gone.”
“I told you, we’ll get him. We’ve got feelers out all over Northern England.”
Warrren felt Hank in his ear. “Tell him to check Liverpool. We’ve gotten some whispers in that direction.”

            <Text>Let the chord ring out
Mari could hardly feel herself floating on the water. Her eyes could see only the peach-colored sky and other than that, her mind could absorb no more than the deep hum of thoughts from Adno’s people.
“Do you feel our wave?” Adno asked her.
“I feel as if I am sitting in a deep metal bowl and you have struck it. All around me, everything is vibrating.”
“Good, that is a good start. When you play your guitar, you make chords, no?”
“Yes, and I can almost feel a chord in the vibrations.”
“And a rhythm, too? Not a simple repeating pattern, but can you feel pulsing?”
“Yes! I can now, and it makes the chords clearer.”
They continued for hours, Adno’s school modulating and calling out to her, her riding the wave of their minds, losing it, finding it. She became aware that the sky was dark and she began to chill. Her enhancements could no longer compensate for the coolness of the water.
“Marilon, you are so close. One last try?”
She closed her eyes, letting the thoughts of the whole school rise up through the water and warm her like a million little fingers, caresses that resolved into melodies and chords, into slow and fast grooves that overlapped and diverted and rejoined. And then it became clear, what they were telling her.
“You are one of us, we are one with you, we are one together. You follow us, we follow Adno, Adno follows you, who follow us. We feel the currents you swim in, you swim in the currents we feel.”
She had joined the school. For the first time in her life, she was part of a waveform that included every sentient being on her planet, all at once. It was vast but not chaotic, united but not uniform. She recalled flying with her mother above one of Water Eye’s many islands. This one was covered with small plants with irridescent tips. As they flew around the island, the plants wave in the wind and reflected the sun in a beautifully changing and nuanced patterns. Times a million, that was what this felt like.
She would teach Anti, and they would teach Des and Nyssa.

Dadaab
February 3, 2082
Once Manfred had shown them the files, they set to work analyzing them. They were vast and difficult. Des created a way for Adno’s school to absorb them, and soon thousands of minds were at work, each linked  to the other in a way that made it easy to connect the dots. Des stayed with the school most of the time, fascinated to learn their techniques. Now he was taking a break.
“So you do this 24/7?” Nyssa asked him. “Are you aware of it?”
“Yes and no,” he said. “Sometimes, it’s a bit like having a day dream, or like when you drive a car and are thinking about something completely different while driving. It’s hard to describe. More and more, I’m not that aware of it until I find something interesting.”
“Remember Mrs. Odipo?”
“Our third grade teacher?”
“Yes! She was so boring, droning on forever. But of course, I had to listen because every once and awhile, she would say something that I knew would be on the test. So I would listen to her in the background and then perk up when I could sense from her that this was something she would put on the test.”
“Yes, that’s a bit of how it is,” Des said. “And this time, there is a really big test.” He shared what he had found with her.
“We have to tell everyone,” she said, quite alarmed. “This cannot happen.”
*****
“We now have the big picture,” Nyssa said to her family and their friends on Water Eye. “And I think you guys on Water Eye were right to suspect Hanikori. The magnitude and insanity of this plan is way beyond Warren or the other corpos, so we think Hanikori must be involved.
“Warren’s convinced most of the world’s leading oligarchs to construct an underground society of the elite. Being literally underground, they could wait out the continued chaos and destruction that would occur around the world as the climate continues to change and more and more people become homeless and loose any source of food.”
“How big a community?” Raefe asked.
“They had been talking 100 million, then 10 million,” Nyssa continued. “Now they talk about 1 million. The best sense we can make out of it is that they are having trouble recruiting.”
“And that takes us to the second aspect of this,” Des said. “We think they are promising people that if they join, they will live for a thousand years and have all sorts of powers.”
“He’s promising to give them the enhancements that we all have,” Flier said. “Genetic remodeling, nanobio maintenance, organic computing elements, the works. This is madness. In our long history, no Guardian has ever broken that barrier.”
“But there’s more, outside of the docs Manfred gave us.” Des said. “As you know, I’ve learned how to access networks with my mind. For weeks, I’ve been slowly meandering through the inner nets of UFS, which took me to DigiBrands, which took me to Warren’s own nets. And I’ve discovered something.”
“Wait, you were able to do all of that through your empathic ability?” Lina asked.
“I can’t explain it,” Des said. “It’s not about empathy, since we’re talking computers here. But I think it is about entanglement. And I think maybe because our nets are always so full of emotion — all the chats and entertainment and all of the stuff that’s not really factual that’s on the nets — that I somehow was able to cross that line. The truth is, organically, our abilities are based on quantum interactions, not human-level concerns.”
“You may be the first person in the Galaxy who can do this,” Raefe said.
“Unfortunately, that’s not true,” Des said. “Mari and Anti have told us that Hantikori is conducting secret research on transforming his species and others into a kind of living computer. And, I’m not convinced that Warren himself is not some kind of trained empath. He has had contact with Hantikori, after all.”
“True, we can’t rule that out,” Raefe said. “So tell us what you have found.”
“You should be receiving the full data,” Des said, “but the short of it is that Warren’s cabal is planning on sabotaging the nets world wide. Their goal is to accelerate chaos here on the surface.”
“Why?” asked Lina. “We seem to be doing that all on our own.”
“In part,” Des answered, “because he’s a bit of a sociopath. But their group is not doing so well attracting recruits to the new world order. So they want to shock them into joining through fear. They’ve created a super computer virus that will bring down electric power grids world-wide. They’re also selectively targetting banks outside their own, some governments, military nets and a bunch of other targets.”
“What do they think will happen?” Lina asked.
“They’ve done sophisticated modeling of the impacts,” Des said. “The short version: what’s left of the world economy will disappear. The only corpo-level businesses that will still function will be theirs. No governments or military large enough to matter will be able to respond. People around the world will be living in a world that no longer can buy and sell food, clothing or water from more than a few klicks away and only by bartering. More than 2 billion people will lose their jobs within a month. And the entire world will be in the dark, not knowing exactly what happened or why.”
“And here’s the worst part,” Nyssa said.
“Yes, I was getting to that,” Des said. “They will leak out small dibs and dabs that suggest that it was Everywhere that did this. They’re still deciding whether to go further and say it was empaths who did it.”
“I’ve been waiting for that,” Raefe said. “All these years, somehow we’ve been able to live without being a secret but without having a spotlight.”
“We’re not ready for this,” Lina said. “We’re still a year or two from Everywhere having the numbers and organization to take on something like this. Although, I’m not even sure I know how we would do that.”
“We think we know how,” Nyssa said. “Thanks to Adno.”
“Adno’s people are all entirely entangled with each other all the time, without the interface networks the Guardians us,” Des said. “Yes, they live as a school, so that makes sense. But that doesn’t mean other empaths can’t do that.”
“We felt something like that at the Congress,” Lina said. “And Edna’s people have been exploring that for years.”
“And now Anti and Mari have learned it from Adno’s people, and we have learned I from them,” Nyssa said. “And now we can teach it to thousands, millions on Earth.”

            <Text>Greetings
Earth
March 23, 2082
Raefe had woken before dawn. Somewhere, it was daylight and people were awake. He reached out and searched for their waveforms. He felt them swimming by in the thousands, small silvery lights in the dark. And then he he saw a brighter glow, another empath, one of trained band. He reached out to him and now they resonated. They moved together and found a third, a fourth, and their wave began to grow.
Within an hour, they had built a wave that circled the globe. Countless minds touching each other, feeling their common bond, understanding the task they faced. They were ready.
Des had hacked into the world’s vid and voice nets. Whatever Raefe chose to communicate as speech within the waveform, would also be broadcast on the world’s nets.
“People of the world,” Raefe said. “I speak to you today as a citizen of Everywhere. We have much to discuss, so I ask your patience. How you respond to what you are about to hear will determine the future of the human race. I have some shocking things to tell you, and some very hopeful news.”
“It’s no secret that the world’s largest corporations have increasingly taken over the running of the world. They use every crisis to force governments to give them more power. They use that power to benefit their owners, even when that harms the rest of us.
“What they have kept secret is that 13 of the world’s most powerful corpos have banded together and have a plan to take over the world. We have posted the documents that prove this on servers around the world and you can read them. What they say is that this secret cabal wants to build underground cities for themselves and perhaps a few million followers, take their money and resources and disappear underground, and then wait until the rest of us have destroyed ourselves fighting over the shrinking supply of food and water to come above ground and reclaim the Earth for themselves.”
He gave them some time to look up the docs and then continued explaining how this would take many generations. The documents discussed the long life treatments the super rich would give themselves, but he had decided not to dwell on that for now. There were more immediate threats to deal with.
“But as has been their habit, the super rich got greedy,” he continued. “They didn’t want to wait a hundred generations. So they planned a world-wide computer virus that would send us back to the world of more than 100 years ago, before we had computers and networks. Unprepared, we would be thrown into chaos. The fragility of our world, under constant climate disaster, our social fabric strained beyond breaking by billions of refugees, our governments no longer able to even pretend to serve us, this very fragility is what they cynically sought to leverage. But they will not succeed.”
“Just before our broadcast, citizens of Everywhere were able to penetrate this net attack and disassemble it. This cabal, led by Billy Warren, Ken Robertson and a dozen other corpos, has been thwarted.”
“Fellow humans, for the first time this century, we have averted a major disaster that could have led to our extinction. Both nature and the corpos will continue to threaten us. But we have learned more than just how to disarm massive computer attacks. We have learned how to connect.”
“Many of you know that I am an empath and for decades have been working to connect many other people with each other. When we can fully sense our fellow humans, we can create a level of trust between us that is fully capable of withstanding the stresses and strains the world puts upon us. We can work out our conflicts with full confidence that we are not being lied to or manipulated.”
“Recently, we have discovered that this ability can go far beyond the one to one interactions that I learned as a young man. As a species, we live as individuals, in small groups, in larger groups, and in the herds we call communities, tribes and nations. And it turns out, we can learn to think at those levels because we can connect into a single, complex wave, all of us, all at once.
“Right now, millions of people around the world are doing exactly that, reaching out to you. You will not lose your sense of self, your individual will, or any other such thing. You will be you, standing in a chorus of billions, humming joyfully as you see fully for the first time that your fellow humans really do want the same kind of things that you do, regardless of how different they might appear. That though we may occasionally threaten each other, we have gotten this far because, deep in our cells, we do know how to live together. No one is in charge, no one is giving orders. And you can leave the wave at will. You can sing your own notes too, if you want to alter the tune. This is not about conforming, it is about informing. So as you feel those first thoughts, reach back out to them and welcome them.”
He saw Lina across the room, her face beaming. She had let herself be swept off of that drowning beach so many years ago, not really knowing what was happening, just for this moment. He could feel the world vibrating between the many other Earths that existed on other timelines. And now he understood that the energy of that vibration was being organized and modulated by the waveform of his fellow humans, up to their chins in the mud of the swamp of greed and fear they had unintentionally built for themselves. Now, with full intention, they felt themselves ever so slowly rising up out of that swamp, into the brightness of day. A brightness that was now Everywhere.

            <Text>A rude awakening
Cambridge, MA,  on another Earth
November 7, 2048
It was Saturday and Raefe was, for once, not going to bother checking in with work. The Titan Towers sim could wait until tomorrow. His MiniWorlds pay had just been deposited,  he was full up on credits, young, healthy, and ready to have some fun. 
The wall Vid said no rain, high 62 — a typical early November day. He clicked his Voice on.
“Manny, Raefe. Are you around?”
A second later, Manny clicked in.
“What’s up Raefe?”
“Got a chip full of credits, a nice day, and no work. What’s up with you?”
“The same. Me and Raquel are going to the club tonight, but I’m free until then. You’re welcome to come later, too, if you want.”
“I’ll probably pass on that. I thought maybe things were going to get in motion with someone at work, but turns out she’s in more a girl phase right now. I’m checking the Club’s meetup wall  on my puter and I don’t see anyone that interests me. I don’t think I can bring myself to work the floor cold down there tonight. So, no thanks.”
“I hear you. We could get some sweats in. You want to meet up on the Harbor Trail?”
“Cool. Say 10?”
“Yeah, Castle Island at 10.”
He clicked the call off and got his stuff together for the bike ride down to Castle Island. Hopping on his bike, he avoided looking left at the MinWorlds building next store. He didn’t even want to see it today. Monday he’d go back to being a grunt. Today was his.
He tooled out from his apartment through the small condos and ethnic restaurants of TechTown and into ritzier North Point. He knew a little shortcut path that wasn’t on any maps that cut out the security checkpoints all around the edge of North Point — you never knew how long they would take. Pleased that he had once again avoided that inconvenience, he merged back onto the main trail that took him over the bridge into Boston. 
A few minutes later, he was pedaling at full speed, feeling the ocean breeze as it started to filter into the city. He loved this little stretch of trail. It was usually pretty empty and he could ride fast, the wind in his face. And then up a little hill and down and there was the whole harbor, out in front of him. 
He barely remembered the view before the trail had been built. In ‘31, the long-predicted rising seas had finally hit Boston, temporarily flooding everything along the waterfront. In typical fashion, the city had none nothing about it, despite a number of lesser repeats. But in the aftermath of the economic crash six years later, some smart person had made sure that all property on the waterfront — now an economic disaster of its own — was bought up, leveled and turned into a sort of levee to protect against future storms. 
The crest of the levee was a flat, winding strip about 50 meters wide, with a bike trail running down the center. The weekend crowds hadn’t come out yet and the trail was almost empty. The sun was bright enough that he avoided looking off to his left, but he came up and over a ridge that turned him toward the harbor and the sun exploded into his view. He winced, wondering why his sunglasses weren’t doing a better job as the sun grew brighter. It hurt now, his head throbbed, he gasped, blinded now. Without thinking, he let the wheel hit the grass that bordered the trail and fell over, but the bright light somehow still pierced his eyes, like a laser trying to drill through the back of his skull. The light became more discrete, like marbles inside his head. They pulsed in a complex rhythm that never seemed to repeat. He could barely notice or think of anything else.
After a few minutes, the process began to reverse itself, becoming less intense. Lying on his side, not sure where he was or what the hell was going on, he was frightened. Where was the water? Was it going to wash him away? What was he thinking? He was on a ridge looking down to the water, many meters above it and half a kilometer from the shore. But he was filled with dread that the water was going to wash him away.
It’s going to be OK, calm down, he thought. You’ve just fallen on your bike. You must have gotten some dust in your eye or something.
Where did that huge wave go? some part of him asked and he realized that he could hear another set of thoughts that seemed to be from another part of his mind. Something was wrong with his brain, he thought, he had to get help. He must be having a stroke or some kind of attack caused by a tumor.
No, it’s OK, the other voice said. There’s nothing wrong, just give it a minute.
And he sat dumbfounded as some part of him he had never known slowly explained that some other version of himself had come from other version of reality and was now rattling around inside his head, trying to tell him it was going to be OK. Was he going insane? It didn’t feel like that. This other self was very familiar, comfortable almost, like a very old friend that he had somehow lost touch with but was now instantly familiar. Without thinking much about it, he could feel a rapid fire exchange of images and words going on. It was enticing, as if he was looking into a mirror and saw himself, only he was slightly different, and the guy in the mirror was explaining how different and there was nothing really odd about that, was there? After all, there were an infinite number of universes, he had read that somewhere, hadn’t he, and this guy was from one of them, and it was a very similar universe, but he had to leave it because he was going to die in a huge tidal wave because of climate change and some aliens had helped him and now he was going to be here in his head but they would merge soon and it would all feel perfectly natural. If only he could just remember how to move his limbs and get up off of the ground and back on his bike.
Oh, sorry, the voice said. You should be OK now.
And he felt his body again. The sun was just the sun again, even if it looked funny and sideways. Oh, I’m lying on my side, he thought, wondering how long he had been there.
“Are you OK?”
He looked around and saw a young woman straddling her bike.
“I saw you riding in front of me and then all of a sudden you went down like a bag of groceries, like you had been shot,” she said. She had a wrist Voice and her hand was poised to activate it. 
Suddenly, he felt her anxiety and an image popped into his mind of a black-haired young man lying on the ground, his techie bike clothes odd for someone with his disheveled hair and barcode tatto on his neck. He looked slightly wild-eyed, something pained in his expression. Raefe realized he was seeing himself as she did. How did that happen? 
“Oh, thanks for stopping,” he said, trying to keep the panic out of his voice. “I’m OK. I was just daydreaming, I guess, and I must have caught the edge of the grass with my front wheel and just gone down. No damage, as far as I can tell, other than my pride.”
“OK, just wanted to make sure you weren’t hurt,” she said and then was gone, pedaling off fiercely.
He tapped his ear and asked his Voice what time it was, confirming that it had all happened in an instant. I think it would be best if we just continued with the day, his other self said, and just let things take their course.
“Sure,’ he said, realizing that he had spoken out loud. “Sure, if you say so. Have you done this before?”
“No, this is new territory for me, too,” the voice said. “But Mars Girl gave me a sense of what it would be like and so far, this is pretty normal. If you can call transferring your consciousness to another version of yourself in another timeline normal. Mars Girl — Diver is actually her real name — has much more experience with this than me, so I took some comfort from her advice.”
“Who’s Diver?” he replied, wondering about the Mars Girl part.
“Oy, we’ve got a lot of catching up to do,” his other self said to him.</Text>

November 8, 2048
Diver had to contact Raefe soon. She knew what his first question would be, and so she searched for Far Flier in the waveform. What had he done about Lina?
Just as she sensed Far Flier, he walked into her quarters.
“I know you want to contact Raefe right now,” he said. “There’s a lot I need to explain to you, but it will have to wait. Just for now, tell him that Lina is alive. She’s in Kenya, which was part of Efricar in her original timeline. But in this timeline, they have not met.”
“But she will carry recent memories, no?” Diver asked, “Just as he does?”
“Yes, she will understand the last year or so of her old life, similar to him.”
“He’ll be relieved. When can we talk further?”
“Just find me when you’re ready. We have much to do.”
She had a lot more to ask him, but she put all of her questions aside and let her mind drift into the wormhole interface network, which now connected to Earth in the new timeline. She had not entangled with Raefe in this timeline yet — the first time in a new timeline was always a bit tricky. She thought of his thought pattern in the same way she would remember a face in a crowd. As the complex waveform coming from Earth in the new timeline washed over her, she looked for his signature. There!
“Mars Girl! It’s about time!” Raefe said, sounding not a little bit peeved. “Me and my new self have been waiting for hours for you to explain what the heck we do now.”
“Perhaps we should use my real name, eh? Raefe from this timeline, I’m Diver From Great Heights, or Diver to most people. I am an ambassador from the Guardians, an ancient organization of 20 worlds in this galaxy that have intelligent life. We work to foster and protect emerging intelligent species, such as your own, throughout the galaxy,” she said. “I’m sorry that you’ve been awake for hours. Things don’t always line up exactly from one version of a world to another. I’d hoped to contact you while you were asleep, since you always enjoy hearing from Mars Girl in your dreams.”
“What did you do?” Raefe asked. “I’m asking for both of us.”
“The Guardians have a much more advanced knowledge of physics, as we’ve discussed before,” she said. She’d heard other Guardians talk about how awkward these “we know more than you” conversations with less advanced species could feel, and now she knew what they meant. “But some scientists in your world have already started exploring the idea of the multiverse. Without going into great depth, the quantum nature of reality means that there really are an infinite set of possible universes at any given moment. Some of the possible ones are also actual — they exist in different quantum spaces. We can’t physically travel between our own universe and others, but we can send energy between them, just as we send energy through the wormhole to have these talks. To save you from the tidal wave on Truro Island, we’ve sent the energy that is the waveform of your consciousness to this version of Earth, to this Raefe that has always lived on this version of Earth, that you and I are both experiencing for the first time.”
“You’ve given me a second chance, a replay?” he asked. She could feel a mixture of incredulity, relief and confusion emanating from him.
“Exactly!”
“So what do I do now?”
“That’s up to you, Raefe from this timeline. You are still you. You’ll find that Raefe from the other timeline only remembers things in the last year or so of his life, and mostly the more recent things. Of course, most of your personality is older than that, so it won’t take long before the strangeness fades and you’ll just accept that you’ve visited some places, know some people, and had some experiences that don’t exist for you in this world. Think of it like visiting a place when you were younger that made an impression on you, but no longer exists. But Raefe from the other timeline has strong feelings about certain things and those feelings may well persevere and become a part of you, too.”
“And if I tell anyone about this, they’ll have me sent to a mental hospital, right?”
“That is a likely outcome, yes. Your society is centuries away from accepting this as possible, let alone normal. So it’ll be our little secret.”
“Shit! Speaking of crazy stuff, who is Lina?” Raefe asked. “My new other self seems very intense about her.”
“Yes, Raefe and Lina were a dyad in the other timeline, although they had not yet reproduced together. In this timeline, unfortunately, you have never met. She is still in Africa, where her Chinese father went to work and met her African — Kenyan to be precise — mother, and where she was born. But she is alive and well and remembers you and remembers that you were lovers.”
“Well, nice to know I get a girlfriend in the bargain,” Raefe said. “So what am I supposed to do? Post online: ‘Nice Jewish boy interested in Afro-Chinese woman from a different timeline looking for empathic mate?”
“It’s a bit more complicated than that. Over the next few days, I will visit you and tell you what you need to know.”
“This is so weird. Can you explain this to me again? I mean I already heard my new inner self’s explanation, but I’m not sure he got it right.”
“All of the Guardian species can send their thoughts instantly across space through wormholes, and that they can receive other people’s thoughts the same way. That’s what we’re doing now, actually. But we can do something else, too: we can send a person’s consciousness across not only space, but time.”
“So where I was before it wasn’t 2048?”
“No, we can’t send thoughts to the past or future. But we can send them to many different presents. I realize your species hasn’t discovered this yet, although some of your scientists have examined the idea.”
“Yes, and some of our habitual drug users, as well. You’re kidding me, though — that’s really true?”
“Yes. We exist in many universes, each different in many ways, subtle or obvious. Just as there are universes where you don’t exist. Because random events that led to your existence never happened, or because random events led to your destruction. In this case, a tidal wave on Earth in one timeline caused your death there. The Raefe from that timeline, you have a deep memory of a beach on the island where you stood with Lina, holding her hands, where you told her you loved her? There is that beach in this world. In this universe, it’s not on an island because it is still part of Cape Cod. That tidal wave never happened because the Greenland Ice Sheet still exists. And the Surtsey volcano hasn’t erupted, because of many other events that are different in the two universes.”
“You’re telling me that there are other Earths where things are actually more messed up than here?”
“Yes, and you will have to consider what that means to you. Right now, you have been living your life without too much thought of where your world is headed. Now you know that there are versions of your world that are only slightly different but in much worse shape. That’s another way of saying that pretty soon, your world could be in much worse shape.”
“And you think telling me this will somehow enable me to save the world?”
“No, I think by giving you a second chance you and others may somehow save the world. Stress and crisis often accelerate the emergence of new capabilities in living things. There are more people like you now, although none with as strong an empathic ability yet. You, Lina, people as yet unknown — you will be the key to a second chance to turn your abilities from a cause of headaches and sleeplessness into a force to change your world in this one. A second chance to build a life that you will be proud of.”

“How did he take it?” Far Flier asked, sinking into the chair her room made for him when he visited. 
“He’s angry. We’ve disrupted his life, and he doesn’t see why. His abilities have only ever been disabilities to him. I’m counting on his memories of the flood and the refugee camp to spark a sense that he’s dodged a bullet. I talked to him about second chances. I hope he can grasp that, but I leaned into it a bit hard. I wasn’t ambigous about his world’s chances.”
“You may have skirted the line there, but if you had to err, I agree with doing it on that side of the line. I hope he responds. I think you said the right things, though.”
“But I need to understand what the hell is going on here. There are too many secrets between us. How did you transport him to a new timeline without Green’s group? And what did you do with Lina?”
“I would have explained had there been time.”
“Well, there’s time now,” Diver said, the small feathers in the middle of her head just starting to harden, though not yet the full crest her species displayed when threatened.
“I’ve suspected for some time that Green has had his own agenda. Given the importance of the Earth project, I had made contingency plans. Let’s just say that in 800 years of being a Guardian, I have acquired a passing knowledge of everything we do. And friends throughout the different departments. I will tell the Council that I exercised my authority as head to carry out an emergency transport of Raefe.”
“And Lina?”
“They cannot know about Lina.”
“Why? What have you done?”
“I told you that I implanted the knowledge of Raefe and their relationship in her mind so that she would know him when they made contact. How did you think I did that?”
She stared at the garish gold cuffs of his tunic. Why were they so large and bright? Flies Far somehow always managed to be out of fashion, even when he was trying to be fashionable. She realized she was trying to distract herself from the growing realization of what he had done. She could not believe it. She would make him say it.
“How?”
“Like most intelligent life, she had latent abilities to entangle. I brought them to the surface.”
“You used your abilities to change her brain?” Go ahead, say it. Say that you carried out the most forbidden and dangerous of all Guardian interventions in emerging species.
“Actually, I combined with Raefe to do it. That’s why I asked you to have Raefe be with her when his mind was transported. When humans feel deeply about each other, as Raefe and Lina do, they are all but entangled. I could feel the pathways her mind uses to connect to other people. And I, in essence, trained her to feel them by showing her precisely where Raefe’s emotive thoughts were in her mind. Time will tell how well she takes to it, but she is now a rudimentary empath and an entangler as well.”
“But you know it was wrong. It’s always been a guiding principle of the Guardians — we guide, we don’t direct. We use what evolution has given our contacts, not what we can reprocess them to be.”
“I know it is illegal. And risky.”
“Yes, and you have put her at risk, not to mention the entire Earth project — and the nine billion people on the planet — at risk. And what about me? First you lobby for me to guide Earth — why I don’t know — and then you make it unlikely that I will be allowed to continue. I’m wondering if your mind is working properly.”
 “I wanted you in charge of the Earth project because I know you’re honest and you are a true Guardian.”
“What do you mean, a true Guardian? There were dozens of other Guardians who could have taken this on. It’s only a small project — a few thousand promising latents to monitor and a handful of active entanglers, with only one sufficiently far along to actually contact.”
“I have shielded you from too much,” Far Flier said. “I see that now. As head of the Guardian Council, I cannot share all with you. But as two people trying to do the right thing, we have to share more of what we know. And that is on me.”
She nodded, waiting for him to drop the wall of reticence she sensed in him.
“Not every Guardian believes in our mission,” he continued.
“You can’t really believe—”
 “Let me finish,” he said. “You weren’t on the Council when certain things happened. For example, when the first Earth project failed. Or when the 100 year assessment was made of new candidate species.”
“No, I wasn’t even a Guardian when the last assessment was done. And I was just an ambassador in training when the Earth project first began.”
“Think of how we Guardians work. We have five main pillars: Discovery, Information Analytics, Ambassadors, Administration and Timelines. Discovery finds inhabited worlds that show signs of intelligent life — gases in the atmosphere that don’t occur naturally, broadcasts, that sort of thing. Information Analytics then monitors those worlds, building up a fuller picture and creating  a profile of what stage of development these life forms are at. They are in charge of the 100 Year Assessments, which set our agenda. At the last one, which was 80 years ago, they presented only one candidate to the Council for an Ambassador.”
“Just Earth? I guess I had never made that connection. Were there really no others?”
“There were four or five others. But several in the Council talked them down. ‘Not promising,’ ‘light years from advancement,’ and so on. And they were barely willing to continue with some of the species we had begun with from the prior assessment.”
“Okay, so Earth is the only game in town. How does that justify rigging the game?”
“This is not about Earth. Don’t you see? The very existence of the Guardian mission is being called into question. If Earth is our only project, and Earth fails, what purpose do we serve? Ask your colleagues in Information Analytics — do they think there are more worlds to guide? Not likely.”
“Well, what if it’s true? What if we have fulfilled our mission and identified all the civilizations that both needed our help to advance and warranted our involvement to prevent them from becoming a threat? At least for now, and in this region of the galaxy?”
“I think it would be more accurate to say that we aren’t looking very hard, and we aren’t very eager to try any more. We have done nothing to expand our search area or to refine our assessments in centuries. I’ve come to believe that a growing number of Guardians, particularly on the Council, have lost sight of our purpose.  I’m going to call this issue at the next Council — I hope to reignite the fires. But I implore you not to bring up Lina. With Raefe, I will take responsibility for bypassing the usual procedures. But if we acknowledge Lina’s transformation, that will become the only issue on the table and the consequences will be dire. I know I’ve lost your trust, but I hope you will come to see that I made a hard choice to preserve our work with Raefe, and with the humans, because otherwise, the odds of their survival are quite low.”
“I am deeply torn over this, Far Flier. I find myself uncomfortable with both the affection I had for you and the distrust I’m feeling now. You will know tomorrow what my decision is about Lina. But it may take me longer to come to decide what our future holds.”
After he left, her anger faded to sadness. Saving Raefe and Lina should have been a moment of joy, a continuation in their adventure together of the mind, body and spirit, a step toward a bright future. Far Flier had spoiled that with his disdain for their code. Or was she naive to think that the code deserved more respect? She was disappointed to even be contemplating this.
Many Guardians had trouble understanding what life was like for species who had only what evolution had given them, whose lives lasted only a century or so. Such a life seemed so incomplete, fleeting, fraught with loss and unrealized dreams. Just now, she felt closer to a life of transient joy and unpredictable loss than she ever had before.

            <Text>Get her goat
December 14, 2048
It was just after dawn when Lina slipped quietly out of their condo in the Shanzu district onto Serena Road. She wanted to get to the market while the stalls selling African foods were still open. It was Sauda’s birthday and she would make her a meal of Kenyan foods. Yang Zhao had banished most local dishes from the dinner table, so her mother’s treat would have to be a lunch of ugali and nyama choma while Zhao was at the office.
Serena Road was only half full at this hour, three wheeled delivery vehicles and lurching electric buses the main traffic. Most of the Shanzu inhabitants were like Zhao, Chinese middle managers  who took the bus a few kilometers down the 88 to the port in Mombasa. Zhao worked there in the main planning office for Chinese civil engineering projects on the Kenyan coast. Others took the light rail up to the big cement manufacturing complex in Bamburi. In ninety minutes, the market and all the shops would become Chinese, filled with local fish and chicken, imported pork and vegetables, and whatever else was imported to make Africa seem like an extension of the Middle Kingdom.
She remembered a quiet morning almost a year ago, she and Raefe up early to catch a train to Vermont. They talked excitedly about hiking in the mountains as they strolled through Union Square to the subway. Truck drivers, hospital nurses, all sots of working people starting their day off in the early dawn light bustled about quietly while the city still slept. In a few more days, they would have their regular Vid call. Today, part of her missed him. And the other part felt a weird anticipation about meeting him. But she turned her thoughts away from that — it might be many months before they were able to save up for a visit. In the meantime, she was slowly preparing her parents, feeding them little tidbits about the boy she had met in an online computer science club.
For now, this was still her life — a student living with her parents, trapped in the limbo of their social isolation from their own communities. Anyway, next week she would be shipped up the coast to Kiunga. Her father had succumbed to pressure from his bosses at the Coastal Friendship Alliance to “volunteer” his daughter to work on the harbor construction project up there. She was ambivalent about going, but at least it would be change. Maybe it was better to be on her own for awhile — she could think more clearly and sort out what she felt about her new found empathic abilities, this Raefe that she knew but didn’t know, and just what she wanted to do with her life.
Lina ambled through the dusty market streets wedged in between the 88 and Old Shimo La Tewa Road. She found the ancient woman everyone knew only as Auntie.
“Milima, how unusual to see you at this hour. Is your house on fire?”
“No, Auntie,” she smiled, playing through their usual routine. “Only my mother’s stomach. Her Chinese daughter sleeps, but her Kenyan daughter comes for your medicine. Do you have corn meal today?”
“So half the mountain comes to me. You are in luck. I have a fresh batch of meal, just the medicine for your mother. She is lucky to have such a good daughter, to fetch it for her.”
“And even luckier that I am going to make ugali for her today.”
Auntie’s face betrayed her skepticism. “When did you learn how to make ugali?”
Like most of the locals, Auntie was keenly aware of the local Chinese disdain for Kenyan food and customs. But Lina was annoyed. Surely Auntie knew that she had practically been raised on the local corn porridge.
“Sometimes, when my father is away, Sauda cannot help herself,” Lina said, laughing. “She makes us Kenyan food. When I was a girl I’d complain and she’d just say ‘I’ll forget how otherwise.’ And she’d show me how, too.”
“Well, don’t forget, the secret to good ugali is to wait until the water is hot, and stir in the meal with a straw whisk. I’ll give you one if you don’t have one.”
“Thanks, Auntie, that would be great. Mom will be grateful.”
She wandered through the market, feeling the energy of the shoppers, fresh from sleep, not yet worn down by a long  day working in the heat. And something else — a comfort, an ease that came from the familiar. It was the same feeling she got from her father when he was among his countrymen. The feeling that so easily could turn to discomfort and unease with each other when Kenyans and Chinese came together. She wondered how to change that. Could it be changed?
Her musings were interrupted by the site of Musa, the halaal butcher.
“What brings you out so early, Milima?”
“I wanted to be sure you still had goat.”
“You are going to surprise your father?”
“Not unless you have Chinese moon cakes. No this is for my mother. I’m going to roast her some nyama choma.”
“Oh, she will love that. Make sure you get the right wood for the barbeque grill,” Musa said, and proceeded to give her a long series of tips on how to make the best roast goat.
As she walked back up Serena Road toward the ocean, she could sense people behind the doors awake now. Behind her, the native district smelled of mandazi doughnuts and chapati bread, heavily milked chai and coffee. In front of her, the Chinese quarter was full of congee, steamed buns and tea. She could feel the contentment that everyone in all directions had as they ate their first meal. So many ways to the same happiness, so easy to mistake the food for the satisfaction it brought.
She had a brief flashback of espresso  and Mexican donuts with Raefe. It made her happy, but she had to laugh imagining them sitting in a tea shop in Shanzu. People would be thinking, “My, she’s Chinese and African. He’s white. Seems like they’ve got the whole world covered.” And then some! If they had a kid, they could get it a T-shirt: “I’m one quarter Jewish, too.”
Well, they’d burn that bridge when they came to it. If only.

            <Text>Secret experiments
Traveller’s Perch
January 20, 2049
Hanikori had picked the location with great care. On the slopes of the only active volcano on Traveller’s Perch, there was an ancient lava tube. Deep at the bottom, boiling lava sent hot air out of a vent at the top. Nearly invisible until you were right in front of it, there was a small chute that lead to the vent, just large enough to enter. The shape of the tube prevented too much heat from entering it. But the entire area was filled with masses of swirling ions generated by the lava below. There was so much quantum activity that most Guardians could never penetrate the static to entangle with him, let alone an ordinary citizen. 
Hanikori, on the other hand, had made a study of quantum noise and perfected his own filtering techniques. So the cave was safe from prying minds. Still, he trusted no one.
“Green, please activate the e12 interface and distribute a quantum key for this meeting. No one must know what we are discussing.”
All 17 of them absorbed the four-dimensional construct that would allow them to converse in isolation, their waveform impossible to comingle with any others without their knowledge.
“This meeting couldn’t come at a more crucial time,” Hanikori said. “The most naïve of the Guardian ambassadors, Diver, has gone beyond her usual silly projects — recently she had cadets catch fish in their teeth — and is now revealing herself to the barbarians of Earth. These are nothing more than primitive killers, and yet she has blinded herself to their natures.”
“What of it, Hanikori?” Putnomo, a large quadruped from one of the farthest Guardian worlds, interrupted. “Let her waste her time while they destroy themselves.”
“You are many light years from them,” Hanikori answered. “We are only 20. She may already be breaking her oath and leaking technical information to them. I believe her objectivity may be compromised.  If she persists, in a millennia or two, they may well develop the means to threaten not only us, but other nearby Guardian species.”
“Hanikori, you are a politician and you excel at the age-old craft of frightening the populace. I am a scientist,” Putnomo said. “Earth  could not become a threat to us in ten millennia, even if they survive.”
“Are you willing to bet the future of all life on that, Putnomo?” Green interrupted with disgust. “Perhaps you won’t feel so complacent when you learn that Far Flier suggests you must make do with less energy for your lightspeed engine development. When he tells you the energy is needed to continue shifting humans to timelines where they haven’t yet blown themselves up, you will surely reconsider.”
 “Enough,” Hanikori thundered, the waveform vibrating with his intensity. “Let us remember our purpose today.”
“Thank you,” Putnomo said. “Whatever our differing opinions about Diver and Earth, we can all agree that the most important thing is to press ahead with our work on e12.”
Only this group knew about e12,  the latest iteration in the top-secret research they had been carrying out for more than a thousand years. 
 “I have excellent news to report,” Putnomo said. “About 600 years ago, we Guarded a very unusual species on the outer edges of the Eta Carinae nebula. It is the only life, let alone intelligent life, that we have ever found that was composed solely organized gas and plasma. We learned very little about it before Eta Carinae erupted in a partial nova that destroyed the region. For those of you who are new to our efforts, it was this encounter that started Hanikori and myself and a few others to realize that with some effort, this kind of life could be immortal.
 “Three things had to be solved to make that happen. The first – reducing an individual’s consciousness to free-standing waves ––– is already something all of our species could do, if we had not bound ourselves foolishly to retain our ancient forms. The second was how to overcome entropy – how can a waveform, in essence, eat while still retaining its essential nature? The third was how to continue to manipulate matter while remaining pure energy.”
Hanikori could hardly contain his impatience. Putnomo was always so impressed with himself. “Yes, yes, but what have you learned recently?”
Putnomo let them see his laboratory, hidden in a cloud of comets in a remote and dense protoplantetary star system. Inside was a force field in which only a large plasma cloud existed, suspended within intense magnetic fields. They watched as Putnomo donned a helmet on his homeworld, nearly a billion kilometers away. For a few seconds nothing happened and then Putnomo allowed them to entangle with the plasma cloud itself, through him. And then he broke his connection with them.
The waveform shuddered as they all gasped. The plasma cloud retained much of Putnomo’s consciousness. In fact, it shifted gradually as they entangled with it.
Putnomo reconnected with them. “Yes, I was able to project my consciousness into the cloud, and while it couldn’t think entirely new thoughts, it did react to you in small ways. For the first time, we have created consciousness in a cloud of plasma.”
The waveform pulsed with approval and delight. Even Hanikori was impressed.
“Are there fundamental issues you still need to address?” he wondered.
“Not fundamental ones, no. We have some decades of engineering before we can attempt a full transfer, and then perhaps some more time to ensure stability. But there is every reason to believe that we have found a way to preserve consciousness for all time. In short, to be immortal.”
“And what about the third obstacle,”  Green asked. “Does any of this bode well for allowing conscious plasma to still interact with the physical universe at ordinary temperatures?”
“We have been working in parallel on that. We chose the confined plasma precisely because we have known for millennia how to control it. It was one of the main technologies of the controlled fusion era. Reversing that, having the plasma control ordinary matter, is challenging but conceptually well understood. Many of the principles involved in lightspeed engine research can be reversed to apply to this.” Putnomo was in all his glory now. “I feel strongly that we are perhaps 100 years away from a demonstration combining conscious energy capable of controlling material objects.”
Hanikori steered them back to the immediate threat. “All the more reason to not waste time or resources on foolishness. The lightspeed engine project is our cover story, and we need to keep the project alive, even if it’s mostly fake.”
“What is your proposal?” asked Putnomo.
Hanikori hesitated. He wasn’t interested in fully revealing his plans. “We must lay the groundwork for us to turn the Guardians from the  fostering of any kind of conscious life to the further development of all of our species, who are the highest form of consciousness.”
“What is at stake,” he continued, “is nothing less than the evolution of conscious life itself. In a million millennia, only 20 species have in the entire galaxy have reached the stage of enhanced life. Should we spend another billion years hoping to find a few more? And leave ourselves vulnerable to forces beyond our control? To the whims of supernovas and their gamma ray beacons? To attack from far corners of the galaxy, or from beings in other galaxies who have gone beyond us in lightspeed travel or solved the riddle of faster than light travel?”
“We have earned immortality, and we deserve it,” he said forcefully. “Let us turn the Guardians from this foolish philosophy of naïve benevolence to one of true Guardianship – of our species, and our future.”
The meeting was over, and Hanikori felt minds drop away. But Green lingered.
“Are you not concerned about this development with this Raefe?” he asked. Hanikori was being unusually eliptical about it.
“I am quite concerned,” Hanikori said. “But I have a plan.”
“Care to share it?” Green asked. “We’ve been in this together for a long time.”
“And we will share a victory toast. Soon. For now, the most good you can do is to keep an eye on Diver. She is such a foolish being. She will be an important unwitting ally.”

            <Text>TechTown
January 22, 2049
The train glided to a stop in TechTown, with it’s 40-story glass towers towering over  Cambridge. Several heads jerked upright, their Voices telling them through their fashionably discrete ear implants that it was time to wake the frick up and get off the grimey train and head to their jobs. Shiny little office nerds, nervously tapping their eyeglass puters on. Must check those messages, wouldn’t want to have to look at all the grimey losers on the train.
Raefe couldn’t afford such fancy gear. Plain old flesh-colored skingel minibuds would have to do on his codetech salary. Right now, he was near the bottom of the food chain: a CodeEngine jockey who operated the software that MiniWorlds used to churn out application code. If he proved himself, he could move up to design and build the software that ran the CodeEngine clusters. Then from there, he could become a softsystems architect, helping design the complex EvoEco virtual ecosystem that evolved all the codes to work together to get anything done. Then he could think about invisible implants, or actually moving to the top floors of those 40-story towers, with their views of the harbor to the East, and the low hills landward. Right now, he was happy enough to look out of his own apartment at the building next door.
Or I could stop chasing this foolishness because I know it will all be under water someday if the world doesn’t smarten up. Someday in my life, not some far distant future in a scifi vid.
And find Lina. Their online exchanges left him aching for her. Not just for the pleasure of her sex. Somedays not even mostly for that. But for the pleasure of their comfort together. For the deep letting go that his body remembered more than his mind and had now become fully integrated into his consciousness. He was in love with a girl he had never met. Now even the sight of her words on the screen triggered memories from another time and place, and made him long for more.
That would have to wait. He had reached his workstation. There was already a good number of work orders waiting for for him. The usual crap: build a socket for input A to plug into module B, turn a fixed input into a user-adjustable one, and so on. CodeEngine had already downloaded all the parts he would need, but he needed to do some research to find out the full context the code would be used in before deciding exactly which variants of the parts, and in which order, he should use. 
The morning went by on autopilot. He worked through his usual espresso break and dispatched his to-do list and sent the results off for testing. The part of him that had survived the tidal wave did better in the mornings. As the day wore on, he grew restless with the routine, so he had taken to front-loading his day with work and rewarding himself with an actual lunch break. No more sipping smoothies at his desk while working. MinWorlds didn’t care, as long as they could keep feeding their sim frameworks to their customers, who turned them into finished sims, games, courses or whatever.
After lunch, he would have the results and could make corrections and do final tuning and optimizing. He looked across the wide expanse of the office where all the CodeEngine jocks sat. Nikko was heads down, the furrowed brow she got when she was deep inside the machine. Herbie was leaning back, arms folded, contemplating the screen — the thoughtful face he used when thinking about non-work items. Roderick was doing that thing with his hands where he would held them high above the keyboard, and hit a key at a time with a motion like he was conducting an orchestra. He always did that when he sent his code off to the test queue. So, at least two for lunch. He sent them a word bubble to meet at 12:10 on the water walk.
Raefe wandered out there, soaking up the early spring rays. He was looking for the Ethiopian food truck — close as he could get to Lina. He got a plate of chicken wat and some bread and walked over to the part of the water walk that jutted further out over the harbor. He grabbed a table big enough for three and waited for Herbie and Rod.
What were they thinking when they built this, he wondered. In 10 or 20 years, this could be underwater. Why didn’t they spend the money to build a solar farm or rebuild the grid or anything that would forestall the rising seas? Instead of a nice lunch place for software builders.
“Hey, you look deep in thought,” Herbie said. “What’s up?””
“Oh, nothing,” he said. “Just thinking how life is short on time and long on bullshit.”
“OK, then,” Herbie said. “Is that from your upcoming book, ‘Raefe Speaks?’ You have been very philosophical lately.”
“I guess so,” Raefe said. “No one told me that building grunt code would not only make me unrich, but deeply wise. They really should include that in the job posting.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Herbie said. “Seems like so many jobs offer a life of enlightened poverty.”
“What?” Rod said, just sitting down. “Poverty? What do you know about that? You should come with me next time I visit my family in Nigeria.”
“It’s all relative,” Herbie said. “What you’’re used to.”
“Right,” Raefe said. “Herbie, you’re used to whining. Rod,you’re used to reminding us all that you grew up where oil sludge goes to die.”
“And you,” Rod said. “What are you used to?”
“Eating lunch with you two, so that I can soak up the full range of human experience.”
Talk turned to work — which supervisor was the biggest jerk, which single women were at least semi-hetero, which of them might be desperate enough to consider a fellow CodeEngine jock as a sex partner, and so on. Raefe started to tune out during the sex talk — he had lost interest in pursuing the usual suspects in favor of figuring out how to reunite with Lina. Something Rod said kicked off a series of recollections from other Raefe.
“Hey, not to break up this highly enlightening discussion of relationship building techniques, but I’ve been meaning to ask you Rod, where again are you from in Nigeria?”
“Ikorodu. It’s near Lagos.”
“Right. And why would I have heard of it before I met you?” Raefe asked. Something from his other self had been tickling the back of his mind about Nigeria, but he couldn’t quite reach it to scratch.
“You probably heard about the whole mess there with development. The government had this grand plan to create a floating city on Lake Lagos that was connected to Ikorodu. With Lagos having over 30 million people, the government wanted to build housing to relieve that congestion and Lagos is not far away.”
“But they messed up?” Herbie asked.
“It was a disaster. Corruption, bad engineering, ethnic conflict — it all came together around this plan.”
“Were you there when it happened?” Raefe asked, now curious.
“Most of it, yeah,” Rod said. “Truth? It’s still going on.”
Something clicked for Raefe.
“Somebody told me about a guy who was trying to stop it — Goodstuff Benjamin. Ever hear about him?” he asked.
Rod laughed. “Goodstuff? Everyone knows about him. Everyone has an opinon, too.”
“No kidding,” Raefe said. “I didn’t know he was such a big deal. What’s your opinion?”
“Complicated,” Rod said. “Goodstuff, he has the right idea. In Nigeria, corruption and screwing up the environment are almost the same thing. In the old days, it was just take the oil and run. Then the big global agripharm companies realized that Nigeria was one of the best places in the world to both get oil and grow crops. So they could integrate the whole chain: take the oil, make fertilizer, genetically modify crops for higher yields. The generals were very happy to help. But Goodstuff’s followers, they were the losers in the process. Their land suddenly had oil wells on it and their water was polluted. Their farms were stolen for a pittance by Monsanto Takeda. They can’t even buy seed anymore without having to buy engineered seed, and that means they have to buy the enzymes to activate it, and they can’t afford that.”
“But?” Raefe said, sensing there was another side.
“Goodstuff is a talker, “ Rod said. “He’s like the preacher on Sunday. He tells you about the promised land, but somehow, you can never quite reach it. And the generals got sick of his preaching, and they chased him back into the forests in the North. Up there, the jihadis are after his ass, too.”
“Good taste in enemies,” Herbie said.
I feel like I have to meet this guy eventually, Raefe thought, but how? How was he going to find a guy who was basically hiding from fanatical warlords in rural Nigeria? Maybe Lina would have some ideas. And even though he knew that Nigeria was quite far from Kenya, it was certainly closer to her than Boston. He was going to have to find a way to cross that ocean.

            <Text>The Big Meeting
Traveller’s Perch, 
January 23, 2049
Far Flier had never felt the waveform so volatile at a Guardian Council meeting. It wasn’t the number of participants that made it so difficult to tune everyone in. Aside from himself, there were only representatives from the five departments—— Green from Timelines, Hanikori from Administration, Putnomo from Discovery, Tanoch from Ambasssadors and Manulo from Analysis — plus Diver, summoned to explain events on Earth. No, the difficulty was in finding a wave that encompassed the full range of emotions that were brought to the meeting. He felt fear, arrogance, sadness, puzzlement, anger, gloating — not much to build resonance on. Disagreement was common among all peoples, and certainly the Guardian Council, but this was more. It felt like a will to avoid agreement, as if it were some ancient virus.
“Our task as a council,” he began neutrally, “often involves difficult, even impossible, dilemmas. Our tradition has always been to stare these directly in the face. To brave the complications they entail, to find the solution that is most faithful to our principles and our mission. I ask for your help now in coming together to discuss the matters at hand. We have two key issues in front of us. One is the recent crisis on Earth — what happened, what was done, and what should come next. Two is the proposal from Discovery to launch a new initiative, a project aimed at developing a lightspeed engine. Let’s start with Earth.”
As soon as he had acknowledged the lightspeed engine project, the waveform had begun to coalesce more firmly. So this is what they really want, he thought. Why the emotion attached to it?
“Representing Timelines,” Green started, “I want the Council to understand that at least one timeline shift was made without our participation. We know from past experience that any number of bad things can happen when this ability is used without proper care. That is the entire reason that Timelines was created as the newest part of the Guardians. Was it an Ambassador who initiated this shift? And can they explain why?”
“No Ambassadors are trained enough to accomplish a shift,” Tanoch replied, “even if we were so inclined. What evidence do you have that it was an Ambassador?”
“I received a request from Diver for a suitable timeline,” Green said. “And not long after, the shift was made.”
“Diver?” Tanoch asked.
“Green is correct,” Diver said, “but his account is incomplete. I made an initial query because I was concerned that Earth’s general situation was deteriorating. I wanted to begin thinking about alternative Earth’s for my contacts. Green gave me some insight into those options.”
“And I warned you against trying to send your contact into his past to relive his mistakes,” Green said.
“Of course. And I made it clear that I was not interested in that. But you are wrong to say that you did not participate in the shift.”
“Nonsene,” Green fired back. “We had nothing to do with it.”
 “Precisely. The situation was dire,” she said. She broadcast the records of the volcanic collapse and the tidal wave. “I had only a short time to rescue Raefe or his consciousness would have died with him. You were made aware of this.”
“Diver is correct,” Manulo interjected. “Analysis confirms both  her assessment of the situation on Earth and what she told Timelines.””
“And what was the response from Timelines?” Far Flier asked, leaving it vague whether he was addressing Manulo or Green.
“I received no request from them for more information,” Manulo replied. “Typically, that would be the first step in planning a shift.”
“Because no shift had been authorized by the Council,” Green said. “I can only carry out the will of the Council.”
“But you knew there wasn’t time for that,” Diver said.
“I knew you didn’t have time for that,” Green said, “but whose fault was that? You had already anticipated that a shift would be neccessary, yet you never bothered to inform the council.”
“A good Ambassador always considers many potential outcomes,” Tanoch said.
“Yes, precisely,” Hanikori said, “and prepares for them.”
“You misunderstand my meaning,” Tanoch said. “If every Ambassador came to the Council every time they saw that the potential for a time shift had risen to a level where it was worth thinking about, we would be in constant session. I think the record suggests only that Diver was correct in her assessment. None of us can predict the future, only see vaguely the shape it might take.”
“Let us rise above the level of petty disputes about the facts,” Far Flier said. “The facts  are not in dispute. Diver made a request to Timelines, and Timelines answer was to follow procedure. Do we all agree on that?”
He could sense the frustration from some of the Council who had come hoping to discredit Diver, but no one objected to his characterization.
“So the question before us,” he continued, “is whether Timelines was right to stand on principle even if the outcome was disastrous. Especially when that principle was essentially a bureaucratic one.”
“You say that as if acting to shift the contact could not also bring disaster,” Green said, unyielding. “Let me remind you of the Orion disaster, when certain Guardians caused the collapse of an entire civilization across many timelines by repeated shifts without considering the consequences or even stating clear expectations of what they hope to accomplish.”
“Yes, we are all familiar with that unfortunate incident,” Far Flier responded. “That was why, 150,000 years ago, Timelines was founded. Tanoch, did Diver’s training not include the lessons learned from Orion?”
“It most certainly did,” Tanoch said. “And I can feel that you are going to ask whether her actions in this case could have initiated such a spiral. My answer is no. The key feature of the Orion incident was that the Ambassador involved developed a method whereby he would direct his contact to a certain course of action. If it did not work, he would analyze the shortcomings, shift the contact to a very similar timeline and then direct him to a refined course of action based on the past failing. Ultimately, the Ambassador fell in love with his own analysis, which was on its own incorrect, and inadvertently  directed his contact to repeat this in ever more effective  ways. The contact, instead of becoming an agent for progress, became the chief architect of a conflict which, once started, could not be stopped and rampaged on for centuries. In the end, the species wound up destroying itself.”
“And I understand that,” Diver said. “Raefe was merely a victim of a natural disaster brought on by centuries of inaction. The only thing he has learned is that Armageddon is a real possibility.”
“Yes, Armageddon is a real possility for all civilizations, even our various ones,” Far Flier said. “And that is why our nurturance of humans is important, more important than our own rules. Our mission is to create the conditions for intelligent life to prosper and survive. Whatever inconveniences, messy situations, loose ends or confusion that brings, we must always keep that foremost in mind. I would hope that in the future, Timelines would adhere to that mission.”
Green remained silent.
“Fortunately, Raefe has been relocated to a more advantageous timeline. Diver, you have entangled with him. What are his prospects?”
“Good, I believe,” Diver answered. “He is a bit disoriented. His situation is actually more stable: he has a job, decent housing. I’ve been talking to him about second chances. The notion that his second chance is also a second chance for his species. I am expecting it will take some months, maybe a few years, before he is able to translate that into meaningful actions. My plan is to encourage him to seek out others who he might join with. He is not a charismatic leader on his own.”
“Hang on,” Hanikori interrupted. “How did you shift him without the cooperation of Timelines?”
Diver hesitated. “I didn’t…”
“I did,” Far Flier interjected. “Analytics had made me aware of the crisis. Once Diver told me of the issue with Timelines, I took the necessary steps.”
“How interesting,” Hanikori answered. “I was unaware that anyone but Timelines could actually access the quantum multiverse interface needed to shift someone to a new timeline. In fact, in Administration, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that each department is compartmentalized, so that no Guardian can hijack the system for their own agenda.”
“I am surprised to hear you say that,” Far Flier answered. “You know that as Coordinator, I have the ability to access any systems. Perhaps you were unaware that in my early days in the Guardians we still practiced a system of rotation for trainees. Most of you are aware that every so often I participate in your department’s work. I’m not sure how a Coordinator can function, really, if they remain completely ignorant of what we do as Guardians.”
“I will only register my concern, then, at your interference. A matter for another time,” Hanikori said.
Far Flier could feel the waveform oscillate between those who agreed with Hanikori and those who didn’t. There was no clear consensus. He was actually relieved that there wasn’t more support for Hanikori’s attempt to open the can of worms. He would be gracious and move on before someone thought to ask about Lina.
“Quite,” he said. “We have much to talk about with the second item, the lightspeed drive project.”
“Yes, indeed,” Putnomo said. Everyone had sensed his growing impatience. “You have received my brief. Let me summarize. Some preliminary work by the Science team has revived interest in lightspeed travel. We are exploring some very promising new physics that will unlock this possibility. Rather than having to accelerate toward lightspeed, with all of the energy consumption and relativistic effects that entails, this new physics points to instantaneous lightspeed.”
“Given that we have effective faster than lightspeed transmission of information through wormholes, what do you see as the benefit?” Far Flier asked.
“What if there was intelligent life that was just bad at entanglement?” Putnomo asked. “Perhaps that is even the more common scenario than being capable of it. We would never know about these species. But this new approach will allow us to contact such species, at the least.”
“Does the physics suggest that this work could lead to FTL drives?” Far Flier asked.
“It doesn’t rule it out,” Putnomo replied. “Still early days.””
“You foresee a program of exploration?” Tanoch asked. “What part of the galaxy could be reached within the lifetime of an enhanced being?”
“Most of it,” Putnomo said. “Direct contact with life anywhere in the Galaxy should be possible, coupled with instantaneous communications of results through the wormhole interfaces. The combination will be very powerful.”
“So you see perhaps robotic vessels conducting a survey?” Manulo asked.
“That would be for us to decide, but yes, that is one scenario. Right now, my concern is to get the project into prototype mode, to build a working small-scale engine,” Putnomo responded.
“Might I ask more about the physics?” Manulo said. “What is the basic principal?”
“It’s quite complex, really,” Putnomo answered. “I’m broadcasting some reference materials if you want to dig deeper. But the short answer is that we think that by combining advanced plasma control systems with vacuum energy modulation, we can instantaneously transform the plasma into very high levels of light pressure.”
Far Flier made a mental note to investigate the science more thoroughly. Putnomo’s description didn’t quite make sense and he felt skepticism from Manulo as well.
“What would you need from the council?” he asked Putnomo.
“The project will require a doubling of the energy budget and staff allocations for the entire Discovery department. It would mean a redefinition of our basic goals.”
“What you mean” Tanoch said, “is that you would shift your activities away from supporting the Ambassador’s mission, isn’t it?”
“No,” said Putnomo. “We would change what is available to the Ambassadors. Now they can merely entangle with a few individuals. This project will enable them to identify new species, and perhaps even someday, to go beyond this galaxy.”
“But until lightspeed technology actually works, and we can use it for the Ambassadors,” Tanoch pointed out, “you would essentially be allowing the current effort to stagnate, betting on a future replacement.”
“Unless our home worlds are willing to give greater support to the Guardians as a whole,” Putnomo answered. “That is not for me to decide.”
“Then I suggest that I ask each Guardian species to consider their stance on this,” Far Flier said. “Ultimately, they must decide what future direction we want to take as Guardians. I will proceed with that. When we know the answer, we can meet to discuss again.”
Both sides accept this, Far Flier thought. I wonder why.

            <Text>Citizens of Nowhere
Kiunga, Kenya
January 19, 2049
Lina was glad to put Kiunga behind her. As beautiful as the coast was, she was only helping to destroy it. As cloistered as their life in Mombassa had been, here she felt not only isolated but alone. For more than three months, she had been trying to absorb the still-unreal notion that part of her had lived a totally different life until last November. A life that had been meaner, more difficult, but also filled with the companionship of a nice American boy. A life in which she had been her own guiding star, had found her own way in a new country. It gave her hope for her own future, but at the same time made her current state of affairs more troubling.
Still, after two months here in the boonies, it would be good to return to her life as Milima in the bustle of Mombasa, spend time with her parents, look up some of her friends from school and see how they were doing.
After awhile, the town gave way to the countryside. The road became less formal, and by the time they turned right toward Mararani, it was hard track but flat and in good shape. There was little but savannah in every direction, quiet as the heat began to rise in mid morning. Still, the two Chinese guards in the front of the bus had their rifles at the ready in case raiders from Somalia struck. With the Coastal Friendship Alliance logo on it, they would know it was likely to be all Chinese passengers. For some, that meant “Stay away.” For others, it advertised “People with money onboard.”
She thought of what she would say to her father when she got home. She knew that it was not really his decision to send her to the port construction project. He just couldn’t bring himself to admit that he couldn’t protect her from his superiors. Since she had gained her empathic powers, she had seen much more deeply into the complex web of emotions that was her father. He had given up a lot to marry her mother, and their Milima was a concrete reminder of his dalliance with an African. She knew that sometimes he wanted to tell the Coastal Friendship Alliance to drop dead, but each time, he could not see how that would make their life better. He felt they wouldn’t be accepted by the locals and they’d have no protection from the Chinese.
He was in a tough spot. She thought he underestimated the Kenyans. After all, people of all sorts had passed through here for as long as there had been people. But it would require him to not just leave the CFA, but to leave behind his Chinese identity. As much as the CFA questioned that he still had one, she knew that he was deeply invested in his heritage. So when they had suggested that his daughter could continue her computer studies by working on the harbor project, he could not refuse. That much she had sensed from him.
Still, gouging out one of the world’s last remaining viable reef systems to build oil rigs and a deep water port was not something she could do for long. She could still remember her teeth vibrating deep into her skull that day on the other Earth as the whole ground and the air around them began to hum with the approach of that impossibly huge wall of water. If you saw something like that once, you simply couldn’t be part of it happening again. Not that she could tell him that.
Her thoughts were interrupted by a loud noise as the right front tire blew out. The driver struggled for control, bringing the vehicle to a halt with front wheel in a ditch, but the bus still upright. No one was hurt.
The  guards were on their military-band radios — there was no mobile service out here. She couldn’t hear them, but their faces were enough to tell her that all was not well. She could feel their fear. One of them motioned toward to come to the front. Puzzled, she walked to the front.
“Miss Yang?”
“Yes?”
“Captain Li in Kiunga would like to talk to you.”
She took the radio. The guard pointed to the large button on the side and then his mouth. She pressed the button.
“Captain Li?”
“Miss Yang, thank you. We need your assistance. According to our records, you speak Swahili?”
“Yes, I do.”
“Very good. The bus is disabled and it will be some time before we can send a vehicle to replace it. There is a village called Mangai about a kilometer from where you are. We would like all the passengers to walk there with the guards. When we get there, can you translate for the guards? We only want to let the locals know that we mean no harm and ask for their help for a few hours.””
So they must be in an area that was not totally secure.
“I hope so, Captain. I speak Mombasa Swahili. It’s like Chinese, you know — the vowels are sung. Up here in the North, they don’t. I suppose it’s like the difference between Chinese and Japanese. But I think I can make myself understood and understand them. That’s sort of the point of Swahili.”
“Thank you. We will send help as soon as we can.”
There were about 20 of them altogether, and they set out walking in the direction they had been driving. The land on either side of the road was grassy, with occasional small groups of antelope or deer. Farther off the road, they could see that the trees thickened on both sides. There were no signs of people anywhere that Lina could see. But after a half hour, she saw smoke rising in the distance. One of the guards had binoculars and told them it was a village.
As they walked around a bend in the road, there were four Kenyans in the road. Two men, a woman and a boy. They were trying to shout something in Chinese, but no one could understand them. Lina walked ahead, waving in the way that Kenyans did so that they could see she was a local.
“Hello. Our bus is broken,” she said in her singing Swahili. “May we stay in your village until help comes this afternoon?”” Closer now, she could see the people wore the gauzey white pantaloons and tunics of the local Muslim tribes. The woman had a blue print scarf  covering her hair.
“You are welcome to stay,” the woman said in her flat Northern accent. “It will be safer for you. I am Imani. These are my brothers, Juma, Kamari and little Rashid.”” Lina suspected that they would not speak directly to her, as an unaccompanied woman.
“Thank you. I am Milima Kawambai Yang. Safe from what?” she asked.
“Shabab,” she said plainly. “They claim all of Lamu is part of the East African Caliphate. What you call Somalia.”
She wondered if her father knew that the Chinese government was investing in a war zone. It was news to her.
“I didn’t know they were here. Do they come often?”
“Now and then. You should tell your friends to put their guns away. If any Shabab see Chinese with guns, they may think they are soldiers and attack them. They are not happy about Chinese coming here.”
Lina told the guards, but she knew they would not put away their rifles. Juma and Kamari led all the passengers into the village, a jumble of old-style huts and cinder-block buildings. Past the village were fields where they tended  small herds of goats and cattle, as well as a large garden.
Imani brought them all to small pavilion in the center of the village. Some long tables sat under a tent-like covering, the sides open.
“You can stay here until your people come,” she said. “The elders will come to meet you soon.”
Lina explained what was going on to her fellow travelers. The group was tense, anxious for help to come from Kiunga. But with her new abilities, she could also sense anger — some of the group was feeling that they had been sent into danger haphazardly, their safety unimportant. 
Knowing that deep dissatisfaction lurked underneath some of that smugness pleased her. She could not remember her childhood in her other life, but nonetheless she felt sure that it must have been her exasperation with the smugness of her father’s people that had driven her to America. She shrugged the feeling off. Maybe she had as many pasts as futures, but those pasts were hidden from her. They couldn’t help her now. 
The guards thanked her for her translation and introduced themselves. Zhang Lei was short and stocky, with bad skin and a squint. Wang Tao was taller and leaner, with a wry smile.
“Do you live here in Kiunga?” Lina asked. “I haven’t seen you around.””
“No, you wouldn’t,” Wang answered. “There is a small military base south of Kiunga, just past Rubu. We stay there.”
“Oh, I hadn’t realized you were in the army,” she said.
“That is good,” Wang answered. “Our commander prefers us to appear as civilian security guards. He says that we work under the Light Footprint policy.””
“What is that?”
“Foreign Minister Wei Peng has said that when we Chinese come to other countries with food and technology in our arms, our feet should not disturb the ground our hosts walk on. In this way, we bring improvement without disturbance.”
Unless the disturbance is below the water, she thought bitterly. But she detected not a hint of irony in either of the soldiers, and bit her tongue.
*****
Lina had gotten used to the quiet nights of Kiunga, but Mianga was in another league entirely. Near midnight, almost everyone was asleep. She could hear a video faintly off to her right, and muffled conversation somewhere behind her. But all around her was the sound of birds, frogs, insects and the occasional growl of some sort of big cat. Before turning in, she had walked to the edge of the village. Looking up, the inky river of the Milky Way was as vivid as she had ever seen it. Every so often, a meteorite streaked across the sky. She wondered where in that sky Far Flier lived.
Now, lying on the cot Imani had set up for her, she allowed herself to remember what it had felt like when Raefe and Far Flier had together touched her mind. It had all happened so quickly and she usually forced herself not to dwell on it. Raefe had become something of a ghost to her. They had worked a scheme to chat on a popular site, but she only did that from net cafes in Mombasa. A direct vid call was too risky. How would she explain him to her parents? Her father’s bosses might read something sinister into a relationship with an American, given the two country’s uneasy relationship. But here in the bush, remembering the vastness of the cosmos, she could feel the power that her mind was still growing into. In high school, she had been on the track team. She remembered the feeling of lacing up her shoes, stretching her hamstrings, exploding out of the blocks, and that glorious rush as her head came up and the track was hers. The sky, the village, the villagers — they felt a little like that track had.
Her cosmic musings led her deeper into her mind, and soon, she was asleep. Suddenly, she someone was shaking her.
“Wake up, we have to go!”
It was Imani.
“Hurry, Shabab is coming! We must leave.”
Lina grabbed the gym bag with her things, stepped into her shoes and hustled out into the deep night, joining a stream of villagers. They were trotting down a path leading away from the village toward the forest. No one talked. She could feel that they had practiced this, perhaps actually had fled before. She felt their fear, but also their determination, and a kind of pride that they were doing this together.
She tried to ask Imani where they were going, but got only a sharp look and a finger to the lips for her trouble. It slowly dawned on her that she was the only person from the bus in the column. As they continued their escape, she lost the thread of feeling the other Chinese travelers. For now, she was an African, jogging for her life with two hundred other men, women and children. After nearly an hour, they stopped.
An older man, seemingly the leader of the village, quietly directed several younger men to act as sentries. They fanned out, each stepping just off the track into the forest so as not to be seen.
“Here, have some water,” Imani said, offering her a water bottle.
“Thanks,” Lina answered. “And thanks for waking me up.”
“I couldn’t leave you there.”
“But you left the other Chinese travelers.”
“Shabab will hold them for ransom, or to extract something from the Chinese government. If they get what they want, they will let them go. But you…”
“Because of my hair, and my darker skin?”
Imani hesitated. Lina grasped her discomfort.
“Oh, of course. They would think that I am the child of a prostitute and therefore worthless for anything but rape.”
Imani’s face betrayed her surprise at Lina’s insight. “Yes. They rape us too, but for other reasons. To show our men that they are powerless against them. And they would take some of us back to Somalia as so-called wives.”
“But you are all Muslim, I don’t understand.”
“All their praise of Allah is garbage,” she growled. “They are bandits. When the UN set up drone planes and submarines in 2042 and finally made it hard for them to be pirates, they turned their eyes away from the sea. Now they kidnap and steal.”
“And Nairobi? They don’t help?”
“They are the government. They don’t need to kidnap to steal. As long as Shabab doesn’t send too many soldiers, as long as they only prey on small villages and leave the cities to the government, the army would rather spend its money on itself.”
“So you come here and hide for a few days and go back?”
“No. The construction project at Kiunga has changed everything. For Shabab, this is a giant opportunity. Many foreigners to kidnap. Money to demand from the government to leave the foreigners alone. People will hear about how Shabab stood up to the Chinese and the government, and that will help them get more young people to join their army. Shabab means ‘‘youth’ but they have grown old and need young blood now. They will not leave us alone in Mianga. We go deep into the forest. There are people who will take us in.”
Water break was over. The group resumed their double time march in silence broken only by soft whispers to “pay attention” to the sounds of large animals in the forest on either side of the track. The children were now in the center of the column, the younger ones on the backs of the largest men, the older ones able to run and keep up. For the big cats in the forest, probably leopards, the whole group of them must have looked like a dangerous herd. Apart from the occasional growl or strong scent of musk, potential predators were invisible.
Daylight revealed that they had been running along a slight ridge, perhaps 10 meters higher than the land around it. They were walking now. One of the women had a sat phone with a GPS. They had put about 20 kilometers between themselves and their village. Several people huddled around the phone talking and Lina could make out that they were looking for high ground to reconnoiter. The woman pointed to a fork in the track ahead, and they took the right-hand path. A short time later, they found themselves on a bald, rocky hill. Without the trees to block their view, the high point gave them a view in every direction.
Looking northward, the forest sloped downward for half a kilometer. Beyond that, there were grasslands as far as the eye could see. The view to the south was different. A kilometer or two away, something more than a stream and less than a big river meandered westward as far as the eye could see. Lina could make out a small lake, a pond really, in the distance. For a second, she thought she saw a flash of light from the woods on the far northern edge of the lake. South of the river, the forest continued unabated but seemed to change color in the distance. 
She borrowed binoculars from one of the sentries. The color change marked different, denser forest. Probably the northern edge of the coastal mangroves, she thought. Sweeping back toward the lake, she could see flashes of movement at the far end of the lake and a variety of small structures. Perhaps she had seen sunlight reflected off one of the metal huts.
The group continued their march, now a brisk walk, headed toward the lake. Everyone was more relaxed now, talking, trying to make the best of it. But no one would tell her anything about where they were going other than, “you’ll see, you’ll like it.” She thought about asking the woman with the sat phone if she could use it to call her parents, but what did she have to tell them at this point? She was sure they were headed for that lake, but she’d wait until they got there.
They had descended into the forest again, unable to gauge their progress. Just before 3 in the afternoon, they emerged into a large clearing, filled with dozens of  small buildings. There seemed to be three or four hundred people about, busily going about their day. No one seemed surprised by their arrival. Lina guessed that a sat call had been made.
The Mangai villagers were met by a group of people who seemed to know some of them and greeted them warmly. Imani took Lina to what looked to be a dining area — tables under a canopy — in the center of the village. A tall, reedy, cinnamon-colored woman came to greet them.
“Welcome,” she said in Swahili. “I am Edna. I speak for the village council. You must be Imani. And you must be Millima. Please, sit. We have some water for you. Are you hungry?””
“Yes, indeed,” Imani said. “We left in the deep of the night and had no time for food.”
Edna waved to some young men near the tent and asked them to bring food. “We will have a proper feast for you later, but we have some left over lunch for you now.”
Lina was impatient. “What is this place?”
Edna smiled. “It is Kakuma.”
Lina laughed at the Swahili word for nowhere. “Well, I never saw it on any map, but really, where am I?”
“I will explain,” Edna said. “But first, the council has asked me to discuss your situation with you. Shabab has taken your fellow passengers on the bus hostage. They’ve presented demands for money to return them. Are any of the hostages your friends or family?”
“No, I’ve only just arrived in Kiunga. My family is in Mombasa.”
“How is it you came here to work for the Chinese?”
“My father is Chinese. He works as an engineer in Mombasa.”
“So your father works for the CFA?”
 “Ah, so you know them. His bosses suggested that my college studies would be more effective if I put my learning to use on the project in Kiunga.”
“So your father is not very high up in CFA?”
Lina laughed. This one was sharp. “No, not at all. Why do you ask?”
“You will be reported missing. What happens next could depend on who you are, who your family is.”
“Huh, I hadn’t even thought of that. I was actually hoping to contact my family when we reached here. Just to let them know I’m okay.”
“You can do that in a little while. But we have to discuss what happens after that — will you go back to Kiunga, to Mombasa, to somewhere else? We have to figure out how to do that without endangering this village.”
“I don’t understand.”
“When I said you are in Nowhere, I was not playing with words. Nowhere is not just our village, but our country. Look around you carefully. What do you notice about the people here?”
There looked to be about 400 people in the village. They definitely weren’t one ethnic group — the people were of many shades and shapes. The closer she looked, though, she couldn’t recognize for certain any one ethnic group she was familiar with. They wore a mix of traditional clothing from several ethnic groups and even a bit of Western clothing.
“There are many kinds of people here, but it is hard to identify their ethnic group by clothing or hair or jewelry.”
“I am very impressed that a foreigner would notice that,” Edna said.
“I am not a foreigner. I was born here. My mother was born Sauda Kawambai. As you can see, I speak Swahili like any Mombassa girl.” But she had a feeling that Edna knew that.
“And yet you are Chinese.”
“Look, what’s this all about? Right now, I’m just a person.”
Edna beamed at her. “Yes, right now, you are like us. Citizens of Nowhere.”
“You mean…”
“Yes, most of us have been driven out of our homes by soldiers, bandits, pirates. Most of those who drove us out did so under the banners of country or faith. Or progress, like your father’s countrymen. And the people who had protected us before that, it was the same. Always two sides, always life and death which side you belong to.”
“And you have not chosen sides?”
“We have chosen our side. The side of people, living life. Together.”
Lina stilled her mind and let the woman’s words wash over her. She could find no deception or irony or self-delusion in the woman’s thoughts. This was what she believed, for sure.
“Cool.”
Edna laughed. “Everyone will be very happy to know that we are cool.”
“No, I mean it. I have lived what you described. My parents love each other, they are not at war. But I have been a battlefield for their cultures, who each see me as a traitor. Almond eyes, kinky hair, thin lips, skin like neither. I never heard of Nowhere. But I have been called No One, in so many words, for as long as I remember.”
“Maybe the don’t see you as a traitor, but as a living example that no one group is better than another. So they make your life hard to prove that it is easier to be one of them.”
“Yes, I fear you are right.”
“But the world has changed, and it is not easier to be one of them, whatever that means. Here in Africa, we should know that better than anyone. The first people lived here — I mean right here — more than 150,000 years ago, and the people who came before the first people, too. They left behind forests like these, and grasslands like the ones around Mangai, and walked along the coast line your project is destroying, living on shell fish, and walked all the way to Asia, and later to Europe and America. Many thousands of years later, their descendants returned here, as if they remembered the richness of the place. And they began the great mixing. I am from Ethiopia —— in my face you can see Arabs who returned to Africa many times over thousands of years. You can see the Hindus who came here to trade. The British, the French, just as I can see the Chinese in your face. Now, the whole world is churning, all its peoples mixing. All this fighting over ‘them’ and ‘us’ — you might as well fight a typhoon!”
Lina shuddered, the memory of the hurricanes from her old world suddenly alive. She could feel Edna’s passion under her serious demeanor, and glimpsed her concern.
“Still, how do you keep all of that out of here?”
“We do what we can. When people come here, they must leave certain things outside. Whatever they believe in their heart, there is no room here for superiority. No religion is better, no nationality, ethnicity, class. Whatever it is they remember fondly about their old life, they must share. They must cook a meal, celebrate a holiday, wear a certain color —— and for those  for whom this is not our tradition, we must partake with an open heart.”
Lina was impressed at the idea, and she could also feel Edna’s pride. “Really cool!”
They both laughed.
“What is it you want to do, Millima,” Edna asked, her expression once more serious. “Do you want to go back to Kiunga or to Mombasa?””
Lina scanned the village, noticing more details about the people. She saw now that there was a deliberate mixing of styles, as if the people of East Africa had had a big swap meet and exchanged fashions. She touched their minds as best she could. There was nothing special she could detect, except perhaps a quiet confidence. A calm.
“Maybe, yeah, I don’t really know.” she answered. “Can I stay here, at least for awhile? If I could just let my parents know I’m ok, I’d love to stay. I can work, I’m not just a student. I’ll earn my keep.”
“You can stay as long as you like. After a week, you must decide if this is for you, and if it is, you must agree to our ways. We have our rituals, too. We can talk about that. As for your parents, we can get word to them. But they cannot know our location. No matter what you intend, the Chinese will put pressure on them and they will send helicopters and soldiers to rescue you. Nowhere will then be Somewhere, and it will no longer be our home.”
“How do you keep it a secret? Don’t people leave on their own?”
“Yes, they do. We have our ways of remaining hidden, though. All in due time.”
They move, Lina could sense the answer in Edna. Nowhere can be anywhere. They must do it every now and then, and very carefully.
“You can get word to my parents soon?”
“Yes. Imani’s village will return. We have made a deal with Shabab. The villagers won’t tell the Chinese where to find Shabab, and Shabab will leave them alone. We have a special relationship with Mangai village — our secret is safe with them. One of them will let your parents know that you are safe.”
“And what about the people from my bus?”
“That will have to play out between the Chinese and Shabab.”
She knows they will be killed, Lina thought. Shabab already knows the CFA won’t ransom the bus travelers. They were all low-level workers, except for the two soldiers. And they sealed their fate by not dying defending the bus.
This is what I died for, she thought. What I gave up Raefe for, what Far Flier changed me for. To learn what it feels like to put aside hatred and fear, to join with ordinary people. This is a start. My parents will be hurt, but I cannot change that my life will always bring one or another of them some pain and regret. Let it at least mean something.
“I sense that you are thinking very deeply about this,” Edna said. “I want to say that we would be very happy to have some one such as you who can bring us experiences and knowledge from places we have never had the chance to go. But I also want to say that you must not think of this as some kind of sacrifice, some kind of martyrdom.”
Lina was startled. Now it was Edna who seemed to be reading her mind. “I confess, you are not far off what I was thinking. What should I think of this as?”
“As a decision you can make, or not. Many people take a new name when they join us, to signify leaving behind the names that mark their family and clan and culture. I took the name Edna. In my language, it means rebirth. For me, this is both a new way of life and actually an entire new life itself. Like a butterfly from a cocoon.”
“Let me spend a week in your cocoon. Then let’s see where I will fly.”</Text>

            <Text>Game on
Cambridge, MA
January 23, 2049
Something tugged at Raefe’s consciousness, pulling him back from the intricacies of wiring up Titan Towers, the new sim game his team was working on. Without turning around, he knew that Mike, his boss, was walking across the floor to see him. What he couldn’t tell was why, but at least he didn’t feel anything overtly hostile.
“Hey, Raefe, got a minute?” Mike asked. Raefe turned around, acting vaguely surprised.
“Sure, Mike, what’s up?”
“How far along are you on the Titan sim? 
“Pretty far along. I’ve plugged in all the physics algorithms — local gravity, Jovian gravity, solar radiation, that kind of thing. Herbie is working on the projectile stuff —— asteroids, comets and so on. All I have left is to install the low-G effects and then the behavioral algorithms. How will people react to solar storms, alien attacks? You know, the usual.”
“That’s good, sounds like we’re in the home stretch. You do a lot of these sims. Do you like the work?”
Uh oh, Raefe thought, danger ahead. He still couldn’t feel any serious negativity from Mike.
“It’s fine. If you do a lot of these, you start to see that they’re all pretty similar. On the one hand, you’ve got an environment with built in limitations and threats. On the other hand, you have humans who have a range of probable responses to each other and the environment. And you want to make this opaque but not invisible to the players. They want to discover what makes the sim world work, and master it. But the outcome is always known — life or death, rich or poor, win or lose.”
“No flies on you. That’s a pretty good summation — a lot of guys take many years to see that.”
Raefe blushed. Had he said too much?
“Anyway, I suspected you had a pretty good handle on it, because I usually see your name near the top of the efficiency reports I get. Now I know it’s probably because you’re quite clear about what to do and not that you’re using mind enhancing drugs.”
No, not repeating my old man’s mistakes, Raefe thought.
“Thanks, I guess.”
“Sure. But what I wanted to ask you about is whether you’d want to work on a different kind of sim. Same technology, but different reasons and very different algorithms. And it’s not a game, at least not a pay-to-play one.”
“Huh, sounds interesting. So what is it?”
“Well, it’s part of something called the Civilization Project over at MIT. Have you heard of the Cosmos sim?”
“Where they replay the history of the universe and tweak stuff to see how it all turns out? Sure. Aren’t a lot of our physics codes dumbed down from that?”
“Yeah, because our customers don’t have quantum computers to run the full code. Anyway, in a similar vein, they want to simulate the evolution of society.”
“That doesn’t sound new. Weren’t some of the very first sim games about building a city, or farming?”
“This is not that. They’re starting with monkeys and ending with our world.”
“OK, that’s cool. Yeah, sure, I’d be interested.”
“MiniWorlds is partnering with them on this. In the end, we’ll get a lot of fresh behavioral code that could give us much richer sims. And guys like you will learn new algorithms and new coding techniques. I can’t really explain more than that. What I’d like you to do is go to a briefing at MIT next week. I’ll let your team leader know you won’t be here. Then let’s talk.”

The next day, Raefe took the short bike ride from MiniWorlds to the MIT campus. He was excited. He and Lina talked on and off about what they might do with their empathic powers, how they might contribute to some positive change and avoid the calamity they felt sure was inevitable. Sometimes he caught himself listening to their conversation and it seemed insane that they were even contemplating things on that scale. Maybe this would be his way in — using his talents, influencing something that was already going to be influential.
Still, for Raefe it was a huge step just contemplating being part of a project like this at a place like MIT, even if they didn’t change the world. He was the third generation of public education products in his family. MIT was the elite world, stuffed with corpo kids who’d been prepped in endless tech camps, by private tutors and private schools. They’d come to become the technical elite of the world in exchange for insane fees and perpetual contributions from their parents. Harvard might still churn out the CEOs and CFOs, but the Chief Officers of Technology, Science, Data, Genetics and the rest came out of here and CalTech and Carnegie Mellon and handful of other places like that.
It was exactly the place that had produced Ken Robertson, who ran DigiBrands, which owned MiniWorlds. Raefe had to remind himself that in this world Ken Robertson had not strong-armed the U.S. government into giving him most of the Northeast to pillage. Not yet, at least. But thinking about his other life in the days following the flood tempered his enthusiasm about venturing into the fold at the ‘Tute, as the students called it. Herbie liked to joke that it was really the Toot, as in tooting your own horn. Herbie collected 20th century insults, although he had a pretty good catalog of 21st century ones, too.
His puter guided him to the Laboratory for Computational Civics, a nondescript three story building tucked into the middle of the campus.
“Hi, is this the Civilization Project?” Raefe asked a rather harried looking woman.
“Yes, and who are you?” she answered.
“I’m Raefe Epstein-Miller,” he said. “From MiniWorlds.”
“Oh, finally someone who can actually do work,” she said. “Everyone here is a big thinker. Very nice until you have to actually get something done. Well, you are in the right place. I’m Roshi Farzan, the team leader for the Outcomes team. You’ll be working with us. Come, I’ll introduce you.”
She took him into a large, messy room full of long tables littered with vid screens and various inscrutable gadgets. No one looked up. In his mind, he had envisioned something exotic — maybe inside a geo dome with vids on every surface. This looked like MiniWorlds if it held a high school science fair and all the robocleaners had gone on the fritz. But the visuals slowly gave way to a feeling of being caught in a stream with a surprisingly strong current of intellectual power and confidence. It wouldn’t knock you over, but you would have to mind your step.
He realized he was feeling the combined affect of a dozen very intent, focused and powerful minds in one place, thinking about related things. It was like being in a room full of Divers, except that they couldn’t read his thoughts or talk into his mind. Or could they? This will be fun, he thought.
He realized Roshi was smiling at him, bemused.
“They’re not so fierce,” she said. “They won’t bite.”
“No,” he said, “I was thinking more they will. Bite off big chunks of stuff and digest it. I can feel that big brain energy.”
“Ah, that,” she said. “Not like where you work?”
“Not exactly,” he said. “Plenty of smart people. But we’re just allowed to eat the little chunks that we can spit out quickly into product.”
“Different product here,” she said. “Ours is insight — takes time and luck. Anyway, we need your help and I think you’ll find it engaging. Let me introduce you to your team members.”
Who were a guy named Jim Nguyen and a woman named Elise Pasos. The four of them sat around a small table in the corner — the Lab’s version of a conference room.
“Elise works on quantitative sociology and Jim on simulation kinetics,” Roshi said. Raefe had no idea what that meant, but nodded. Not going to do the whole “I’m just a state school kid” thing,” he thought.
“What that means in this context,” Elise said, “is that I look at factors that have contributed to the rise and fall of societies — civilizations — and Jim develops math that represents those factors.”
“And what we’re hoping you’ll be able to do,” Jim said, “is translate that math into an interactive, game-like environment.”
“And why do you want to do that?” asked Raefe. “Why the game part?”
“Because CivLab is about people,” Elise said. “We want to be able, for example, to ask people to play through different phases of history and see how their behavior changes outcomes. And even interview them about why they did what they did. Some people even want to watch their brains as they play — how much of their actions are driven by logic, how much by emotion?”
“Cool,” Raefe said. “Well, I’m sure I can help. I’ve built dozens of game frameworks for hundreds of games and even some self-generating animated vids. We’ll have to get deeper into how you want them to interact, how many people and so on. But that sounds exciting. Most of the games I help build are either about guns or money — is that the kind of stuff you’re looking at?”
“Part of it — guns and money have driven a lot of history, eh?.” Elise replied.  “But we want to look deeper into issues like competition and collaboration, heirarchy and equality, scarcity and plenty. How does that effect the role of guns and money, for example, in how a society works?”
Yes! Finally I can use my insights about empathy to inform a game, he thought.
“Nice,” Raefe said. “I’m a little bored of creating counters for bodies or coins.”
He lay in bed that night, wishing he could talk with Lina. She was out of touch in some small coastal town, Kiunga. He had been wrestling with himself about just what it was he could do to put his empathic powers to good use. The thought of being some kind of charismatic leader, a Goodstuff Benjamin,  sent shivers down his spine. He just wasn’t that kind of person. 
He had to admit, his new found empathic powers made him feel more comfortable with people. Not that he was shy before, but his headaches always made him feel different from others. Now he saw that difference in a new light, and it was a comforting light. But it was a long way from there to feeling like he could lead an army of people to change the world.
So maybe his role would be to work in the background, make sure everything was on a solid footing. Like the games he worked on; the customers saw the graphics but it was his algorithms underneath that made the characters behave realistically. This civ sim could be like that, too.
He and Lina were set to talk again in a couple of weeks. By then, he’d have more to tell her. But he was excited.

Traveller’s Perch
January 23, 2049

At night, after the council meeting, Far Flier came to her quarters. Diver asked the room to extend an extra chair from the floor.
&quot;I've been waiting to ask you what the galaxy was going on at the last ambassador's meeting,&quot; she said.
&quot;'What the galaxy?'&quot; he smiled.
&quot;Oh sorry. I got that from humans, sort of. When they feel strongly about something, they invoke grand forces of nature or their deities. They say things like &quot;what on earth&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; is going on. I guess in my own mind, I've started saying &quot;what the galaxy&quot; since the galaxy is kind of our world, if you want to look at it that way. It just made me realize that even though they can only communicate consciously through words, there is a richness to their expression that I like.&quot;
&quot;You realize that the distinction between Earth and Hell alone underlies millions of deaths on their world?&quot;
&quot;Indeed. But both words also represent their desire to find a connection not only to each other, but to something bigger than themselves. And that is strong in most of them. Some of them have amplified predator tendencies, more like the solitary hunter species that wander the ruined star clusters of Perseus. But in most of them, that solitary instinct is subordinate to their ancestral habits of large bands, and bands of bands. These two aspects are always at war, and so humans are often at war with each other. Sorry, you didn't come for a lecture, I suppose. I just get lost in them sometimes.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Not to worry, your passion refreshes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot; Diver let him sense that she had moved from anger at a betrayer to the concern of a friend.
“Yes, that would be nice,” Far Flier answered, excepting her olive branch. 
She was cheered that he had chosen to eat with her. It had been thousands of years since their kind had needed to deliberately eat to survive. Their ancestors had enhanced them with a variety of autotrophic mechanisms. As long as there was any kind of ambient electromagnetic energy, they were fine. And they could survive for days on gravity alone, in the rare event they were cut off from light or other electro-magnetic radiation. Eating was now for pleasure or companionship, for honoring the ancient voices that still spoke in their cells.
She brought out some purple fruit slices, and some dried meats with microherbal implants. She thought the codes that activated them, releasing the fresh tastes of the herbs into the  meat. What the galaxy, she thought, and brought out a wine she knew he especially liked.
They ate in silence, passing back and forth the wave function of their taste sensations, washing each other's minds in a bath of taste and aroma and texture. When they were done, he grasped both of her hands.
&quot;You always know how to cleanse my mind, Diver.&quot;
&quot;I'm pleased you feel that way,&quot; she said, pausing to consider her response. “I am still trying to cleanse mine, but I see now that there are no simple paths through the asteroid fields in front of us. I can’t quite see my way to approve of what you did with Lina, but I see that you had few other choices. Maybe no other choices. And that disturbs me more than the deed itself.”
“Me, too,” Far Flier said. “What did you take from the meeting?”
“You are right to be concerned,” she said. “I don’t know what Hanikori and Green are up to, and they don’t seem inclined to open their minds to share it. That’s my first concern. My second is Putnomo’s abandonment of entanglement as our mode of operation. And my third is that Tanoch stopped short of calling his plan just that. Instead, he chose to emphasize the tactical issue of supporting his department while their obsolence is fulfilled.”
That was what was nagging at me, Far Flier thought. “Yet I sense no connection between Tanoch and Hanikori’s faction.”
“Still, I think you were right,” she said. “Even if they are not secretly scheming together, our colleagues are losing sight of our mission. Traveling by lightspeed ship to contact new species? We are not demi-gods whose mere arrival in galaxy spanning spacecraft would demonstrate our overwhelming superiority. How could we be seen any other way? The other day, I was furious with you for doing that on a very small scale. But nothing has ever said ‘superior race’ more than aliens appearing in a highly advanced space ship.”
Far Flier was quiet, considering her words. Then he smiled.
“I hadn’t put that final piece together, but now that you point it out to me, you are right. But there is more to it than that, and I have promised not to have so many secrets from you, so I am going to tell you something that very few people know. And it should stay that way, at least for now. Are you willing to abide by that?”
“My head says no, but my heart knows that yes is the only real answer here.”
“Your head will soon agree,” he said, relieved that she seemed to understand the stakes. “Putnomo’s presentation also made me uneasy for another reason. Something didn’t add up. As I told you, I have many friends with many kinds of expertise, including advanced propulsion systems and plasma physics. I asked one of them, in loose terms, about Putnomo’s project.”
“Let me guess,” she said. “It will take even longer and cost even more than he suggested.”
“It will take an eternity and cost nothing,” Far Flier said, “because it is a fraud. It can’t be done.”
“What do you mean, a fraud?”
“My contact says that the project rests on several technologies. One main focus — plasma containment and control — has a solid foundation and the general goals of more advanced control and higher yields are ambitious but reasonable. But then Putnomo makes a leap from better engines to instantaneous acceleration to lightspeed. That is not an engineering problem — the universe won’t allow it.”
“What if he’s discovered some new physics?”
“Undoubtedly he has,” Far Flier said. “Putnomo makes vague allusions to a new technology that can entirely transform ordinary matter into a sort of three-dimensional, self-contained coherent light wave within a plasma cloud, and then reverse the process upon arrival.”
“So that’s how we travel at lightspeed? We become light, and then revert back to matter on arrival?”
“At its heart, that’s Putnomo’s project. But my sources say that this is simply not possible. There can never be a 100% faithful transformation of matter to energy and back to matter. To put it simply, we can send our thoughts anywhere. We can send our bodies anywhere. But if we send our bodies as thoughts, and then recreate our bodies from those thoughts, they will be randomly different at the quantum level in a random number of ways, ranging from moderate to massive differences. But whether slight or massive, those differences could mean we won’t survive the trip.”
“Well, scientists often disagree, don’t they,” Diver said, wondering where he was going with this.
“But that’s the thing,” Far Flier said. “This disagreement was settled thousands of years ago. And this particular detail of Putnomo’s plan was buried in his proposal. Only a few people — fortunately my friend is one of them — could see deeply enough into this to see it’s rotten heart.”
“What do you think it means? What is Putnomo up to?”
“I think it means that Putnomo wants to develop something crucial to Hanikori’s agenda, and knows that its true nature must remain hidden.”
“And what do you think that is?”
“I have no idea. But I’m afraid of what it is. And I don’t think I can let this go — I fear that their project is something deeply, fundamentally wrong.”
“If your friend is right, they are certainly behaving as if they know you and many of the rest of us won’t agree to it.”
“Will you help me to uncover this secret, and if I’m right, to stop them?”
Suddenly, she understood what Raefe must feel. All of her talks with him must sound like this: There is a world you know nothing of, but I’m asking you to trust me. And I’m asking you to change your life in ways neither of us yet understand.
“How can I refuse?” she said, her lips tightening in a grim smile.

            <Text>Becoming Lina
January 26, 2049
Tomorrow will be one week, Lina, thought. I’ll have to give Edna my answer.
For six days, they had walked north and west through the Kenyan brush. The farther they went from the coast, the land became drier, the plants shorter and sparser, and the noise of birds and insects gradually shrunk from a symphony to quiet conversations. It was the same with people — villages gave way to smaller villages, and eventually just to goat herder’s huts. Hours could go by without them seeing any sign of other people.
With no distractions, and surrounded by hundreds of Nowhere people, she had used her  empathic abilities to tune into their feelings. It fascinated her that although they spoke many languages, she could tune into their feelings without any problem. Emotions seem to have a universal deep language and structure. She had learned to distinguish a couple of dozen of them, which had surprised her. She never realized what a large palette of  feelings we had to color our world. And she could feel there were many more that she couldn’t quite yet bring into focus.
This morning brought no secrets, though. She could feel a weariness beginning to set in. The land had become drier and flatter. They had to hew to the forests to remain unseen, the trees dividing their ranks into many small braids. The adults grew more wary, constantly scanning for hyenas or other animals that might try and pick off small children if they wandered away.
“Today I am not the only one tired of walking,” Lina said to Edna.
“I’m afraid you are right,” Edna smiled. “But we are close now.”
“To what?”
“Do you see in the distance over there, the woods?” Edna asked. “We will be there soon, and then we will stop.”
“What’s there?”
“New Dabaab. But then, you probably don’t know what old Dabaab was.”
“You mean where the Iranian Air Force bombed the Islamic State in ‘39?”
“Yes, the very same. You were just born then?”
“Yes, but my mother had family that were caught up in that. They were all killed.”
“I’m sorry. Dabaab had a long history before that, and it was even then more than the last hideout for Islamic State. If you had come here 40 years ago, you would have seen a tent city of more than 300,000 people. Refugees from this war and that. That’s how Islamic State came to be here, after they were run out of Egypt. But their comrades in Iraq and Syria, or what was left of those places,  were still making trouble for Iran.”
“My mother didn’t talk about it much,” Lina said. “But she always insisted her family had nothing to do with Islamic State.”
“They were invaders,” Edna said. “By the time they came here in ‘36, they had shrunk a great deal. But they were still armed, and they were able to take over the camps. The UN had run out of money and left the tents to the refugees, who made the best of it. By ‘39, there were still more than 50,000 people here.”
“My relatives were probably some of those refugees. What happened to all of them?”
“They were, in many ways, the first Citizens of Nowhere. The world heard that the bombings killed 11,000 Islamic State fighters, but there were barely 2,000 by then. The rest were just ordinary people, caught in the fighting. Killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
So many people, she thought. And no one really knew. One of the great slaughters of our time, and it never officially happened.
“With every day, I see more of what you mean by Nowhere.”
“It was an awakening for us. Then and there, we had to decide whether to live, die or become ghosts. We chose to be living ghosts.”
“You were there?” Lina asked, stunned.
“I was a young girl, still not a woman. Yet I became mother to those who had lost theirs. For a week, we lived in the midst of fire and smoke, like violent spirits who had been herded  into the middle of the camp. When the smoke went away, we thought we would smell the breeze again, the familiar smells of the bush and of the camp. But there was only death around us. When all you can see in every direction are the dead, their sight and smell become one horrible overwhelming sensation that you cannot escape. Even if you close your eyes, you still smell them so strongly it feels like you can see and touch them, all around you. Each time you breathe, you have left the world and are in hell.
“In that time, I understood that I had died and had to will myself and those around me to be reborn. But not just to live as before. That just didn’t seem possible, to endure a hell like that a second time. At first, the imams and what was left of our village leaders tried to gather us for prayers and funerals. But the old rituals brought no comfort, no sense. Certain people wandered off and found each other, somehow, in a quiet bend in the river. They sent word and I came with other young people. We talked for days and in the end, we understood that Nowhere was now our home. Eventually, a few thousand of us joined this new country. We split up into different groups and dispersed to — to Kenya, to Nigeria, other places where we could quietly live unseen. And we come here when we lose that, to regroup and make plans.”
Memories of the Efricar civil war in her other life exploded from their hiding places. She had escaped the worst here in this world, but it was not far away. She let herself feel Edna’s emotions. They were the same rage and deep sadness the rape and killing of her other life had brought. But she could feel that though Edna had these deep feelings, she also had learned to put herself outside them now, in this place she called Nowhere. Lina realized that since her other self had joined her, she had lost her sense of belonging in this world. But now, she felt at home. She wanted to tell Edna all of this and about Raefe and what the future held for all of them. She thought Edna would understand, might even be an empath herself. She would talk to Raefe about it, maybe even Far Flier or Diver. They would figure it out together and they would move forward now, for the first time since Truro Island. There would be no turning back.
“I want to be part of those plans. I will continue on this path with you.”
“I think you have been on it for a long time, even before you met us. And what will we call you now, Citizen of Nowhere?”
“Lina, call me Lina.”</Text>

            <Text>Very long distance romance
February 7, 2049
Raefe hadn’t heard from Lina in three weeks. At first, he chalked it up to her being out in the bush somewhere around Kiunga. A quick look at the satmaps showed there was, indeed, a lot of bush around Kiunga and little else. But if he’d woken up worried, he was beside himself now. Overnight he’d gotten a message from her mother, who had heard through the Chinese government that she had escaped a kidnapping and was safe, but now somewhere in the bush.
It was almost 6 months now since he had been with her, in their other life, on that island, minutes from death. How had they let it go this long and not found a way to get together? He closed the window shade, turned off the room light. He folded his bed back into a couch and sat on the edge, as quiet and still as he could. He closed his eyes and thought of her face. A moment from when they had just met returned, one of the few memories he had of that life that was older than a year. They were sitting at a coffee cart in Union Square; he couldn’t quite remember the name. It was a beautiful spring day and the coffee exploded in his mouth in a shower of bitter splinters, chocolate, and molasses foam. He smiled and she laughed. Her face filled his mind’s eye — her anarchic curls, her cinammon skin, the slightly square nose that seemed neither African or Chinese — and a fountain of longing burst from inside him toward the sky.
And then he felt something back. A brush of fingertips raising the hair on the back of his neck. A whisper in his ear making him alert. A keening. And then it was gone.
He sat frozen, afraid to move even a millimeter. After a minute or two, he felt the desperation of knowing she might not come back and a cry flew out from inside him. Had he actually shouted it, or was it just in his head? He wasn’t sure.
“Raefe, are you OK?”
Who was it? A woman’s voice, not Lina’s. A neighbor?
“Can you hear me?”
It was Diver.
“Yes, I forget sometimes you can come when I’m awake. You heard me crying out?”
“I heard both of you.”
“You heard Lina?”
“Yes, she heard you but could not hold on to your thoughts.”
“Wow, I didn’t expect her empathic powers to be that strong. I was really just reaching out in desperation, no expectations.”
“You both are much stronger now. Empathy builds its own strength.”
“You have to tell me — is she OK?”
“Yes, tired but safe. She can tell you all about it.”
“I don’t think I can wait until I see her. I’m going crazy here.”
“I will find her and connect you,” realizing in that moment that this was what Far Flier had done on Truro Island. Yes, but I am only strengthening an existing entanglement, not rewiring someone’s brain without their knowledge. Yet she realized she would do exactly that in this moment if that was what it would take to keep Raefe going. I am no better than Far Flier, it would seem.
Only a few seconds later, Raefe felt fully another mind. He had never experienced more than his one to ones with Diver. It took him a second to tease out the two streams. Now he could sense Lina, and his head was filled with warm light. He had a million questions and he sensed that so did she. He tried to speak, but he felt her thoughts flooding into his mind and great streams of ideas flowing out of him toward her. Seconds, minutes, many minutes — he had no idea — passed and then he felt his mind settle.
“I will leave you now,” Diver said. “I think you have much to say to each other and little to me.”

            <Text>Not just a game
March 22, 2049
First thing Monday, Raefe marched into Roshi’s office. He needed time and he needed money to get to Kenya. Once Diver had connected him with Lina, they had sent their thoughts back and forth every time they were able to for the last three days. She was OK, but he couldn’t let her go through this alone. And she thought that there was enormous potential in Dabaab for them to do something. So he needed to get there.
“I never mentioned this, but I have a girl friend, and she’s in some trouble. I need to visit her, soon. And for awhile.”
“Just like that, you are leaving us?” Roshi looked up. “If I wanted staff who were going to do as they please and up and leave, I would get undergrads. And not have to pay them.”
“No, that’s just it,” he said. “I want to work more. I want to know if you can give me more hours, and more money.”
“In my youth, young men talked like that either because they were getting married or getting their girlfriends an abortion.”
“No, it’s nothing like that. She’s in Kenya — that’s where she’s from. She was working out in the boonies and Shabab raided, and she had to flee. Her parents can’t help — it’s complicated — but she needs my help.”
“How much time are you talking about?”
“Maybe a month? But not until I earn enough to get there and back.”
“How much do you need?”
“Maybe 10k?”
“Talk to Elise. She’s stuck. See what she needs. If you can work out a plan where you build them the next phase, you can go off while they do their part and be back in time for when they’ll need you again. I have no money, but I’ll borrow from the end of the project. Timewise, it’ll be the same span as MiniWorlds expected. They don’t have to know what happened between start and finish.” 
“Roshi, thank you so much. I’ll work it out with Elise.”
He ran down the hall to the lab. Elise and Jim were heads down. He told himself to be calm, this was all going to work out.
“Hey, you got a minute?” he asked Elise quietly. No need to bring Jim into the picture yet.
“Sure, what’s up?”
“Can we talk in your office?”
She gave him a puzzled look but got up and they walked over to her office, just big enough for a desk and two chairs. He closed the door.
“Sorry for the drama,” he said, “but I have a favor to ask you. I talked to Roshi and she said I should talk to you.”
“What’s up?” she asked.
He told her what he had told Roshi. 
“So you want to know if there’s some big next thing you can burn the midnight oil to do for the next month, and then take off for a month? Have it got that right.”
“Exactly.”
“I wish there was. I’m sure Roshi told you we’ve discovered very little so far.”
“Stuck was the word she used.”
“Fair description.”
“Maybe I can help. What are you actually trying to learn?” Raefe asked Elise. He could feel her resistance to answering, but couldn’t tell why.
“Listen, if I tell you that, you may tilt the code to help me. It’s only natural.”
“You forget, this is my job. You have a lot on the line — you’re trying to attach you’re name to a certain idea. I’m just doing a job. And I can’t create the right code if I don’t know what the goal is. For me, what you say is just a spec. Soon, I’ll be back doing games for idiots, so don’t worry.”
“You don’t really believe that,” she said, grabbing his forearm. “You have so much talent.”
Ah, now he understood. She wouldn’t just be telling him a spec, but bringing him deeper into her world. For her, this was intimate and therefore complicated. He’d have to think about how to navigate this. Seeing what people felt did not always help him understand how to respond, he was learning that more and more.
“Thanks, coming from you that means something. Listen, do you want to grab a cup of coffee? We can talk this thing through in a more relaxed way.” He thought she needed to get out of the pressure cooker of the lab if she was going to consider something new.
“Sure,” she said, just the hint of a blush in her cheeks. “Can you give me 15 minutes?”
“Do you know where Izzy’s is? Why don’t I meet you there?”
“Down Windsor Street?”
“That’s it.”
*****
“I’ve never been here,” she confessed.
“What?” Raefe was incredulous. “You’ve been at the Toot for six months and never had the best coffee within half a mile? Never mind the empenadas.”
“In Brazil, you must not be so casual about going to sketchy places.”
“Why do you think it’s sketchy here?”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend,” she said, clearly uncomfortable. “Poverty is everywhere in my country, and you have to develop a sense of what is dangerous. Look at that housing complex across the street — it looks like one of those Gangsta vids from my grandpa’s day. People watch those vids in Brazil.”
“Here too,” he said. “Fifty years ago, it was what they used to call a housing project. Mostly people from the Caribbean. It had some drugs and violence, but even then, it wasn’t so bad. But that’s how Izzy’s got started — this was just  the food the people across the street were used to eating. Now it’s all perfectly harmless young people of all sorts. Small, cheap apartments for kids out of college slogging it out in entry level jobs. So they added Mochacinos and Cubanos to the Bustelo for coffee choices, and they have low-carbon salads. Solar greenhouses and all that.”
“Those are all college graduates living there?” she said, somewhat startled.
“That was me my first year at MiniWorlds,” he said. He felt her try to absorb the implications of that. He could sense her immediate and instinctive response was that she was somehow now associated with the underside of society, that she was in the wrong place. And then she scolded herself, both for allowing that which had been hammered into her to surface and for fearing him and people like him. 
“I think maybe you don’t have such a clear picture of life here,” he said, trying to put her at ease. “The Toot is something of a bubble — most of the Americans and all of the foreign students come from pretty elite backgrounds. Most of them would share your preconceptions.”
“But not you?” she asked, her thoughts saying she wanted to unlearn her prejudice.
“I went to UMass, the college run by the state. It’s a good school, but it’s for the foot soldiers — when you get out, you go into teaching, or city government. Or coding, or managing a small biomanufacturing team, or triage officer at a clinic. You’re not likely to become a banker or a high level manager. Hell, you probably won’t even be a software architect, a bio research team leader, or something like that unless you get a bit lucky or are just surprisingly brilliant.”
“But you are so smart,” she said.
“Thanks,” he smiled. “Got it from my dad. My father was one of the last of the old-time coders. He could actually write thousands of lines of code, create whole applications. Back then, they had huge libraries of functions and components. He knew half a dozen different ones like the back of his hand. He worked on the big power grid renewal projects, after the Slide exposed how weak the old grid was. He spent about 10 years working on and off doing that. It was good when the money was coming in, bad when it wasn’t. By the time I was in middle school, when he was done, the first tech like CodeEngine was coming out. He knew nothing of that. He couldn’t get a job for two years.”
“What did you do?”
“Well, my mom was still teaching, so we had a little money coming in. I had a bunk bed from when my older brother was younger, and we rented the top bunk out to various people, which helped a bit. But eventually we had to move to a smaller apartment. And then we had to go on Min.”
“Min?”
“Minimum Standard Living Allowance. Basically, the government pays you to eat and sleep if you can avoid breaking the law.  And then my Dad  taught himself how to install solar panels and moved off to Oregon, so we got off that. I’d already been accepted at UMass so I stayed behind.”
She stared off to the side, taking it all in. He could feel her wrestling with this new information, trying to put it into some context that made sense to her.
“I have not lived in a bubble as much as you think I have. Maybe someday I will explain that. But clearly, more than I thought.”
“No worries.”
“No, it is a worry. Lies, so many lies. In science, we know everything we believe is both right and not fully right, and we are always looking for something more true. And sometimes, we foolishly think the whole world works that way. And then someone has to slap us and show us the lies in front of us. Anyway, thank you for telling me that.”
He could feel a mountain of sadness and anger in her, something in her past. In her homeland.
“I just wanted you to understand that you don’t have to worry about me getting too involved,” he said. “I don’t want to — I know I’m a guest. It’s a great project, I really enjoy it. But I know it will end, and I’ve always known that. But this is the most meaningful work I’ve done yet and I want to contribute. If you don’t tell me what this is really about, I can’t.”
“Well, it’s what Roshi explained — that we’re trying to recreate the evolution of society through simulations so that we can understand what the most important variables are.”
“But nothing we’ve tried has worked. Not even close.”
“Not your fault,” she said. “Think about how we have structured it.”
“We’ve tried giving the players more food, less food, more education, less education. Health, housing. I don’t feel like we’ve missed much.”
“But we have,” she said. Suddenly, her thoughts flashed in front of him — an image of a lone Paleolithic hunter, then a group of them. Then a woman struggling to plug a hole in her grass hut as flood waters rushed in, then an image of a tribe all pushing logs together across a rising stream.
“What? Behavior?”
“Yes, very good. Listen, you don’t have the full picture. Do you know who is funding our work?” she asked.
“No, actually. I never thought about it. I just thought, well, the Toot does stuff like this.”
“Yes, they do,” she smiled. “But most of the research here has some kind of corporate or government funding to it. We are not doing science for science sake, as an old phrase went. We are doing science for someone’s sake. In this case, it’s the Reagan Institute.”
“Never heard of them. What’s their deal?”
“Their deal is to keep free market capitalism alive.”
“I thought it was already dead,” he said. “Didn’t we move on after the Slide to social capitalism? We have the Min, and Basic Home, Health and Education and Workforce Entry.”
“And yet here we are, sitting across from a former slum where now highly educated youth struggle to pay the rent, as you have now informed me. One of the advantages of being in the bubble, as you call it, is that people find it necessary to speak a little more openly to their fellow bubble residents. What do you think governs just how Min and Basic social capitalism is for those who depend on it?”
“Ah, I see where you’re heading,” Raefe said. “The elite do. They’re not giving it all up just because some person got elected president by promising a new day.”
“And the elite fund things like the Reagan Institute which tries to scope out policies that will keep the poor from revolting while still allowing the elite to retain and grow their wealth.”
“And why do they care about the evolution of civilization?”
“Actually, they could give a flying fuck about the evolution of civilization,” she said, with more bitterness than he had expected. “This project has a hidden agenda — what is the minimum level of resources that the minimum number of people will require from, as they see it, the wealthy, or more accurately, the worthy, in order to keep society from collapsing? At the end of the day, all the wealthy conceded from the Slide was that they had to give some ground. Like the man who finds out that he can still rape women, but must be satisfied  with only one or two victims a month. And not expecting them to smile.”
“And then announces that the threat of mass rape has ended,” he said, wondering if she was speaking from personal experience.
“Yes, my smart friend, exactly. So what we have been doing is seeing what happens if you cut calories by 20%, or reduce family allowances to tilt toward just 1child, and so on. Roshi actually believed that we could learn about human society this way. But Roshi is not a computational person. She came from the qual side and doesn’t see why this won’t work.”
“I guess I don’t understand either.”
“I’ll try and explain. Think about astronomy in the Renaissance. You started, in 1300, with Europeans believing that Sun revolved around the Earth.”
“And then Copernicus disproved that and showed the Earth revolved around the Sun.”
“Well, not exactly. What Copernicus actually did was to take ancient Greek ideas about the planets moving in perfect circles and make the Earth move in a perfect circle around the Sun, inside a perfect sphere. He wasn’t so sure about the other planets, though, and he and the rest of the scientific community — they called themselves natural philosophers back then — played with all of these variants. What if the outer planets moved around the Earth, or inside other polygons, and so on. The point is, their model of planetary motion was missing the most essential element: what makes the planets move at all, and in the way they do?”
“Right, gravity. Newton figured that out.”
“Mostly, yes, and almost 300 years after Copernicus.  And then Einstein made it true on the scale of the universe. In the meantime, none of their existing astronomical models — simulations, if you will — explained the known past, the present, or the near future of the planets. Things you could see with your own eyes — the coming of spring, a lunar eclipse, the rising and setting of Mars — these could not be accurately accounted for in their sims. Nonetheless, they kept tinkering — adding a little here and a little there. Until Newton saw that it was all governed by underlying, universal forces.”
“And that’s what we’re missing?”
“Your simulation code, at our direction, is basically a long equation that that’s something like ax + by + cz, with many more variables. When our subjects play it, we see what happens when we make “a” bigger, or “c” negative. But the relationships between x and y and z stay the same. If society really worked that way, we would have proved it already. But it doesn’t. Because we’re asking the wrong questions. Actually, we’re being paid to ask the wrong questions, because those are the questions our sponsors want answered.”
“And you want to know what’s the gravity of social evolution?”
“Yes! Exactly. We want to give Reagan some answers, but their whole question is flawed. So we’ll hack something out of the data and it will be years before they realize it’s meaningless. But Jim and I desperately want to advance the question in a big way.”
“So how do we do that?”
This time her smile was actually happy. “I thought you’d never ask,” she said. “We need you to hide certain dynamics in the code, and then show us how to run the game so that we can satisfy the grant, but also do what we want. And Roshi can’t know, much less the RI guys.”
“You understand that every game I build is just a projection of dynamics on to a set of contraints?”
“Maybe. What do you mean by that?”
“Every day at my usual job I take a game engine that takes input, puts it through some algorithms, and then feeds it to game rules, which then feed it back to a visualization engine. And I hook it up to different customers’ game rules and visualization engines.”
“You’re saying that the input, the data normalization algorithms, the game rules and the visualization are all separable?” she asked.
“Now who’s the smart kid? They are already separated. There’s no reason why I can’t  feed the normalized data through two sets of rules — yours and theirs. We can store your game rule output and then you and Jim can run the vids after hours and see what you can see.”
“That’s fantastic.”
“You should have asked me sooner.”
“Yes, I can see that now.” 
They agreed he would spend the next month working day and night to build the second set of rules and the plumbing to run two sims off of one data set and deliver two outputs. One would be for Reagan, one for Elise and Jim. Elise assured him she’d handle Roshi and smooth it out. Once he had completed the code, they’d do a short QA cycle. Then he could go off while they had people come in and play the games. Some would see the Reagan output, some would see the real output, but they’d get usable data from both. When he got back, they would move on to the final phase of fine tuning the game based on what they’d learned from the new rules.
Later, he found Lina. It was late there, but she had been waiting for him. She hadn’t expected that he would be able to pull this off so soon, but she was more than excited to hear that he would be there soon. And she wanted to know more about this sim; it meshed with things she had observed in Dabaab. 
“Funny how this is working out,” Raefe said. “We were two kids scruffling to find a place, and then we were driftwood washed up on an island. And now we’re head-skyping about shit that’s all cutting edge. And we’re on that edge.”
“You’re going to be amazed when you get here,” Lina said. “It’s like visiting the future.”
“As long as we don’t have to visit the past.”</Text>

Traveller’s Perch
February 24, 2049
Diver was nervous and happy at the thought of a quiet dinner with Far Flier. Her contact with Raefe and Lina had revealed immense progress for both of them. She hoped Far Flier would see this as the beginning of regaining their mission. Involving him in the good news would be a way to demonstrate that she had put her reservations about his behavior aside without him having to apologize or her having to admit she had been hasty in doubting his motives. If neither of them could claim the high ground, at least they could gaze toward it together as friends and colleagues.
She looked around her apartment and sent it an image of the space without the front wall, extending the floor out over the canyons below in a sort of patio. At the edges, she thought of a low curving wall with a spongey covering that the two of them could sit against and look at the sky. She realized she was thinking of the dinner in a romantic way and that she wasn’t even surprised. Feathers as Green as Third Spring Grass had been right, of course. Diver and Far Flier had become a couple around the time she had taken the Earth assignment. But they had been casual about it. She had slowly explored him against the backdrop of her excitement about leading the Earth mission. And he had been willing to keep things that way.
Since the incident with Lina, their time together had been strictly work related. But she realized that she missed even their loose arrangement. Did he? she wondered. But her thoughts were interrupted with the sensation of Far Flier approaching. He wanted to know if her balcony was still the way she had left it the last time he was there. She let him see the changes she had made, and he seemed pleased.
Half a minute later, she could see why. He had chosen to fly to her. He swooped down and landed gracefully on the deck, his purple, blue and green colors glistening through the tight mesh of his flight suit.
“Ah, what a glorious day!” he exclaimed. “I’ve been to the Rannikan Hills. This week, the sky is full and you can see the amala herds gathering for their annual mating.”
“It’s been forever since I saw that,” she said. “Were the seven-fruit trees blooming also?”
He smiled. “See for yourself.”
He pulled a sack from a pouch in the suit. There were two of each of the seven fruit. “I hoped you haven’t made dinner yet.”
“No,” she said. “And this will be much better than what I had been thinking of. I didn’t know you were a forager.”
“Now and then. Gliding over the Hills, scanning for food, it has a way of clearing the mind.”
She was delighted. Restaurants sometimes served the seven courses of fruit, but to have them fresh-picked during a full sky, the only time these trees produced all seven types of fruit, was a rare treat. She began to let him sense her gratitude, but realized a better way. She cooed the call that ancient females had used to signal their approval of mating displays.
Far Flier laughed. “I haven’t heard that in hundreds of years.”
“I won’t ask what the last occasion was,” she said. “We should eat them in the ritual order that our ancestors did to thank Red Nest and Water Eye for shining more of Prime’s light, causing the trees to bloom and flower. And I’ve asked the kitchen to make some asterflower wine to go with them.”
“Excellent!”
“If I remember, we start with the makkala, right?” She peeled the two small bright orange fruits, giving one to Far Flier and touching her lips to hers.
“Ah, the tart one that prepares us to taste the others,” she said, her eyes sparkling with delight. “You are one of the few people who understand my love for unenhanced experiences.”
“Very few people have had them, I’m afraid,” he responded. “After thousands of years, our own people have grown dismissive of their ancestors. They discount them as foolish primitives. You know, I don’t think I’ve ever asked you why you cherish these experiences so much.”
“My parents brought me up that way,” she said. “They were biologists who had spent their youth studying some of the more intelligent animals on our planet, like the harangi and the nut birds. They found it helpful to experience those physical environments unaided, to get more of a sense of how the animals experienced them.”
“Is that how they came to be killed in a volcanic eruption?”
“Yes, they had actually followed a harangi troop that liked to bathe in a warm stream that exited a lava tube. They became so engrossed that they detached from the waveform and didn’t hear the warnings.”
“How sad. How old were you?”
“Oh, I was already 204 by then. My siblings thought we should be mad at them for being so absent-minded. After all, so few people die like that from avoidable accidents. But for me, their death made it clear to me that the universe doesn’t care about us, and so we have to care for ourselves. That’s how they lived — they were in their 800s, but still intensely involved with the things that interested them and each other. I miss them, but I have so many fond memories of them and so many of their ideas still rattle around in my head.”
“Well, they were a rarity. Most people these days place little value on unenhanced experiences. And I’m afraid that is true throughout all the species that are part of the Guardians. Most of us have crossed a threshold where we are so intimately related  to each other that we are always empathetic. We would never revert to the violence of past eras. But we’ve come to credit our enhancements for that, not our entanglements, which we created originally without enhancements.”
“Interesting. You have a wider view then me,” she said. “You interface with so many people on and off world. But I see what you say in my students. Recently, I let them experience a bit of life as Raefe does — they watched some popular vids about space travel — and they thought that humans are crude beings who are barely intelligent. I had to point out to them that their low opinion of humans was exactly the kind of thinking they accused the humans of. I hope I can help them elevate their shame into empathy. Ironically, the humans are just starting to do that themselves.”
He handed her the second fruit, the minita. She savored its deep sugary blue flesh while she told him about Lina’s discovery of the Citizens of Nowhere.
“This band of refugees has already left behind the worst practices of their civilization without any help from us. They are all very close to being able to entangle. Lina’s presence alone may help them cross that line. Oh, this is the sweetest minita I’ve ever had!” 
“Yes, this was the perfect day to pick this one. You know you can never get all seven at their best on the same day?”
“I didn’t know that,” she said. “But I always like that it’s never quite the same each time you eat the full course.”
“By the way, I think you may be right about Lina,” Far Flier said. “Strong entanglers can set off a cascade of further entanglement.”
“Hmm. So maybe if Raefe was with her, they’d have a more profound effect on those around them?”
“Yes, most likely. And vice versa — Raefe’s abilities still need further development. Being together, in a sympathetic environment, all of that raises the odds that they can ultimately initiate a durable waveform that other people can tune into. More and more will add to it, and if humans repeat the pattern of other species, within  a few centuries humans will have left behind the era when they could not really understand each other. Once they have come to a deeper understanding of each other,  they will be in a position to really overcome their differences.  But that is still a long way off. I want to hear what is he doing now, but shall we have the alottu first?”
She ate the alottu slowly, making sure its sour vinegary juices didn’t sting her face. In ancient times, the alottu was the reminder of the darkest times,  the rare times when none of the suns shone directly for a few days. These days, it was more of a reminder that life was not always sweet. She quickly drank some asterflower wine to wipe away the taste.
“Wow, that was bitter. So Raefe has been trying to do something technical that uses his empathic abilities. He exchanges his abilities to program computers to a company that involved with a research project that’s trying to understand the relative role of competition and collaboration in human history.”
She explained the complicated commercial arrangements that had led to his assignment as best she could. Far Flier was uninterested in the details of Earth’s economy, but seemed pleased at how things were going.
“Well, all things considered, they’re both in a much better place to have a significant influence,” he said. “All the more reason for us to not make too much noise in the council about what is going on.”
“So it’s come to that?” she asked.
“Yes, for the time being,” he answered. “I’m still trying to figure out what Hanikori’s end game is. In the meanwhile, you should consider involving Adno more. With the spotlight on you, we should consider that she may have more freedom to operate than you.”
The thought sobered her.
“I’ll have to give that some thought, you’re right. She’s pretty green, but learns quickly. Very quickly, as I think about it. When she was assigned to me, Tanoch was somewhat dismissive of her. Have you ever entangled much with her?”
“No, I’ve had no call to,” Far Flier said. “Here, have a glantoch.”
She nibbled at the long thin fruit. It’s bland starchy flavor was meant to neutralize the alottu.
“It’s a different experience than with most of the other Guardian species,” she said. “I can’t put my finger on it exactly. Her mind is always actively checking her location and the location of the rest of her school. She’s never really alone. I hope she can pay attention to Raefe and not be distracted by all of that.”
“Water Eye is an interesting place,” Far Flier said. “It’s still the only planet we know where life evolved for a very long time, and developed considerable complexity, as large colonial organisms.”
“You’re referring to the ancient photosynthetic mats?”
“Yes, but that’s an oversimplification. The mats actually combined plant-like and animal-like life in one organism.”
“Very large organisms at that.”
“Yes, probably less than 100 of them covered the planet. And then the comets struck and all at once the mats were not only broken up but the sea levels rose dramatically. Before the seas covered the planet,  but were mostly about 25 meters deep. After, the seas became much more diverse — shallows, deeps, large underwater currents, temperature differences. And life diversified to fill all of those niches.”
“How did that affect Adno’s people? That was hundreds of millions of years ago.”
“Well, in a strange way. One of my friends studies Water Eye. He is convinced that before the explosion of many different life forms from the advancd mats, the mats themselves had achieved consciousness and some intelligence.”
She saw it now. “So Water Eye is the only place we know of where intelligent creatures evolved from very large to smaller groups?”
“Precisely,” he beamed. “So even now, Adno’s people have a different sense of the individual and the group, the whole and its parts, than all the other Guardian species. To be honest, it’s not clear any of us understand how they see things at the deepest level. Entanglement is not the same as aeons of shared experience.”
Just like Far Flier, she thought, ranging off into the galaxy with all sorts of ideas. He really did need her, she could see now, to ground him. “For the time being, I’ll bring her more into the loop but monitor her more closely.”
“That makes sense,” Far Flier said. “Of course, we don’t want to bring her too much into the loop. Some things we should still keep between us.”
She handed him a small brown cluster of rila berries and ate each of hers slowly. The had a pleasant taste, but their real secret was the energy she would feel in about half an hour.
“I guess I can accept that we cannot be totally open,” Diver said. “But it’s a new feeling for me. Our whole lives are nearly transparent — our first instinct is to allow access to our very thoughts and feelings. Still I want to tell you that I did something with Raefe and Lina like what your did with her.”
“What do you mean?” he asked, a little alarmed.
“Raefe was sent a message that Lina had been kidnapped. He desperately wanted to contact her, but he has never initiated an entanglement with another human, let alone one on the other side of the planet. And she has even less experience. So I connected them — I advanced their development.”
“Well, I wouldn’t beat yourself up about it,” he said. “It was only a matter of a little time before they figured that out.
“Yes, just what I thought,” she said. “But I feel like I have lost something here, some sense of order and rightness by violating our code.”
“If it makes you feel better, I feel the same. The truth is, we have lost exactly that.” 
“Now that we have forgiven each other for breaking the rules we both want to believe in,” she said, “I am still uneasy over the question of how are we different, let alone better, than Hanikori?”
“We are not better,” he said, rising to her challenge with animation and maybe a little impatience. She could tell this was a topic he had discussed many times in his long life. “The entire basis of our civilization and of the Guardians is just that. There is no ‘better’ among living creatures. There is, however, different. And that can only be measured in outcomes — what world do our actions make?”
“But that is why we have rules, isn’t it? Because we have experienced terrible outcomes brought on by certain actions, and so we say ‘never do that again.’”
“Yes, we do. We say that to children. And when they grow up, they discover that sometimes following the rule threatens also to lead to terrible outcomes. And then, they must weigh the consequences.”
“But I don’t know the consequences,” she said. “That’s really what’s troubling me. About both of us.”
“Yes, with all of our technology, our accrued wisdom, our success at survival, life still humbles us after all. We have to guess at things and do the best we can. There is no scientific reason to believe we will ever know the future before it happens.”
“Still, the whole business upset me. The humans have a saying,” she said. “’Rules are made to be broken.’Perhaps that is what they mean by it.”
“Your humans are not the barbarians Hanikori would like the council to believe,” he said. “His experiences with them were as much about his own failings as theirs.”
“I wondered that, too,” she said. “Green told me that Hanikori’s contacts turned out to be deeply flawed. How could he mistake sociopaths for empaths?”
“Because secretly he believes that our abilities and knowledge have transformed us into demi-gods. And he mistook the sense of apartness that sociopaths have for a sense of aboveness. Hanikori is a complex and layered individual, as we all are: his mind rests on the brain he was born with, but he is also enhanced, and he participates in communal thought structures — what we call the waveform. That’s by way of saying that there’s a part of him we don’t see that well that could be considered insane by some definitions.”
She had no words for this. She let him sense her shock and horror, her confusion that one of the leaders of their society and of the Guardians was potentially insane. After 10,000 years, how could this happen?
 “We are only atoms and ideas. This is the lesson of history and of the Guardians,” he said. She could feel a combination of animation and frustration from him that he had to say this, as if it was self-evident. “We are imperfect organic machines, given to paradox and mistake. And the universe? It may obey the laws of physics, but those very laws yield all the chaos and violence of a supernova, not just the beauty of the sunset we are looking at now.”
Diver felt like she had no answer for that. She leaned back against the spongey wall, wishing she could bottle the beauty of the many-colored light that shone down on them and use it to clean away some of the ugliness of life. She knew Far Flier was watching her, feeling her unease. 
“Are you ready for the saforo?” he asked
She hesitated a beat and then smiled at him. “You know, I am. I needed to clear the air with you. Now I know that after we finish this discussion we can just enjoy each other. We can tend to the universe later.”
They took a minute to chew on the green saforo pod. The flesh was tasteless, ironic, since it would heighten their enjoyment of each other’s flesh in a little while. She took heart from Far Flier’s serenity, feeling that they had crossed a small chasm and were now looking at the same view. His mind was still, content to sit here with her and share ideas and food and later, each other’s bodies. 
“The light is comforting, isn’t it?” he said. “Now you see the depth of my dilemma. Think of how shocked you are. You believe me but will the other Guardians? And our own society? Ultimately, I believe they will, and we will be able to undo the damage,” he said, his usual determination infused by a passion she had not heard from him before. “But the coming years will test us. We must be skillful, on the one hand, and yet not let the conflict make us into what Hanikori has become.”
“Have you found other allies?” she wondered. “We should eat the tea melon before it’s too late.”
“Yes, I have other allies but not as strong as you.” He sliced the big teal colored melons into thin slices and put a plate with them between them. Almost as soon as the melon touched her tongue, she began to feel the heightened awareness that it brought.
She cleared her mind and looked at him. As she felt herself sink deeper into his emotions, she realized that he was acknowledging, as best he could, that he needed her. That he depended on her youth and her freshness. That these battles he had been waging in secret by himself had taken a toll on him.
“I am honored that you want to fly into a strong wind with me at your wing.” she said. “Just as you depend on me to have the spirit and energy to carry on, I depend on you to have the insight and experience to know the way. But I will fly these currents with you, if that’s what you are asking.”
And, she thought, I see that he meant that but more, too. Not just to fly, but to nest. This was after all, his plan, bringing the seven fruits. Wise old man! She responded, humming to encourage him. He stepped forward and his arms enveloped her, as the wings of his ancestors would have during courtship. She put her head against his chest and hummed the mating song, feeling the vibrations travelling through her bones and resonating through her feathers. She felt her own arousal, deepened by the saforo, fueled by the rila.
He sang the male song and their melodies crossed and uncrossed, harmonized and countered. She didn’t need the waveform to sense his ardor, nor he to know hers. 
She told the room to close the outside wall. Her bed, a modern abstraction of an ancient nest, extended from the inner wall and the lights brightened, as if the sun were shining on them. She shrugged off her clothes, letting all of her colors shine in the brightness, watching as he did the same.

Kenya
May 4, 2049

Raefe had never experienced much dissonance between the parts of his mind he had been born with in this world and the old one during the seven months they had coexisted. Diver’s promise that they would slowly merge appeared to be coming true. But the eight-hour long plane ride from Boston seemed to provoke a sorting of the two. Neither had ever traveled to another part of the world, nor taken a supersonic jet.
One loved the high-altitude acceleration, the boom and the quiet that followed. The other could only think of how broken down travel had been in his old world. A flight like this would have involved enormous amounts of carbon credits. If it had even been available, only a handful of people would have had the wealth to take it. Most likely, this trip would have meant a solar-assisted sailboat across the ocean, and then a hodge-podge of low-carbon land transit for someone of his means. It would have taken a month, which meant few people would ever have made the trip. Just the rich, who could purchase carbon credits as readily as anything else.
Raefe found himself fighting the idea that this world was headed that way. After all, it had been a great accomplishment only 20 years ago when supersonics had cut global travel times in half. And in another 20 years, this flight would be ultrasonic and the farthest flights would be hypersonic. Boston to Nairobi? Four hours. Boston to Sydney? Three hours tops. This was a clever world. He wanted to believe that the other Earth had merely been stupid or blind, or gripped by some dysfunctional ideology. 
The newer part of his mind assured him that everyone in the old world thought the same things in his great-grandparent’s day, when the temperatures first began to rise to dangerous levels and the predictions of global catastrophe were scoffed at by many. He stared out the window, trying to calm himself. The whole debate was giving him a headache. He’d never had one of his seizures in this world, but the other him remembered them and let it drop.
He took out his puter and read through the code he had delivered to Elise yesterday. He done everything she had asked, creating an entire second sim with completely different algorithms. At first he hadn’t cared much about what the algorithms were. At MiniWorlds, he often didn’t understand the math their clients wanted installed in their games. No matter, all he needed to understand was what were the inputs and what were they outputs. The algorithms themselves were black boxes.
But Joe Nguyen was the sort of person who wanted to explain everything to you. And little by little, Raefe had begun to see how Joe’s code tried to model parts of the world. It was a subtle and complex set of interacting rules, the answers to one rule weighting the inputs to the next, but also modifying itself. How else can we capture the effects of the individual on the group and vice versa, Joe had said. This is the math of the paradox between collaboration and competition, he had proclaimed, with some pride.
And yet Raefe had been left feeling that Nguyen had missed something. Because Nguyen, like most humans, lived with a huge imbalance between the strength of his own thoughts and feelings and those of everyone else. Raefe now lived in that gap between himself and everyone else. And it had made him much more aware. So many things influenced how he perceived other people that he had not been aware of before meeting Diver. Things that he had once thought were his own thoughts, but were really a blend of everyone’s thoughts. What else was culture, after all?
He skimmed through the code, still not able to put his finger on what was missing. Culture was all over Joe’s code, that was not the problem. He read closer, looking to see how Joe had envisioned the workings of culture. And then he saw it. Joe had really not understood how empathy could drive human behavior. Elise had understood him, and Joe had nodded right along, but it was missing its full weight in his code.
The longer he lived with his empathic powers, the more he wondered where it had all gone wrong. When had people stopped paying attention to these feelings? When had they convinced themselves that fear and mistrust were always the wisest course?
He made some corrections to Joe’s code, noting in comments why. He hoped Joe would see it and something would click.
****
In Nairobi, he’d taken a taxi into the city center. From there, it was a 6 hour bus ride straight down the A3 to Garissa. He’d never been to Africa, but from vids and school, he expected to see a necklace of bustling small cities extending out from the capital, filled with low industrial parks made of dozens of agritech plants. For the first hour, he felt like he’d never left Nairobi as they drove through endless neighborhoods with people packed into a random patchwork of shanties, container houses and tent cities. He guessed more people lived here, just on the eastern edge of Nairobi, then all of Boston.
But the houses thinned and then there was nothing for awhile. Flat as far as the eye could see, most of the trees had been cut down for firewood or farming long ago. An hour out of Nairobi, the air had turned hot and dry. He’d once been to Arizona and this felt like that. Then, suddenly about 200 kilometers from Nairobi, Mwingi City rose up out of the dust like a mini Nairobi. And then it was gone and they were back to hard-baked dust with the occasional small village.
A little later, he saw another city on the horizon on the horizon and signs for Bangali City. When they got closer, he could see that the city was deserted. Some farmers were walking a flock of goats down one of the streets. A hot breeze blew dust and various dead plants and garbage through the streets, but nothing else moved.
And then they pulled into Garissam, a town like so many towns at the end of a road. His puter said Dadaab was only another two hours down the road, but his puter didn’t know that normal traffic east of Garissa had stopped a decade ago. Between Garissa and Dadaab, drought had driven even all but the smallest village farmers out. Bandit gangs had taken their place, some of whom were affiliated with remnants of the jihadi militias that had plagued the region decades ago. They made dirt bike runs to attack trucks or the market in Garissa, and then disappeared back into the scrub. All in all, a dangerous place, he thought, anxious about Lina’s safety.
At the bus station, four men with motorcycles approached him. His stomach clutched for a second and then he sensed they were friendly. One of them introduced himself as Malik in halting English and explained Lina had sent them to bring him to Dadaab. Malik gestured to the back of his bike, and Raefe hopped on. He noticed two of the men had short machine pistols slung over their their chests. He wasn’t sure if he should be happy or concerned that they were quite relaxed.
Villages remained scarce. Twice, they’d skirted a village by riding off road. He’d tried to ask why, but the noise of four dirt bikes with ancient, rusting mufflers made it impossible. He could feel something between wariness and fear in his companions’ thoughts.
It’s begun, he thought. The heat, the drought, the breakdown. It’s already happened here.
And then there was a bit of forest and the land rose gently. The forest thickened. They reached a ridge and there it was below, the remains of Dadaab, where 400,000 people had once lived. He could feel many minds below. They felt ordinary, just people going about their business, and it made him very happy.
And then there was Lina, only 100 meters away talking to some people. She must have sensed him because she turned, a huge smile on her face. He hopped off the bike, yelling his thanks to Malik as he trotted toward Lina. He grabbed her up in big bear hug. She was warm and lean and slighter than he had remembered. Gone was the riot of curls, replaced by neat rows. 
“Easy,” she thought to him. “Public affection not so great here.”
He relaxed his hug and she moved back just slightly. They stood grinning at each other.
“Come,” she said, “Let’s get you some water.”
The dining tent was empty and they sat down. He took a long sip of water. Their minds were fully engaged with each other and it felt somehow odd. And then he realized something.
“There are four of us here,” he thought to her. “The two of us who were lovers, and the two of us who have just met.”
“Lina meet Raefe,” she thought.
“Raefe meet Lina, “ he replied. “I think you’re going to like her.”
“Sitting in Union Square, talking fugee biz with Kayam, I never imagined we’d be sitting here,” she said.
“How’s the coffee?” he teased.
“What coffee?” she said. “The heat has killed off most of the lower elevation trees. The high mountain beans are too expensive for locals — it gets shipped off to Europe. Sometimes we get some from Ethiopa, but  bandits have ripped off the last two shipments.”
“Doesn’t seem right, no coffee practically in the place where coffee started.”
“No, my love,” she said. “All is not right here.”
He could feel her sadness, different than what she had felt in their old life when she thought of the Efricar Holocaust. Farther from anger, but wider and deeper. He stared out from the tent. Past Dadaab, the trees were low and sparse as far as he could see, which was all the way to the horizon. There, the line between land and sky was smudged by dust. It reminded him of the beach just after sunset, when water, clouds and sky all converged in slatey blur.
“You thought it would all be jungle and mountains,” Lina laughed.
“Yes, majestic,” he grinned.
“It is the beginning of the changes that destroyed our first life,” she said. “In a generation or two, the fertile coast will be underwater. And this will be a vast desert, a young Sahara.”
“And Nowhere will be nothing?” he wondered.
“Nowhere will be everywhere,” she answered. “Millions, maybe billions, of people will be like these people. Wandering with no destination, no home.”
“Will it be like the East African Holocaust of your other childhood?”
“I don’t remember much of that. I can sense a good deal of it from you since we came to this timeline — your memories of my telling are strong. I can feel some of them, so I know what you are asking. Not to mention that in this very place, my mother’s relatives were part of a slaughter of 11,000 people a generation ago. So I don’t know. These people have so far avoided death from  Shabab, their own governments, and now even the Chinese. But when there are tens of millions of them, what will happen?”
“History says something awful,” he answered. “Can they — can we — change that?”
“I want to think we can,” she said. “I have learned a great deal from these people. They don’t wake up every day with voices all around them telling them to buy, to fight, to be better than the next. They only have each other, and a lifetime of shit has taught them to cherish that.”
“This time last year, we were living in a Bunk under the highway in Somerville. Happiness was a Cubano from Kiko and Kayam’s food trike. Six months ago, we stood at the beginning of the end. Now I’m looking at where the first people lived. And thinking about changing history. Some days, it’s all too weird.”
“I don’t imagine they signed up for this either,” Lina said, jerking her head toward the camp.
“No, you’re right. What do you think we should do?”
“I want to stay here, and be a part of this. I feel like they’re on the verge of something really different.”
He nodded. “I’ve only just got here, but I understand your attraction. And soon I’ll have to go home.”
“Not so soon. We have time to experience, and talk and decide the way forward. I have learned patience from these people.”
He looked skeptical.He had seen many sides of Lina, but none patient.
“Don’t worry, Raefe,” she laughed. “It can be taught.”
Later that night, they walked back up the hill into the forest.
“I think it’s time we introduce new Lina to new Raefe,” Lina said, pointing to a  glade of soft ferns.
Not a stranger at all, thought Raefe a few minutes later  as they left normal conversation behind. Old memories, new thoughts, the ancient delight of warm bodies, the soft battle between rising passions and the desire to make it last forever, their occasional cries all mixed in a sweet gumbo of forest bird calls.
Lying on the ferns, Raefe began to drift off, the warm breeze and Lina’s warm skin merging and lulling him. He began to dream of Lina, naked and glowing, flowing over him, enveloping him. He felt the warmth that was his love for her flow from his mind, down his spine, and through his sex into her. At the same time, he felt her love flowing back toward him, a whirlpool of sensations and emotions where they were joined. His new self guided him, showing the part of him that was strange to her all the places that gave her pleasure. She responded by letting him feel how he felt to her. He returned the favor and they both broke the silence with a laugh. What a strange and wondrous thing this coupling thing was!
The laughter woke him up. He opened his eyes and realized he hadn’t been dreaming, or even really sleeping. Lina had mounted his drowsy body as he lay there but this time their minds had joined too. Now he could see her, and the forest and the sky but had no wish to be distracted from the allness of her. He felt like a newly blind man who had discovered that the world could be seen through touch and taste and smell. As he thought that, he felt her thinking the same thing, and their bodies moved together without hesitation or doubt.
Finally, sated, they lay back, still breathing together. It was still night, but the sun would come up on their new world.</Text>

            <Text>Ambush
May 18, 2049
Hanikori felt the breeze coming up from the canyons, bringing a cool moistness to the plaza. Not many people were around. He had read that this plaza was once part of the last great city on Traveller’s Perch. When the people of the world had become entangled 10,000 years ago, they found the psychic noise of millions of people packed together intolerable. And unnecessary — with their various and fierce internecine conflicts on the wane, the power of concentrated cities gave way to the sustainability of distributed ones. They had spread out, like bright paint on a wet canvas, the drops melding and overlapping to form loose neighborhoods.
Pity, he thought. This moment deserves some drama. What it must have felt like for Cresilion, the last emperor of Traveller’s Perch, to stand atop the ledges, his amplified voice addressing a million people below! Their sweat, their breath, their heat all welling up toward him. And his power reaching down, touching them all. But Cresilion had led the retreat, hadn’t he, from the high civilization of Traveller’s Perch into the Guardian ethos. Well, what choice did he have? The endless wars, the desolation of the water and food — Cresilion had done what had to be done. Yet, something had been lost, hadn’t it?
And now something more would be gained, but all in due time. He sensed Far Flier’s approach even before his network bots informed him that the train carrying the Guardian Council chief was pulling into the nearby station. A minute later, Far Flier was across the plaza, giving a curt wave, his mind closed to Hanikori. Well, he’s no fool, is he, Hanikori thought. I’d do the same.
Hanikori offered him a seat and some alefka to drink. 
“Thanks,” Far Flier said to the offer. “Nice to have a little boost in the late afternoon.”
“Agreed,” Hanikori said. “We’re not middle-aged anymore.” He half-expected Far Flier to correct him, but that would mean acknowledging that Hanikori was, in fact, quite middle-aged while Far Flier was past the halfway point of his life. But he would make that point later, in a more decisive manner. He let Far Flier savor the bittersweet taste of his boiled berries, their mild stimulant properties adding to what his enhancements provided, while they exchanged pleasantries. Still, he could not read the old man’s mood.
“What’s on your mind, Hanikori,” he asked. “I can’t remember the last time we met like this.”
“I thought a frank exchange of views was in order,” Hanikori said. “There’s a lot going on in the Guardian Council these days, and as the two most senior members, I thought we should chat on our own.”
“You’re worried I’ll get in the way of your new lightspeed ship project?”
“Oh, no,” Hanikori said. “That’s well underway. It hasn’t escaped my attention that you’re quite interested in it, though. You think I’ve got something up my sleeve, though, don’t you?”
“No, I know you have something up your sleeve,” Far Flier said, smiling as if he were complimenting him. “And I know it’s something outside of our mission.”
“You see, this was such a good idea. Because it’s our mission that I wanted to talk with you about,” Hanikori said, returning the smile. “I’ve always thought of you as someone who sees our mission as that of a watcher and a waiter. And yet I see now that I’m wrong. You, like me, are much more of an activist.”
“You think so?”
“Oh yes,” he said, enjoying himself immensely. “I see now how wrong I’ve been. It hit me like a hot wind rising from a deep canyon at our last council meeting. Everyone was so interested in Diver and Raefe, but what caught my attention was the girl.”
He paused, but Far Flier didn’t respond.
“You see,” he continued, “I almost missed it, but then it struck me: how did you re-locate her to a new timeline? Raefe, sure, Diver had established a connection with him. I may think he’s a dead end on a dead end planet, but he is a natural entangler. She — is Lina her name? — on the other hand, had shown no such talents before.”
“It’s true,” Far Flier said. “But this was an unusual circumstance. She was with Raefe, who she has a very deep and intuitive tie with. And they were under a lot of stress. Really, about to die — it doesn’t get any more stressful than that. And we’ve seen stress trigger the conversion to being an entangler before. Isn’t that the story of Na’wra? Granted we don’t see it often, but not never.”
He really doesn’t know, Hanikori though. This is just delicious.
“We both know that wasn’t what happened. I’m going to save you the embarrassment of continuing this lie.” He let Far Flier see the data that Green had relayed to him of Lina’s conversion. The data stream showed clearly that Far Flier had orchestrated the whole thing. “You see, I have important and useful friends, too. Even if I don’t spend my evenings with them.”
Far Flier still had not betrayed any emotion. Ever the leader, Hanikori thought, weighing your next move even when you don’t actually have one.
“I can see why you would say that,” Far Flier said slowly. “But I prefer my version. Anyway, you’ve never been much a stickler for the rules before. I seem to remember certain leaders of one Earth country — North Korea was it? — who became quite bizarre around the time you were ambassador to Earth. I’ve always wondered about that — had it in the back of my mind to look into that. Hopefully, your important and useful friends haven’t cleansed the record.”
“My, my,” Hanikori said. “I seem to have struck a nerve.”
“No, I wouldn’t say that. I just find your penchant for theater tiresome. What is it you want?”
“I want the Guardians to benefit Traveller’s Perch and all the other members’ worlds, for that matter. I want the Guardians to stop wasting time and resources on doomed civilizations like Earth.”
“Ah, so you can now see both the past and the future, is that it?”
“Sarcasm is my vice, Far Flier. It fits you poorly. And yes, I can see a bit of the future. I can see that your term as leader of the Guardian Council is coming to an end.”
“You want me to step down?”
“I do. I have no need to discredit you. You can make up whatever story you want. You can take some time to do it. But within the year, you’ll step down. And you won’t involve yourself in the discussion of your successor.”
“I never thought you had the patience to lead the Council.”
“And now I don’t have the patience not to. But I don’t care about the formality — I can work with others.”
Far Flier stood up, his face still blank. “The future, you will find out, is an uncooperative beast.”
It’s done, Hanikori thought. He’s done. Cresilion would have approved.

In her 400 years, Diver had never felt this combination of deep fear and rage that Hanikori induced in her. Far Flier had let her feel Hanikori’s mind through him. From the minute that she picked up his musings about Cresilion as Far Flier approached him, she had the sense of peering inside of a fantastically complex but deeply broken machine. Far Flier had had his suspicions that the meeting would end this way. They had discussed it and she had urged him to take Hanikori head on. She knew that Green had reservations, she couldn’t believe Tanoch would stick by his side. And if it came to it, Far Flier could probably buy off Putnomo by giving him the resources he wanted in exchange for changing the focus of his research to something more socially useful.
But Far Flier thought the rot went deeper, and anyway, that was not Far Flier’s way. He had taken the long view, as he always did. Something had come undone deep inside the Guardians, and little fixes couldn’t change the fact that they were loosing their way in the cosmos. It would take perseverance and courage to reverse that. She couldn’t just sit and wait, though. Not only would she go crazy, but she had to consider that she might be the next one to be sidelined. She had to move quickly now.
She looked for Adno in the Guardian waveform.
“Swimmer in Great Depths,” she called out. It was their private joke.
“Diver, I hope the air is not too dry on you.” Adno replied. “How can I help you?”
“Any news on the humans you are monitoring?”
“As a matter of fact, yes,” Adno answered. “In the area where Lina and Citizens of Nowhere are, I’m picking up more and more low-level empathic activity. These are unconscious attempts to find connections, but they have increased in frequency and intensity since Lina arrived in the area.”
“I’ve been hoping for that,” Diver said, excited to hear some good news for a change. “Anything else?”
“I monitor about 2,000 humans on a random basis. I’m quite sure that these proto-empaths are experiencing the early stages of a transformation. There’s a growing positive feedback loop all around their world. They haven’t yet found each other, but they also are unconsciously attempting to connect and attempting find connection at ever greater rates.”
“Raefe and Lina themselves have experienced a surge in their abilities. I think we’re starting to see an emergence pattern.”
“Yes, I agree. It matches the early empathic histories of some of the Guardian species. Yours, for example. And of course, N’Awra on U Ma at the beginning. Very exciting. Not happened for a long time.”
“All the more reason why we must protect the process. It’s not the best time within the Guardians for this to be happening. There is a lot of internal conflict on the Council. Some members feel this is a waste of resources, that humans are a dead end.”
“I have worked out that this is why Tanoch assigned me to the project. He believes that as a water creature I cannot ever fully understand humans. I will mess something up, in his view. But he thinks that will happen no matter what and this way he doesn’t have to take responsibility. He can blame me, and then you for not supervising me.”
“I don’t understand how Tanoch can think that about you. You were a prized student in the academy, you always did very well in connecting with all sorts of species — air, land, water, whatever. I have full confidence in you, and I need you to continue your efforts with the subjects you’ve identified. But I also need you to keep an eye on Raefe and Lina.”
“I don’t understand, Diver. You are already close with them. What can I add?”
“Nothing as yet. But these conflicts in the Council — I wouldn’t be surprised if I was reassigned. We can’t afford to have a gap in coverage. You need to be able to step in right away. Earth has its own crises and we don’t want to risk losing Raefe and Lina when we’re moving in such a positive direction.”

            <Text>Not just a game
February 8, 2049
First thing Monday, Raefe marched into Roshi’s office. He needed time and he needed money to get to Kenya. Once Diver had connected him with Lina, they had sent their thoughts back and forth every time they were able to for the last three days. She was OK, but he couldn’t let her go through this alone. And she thought that there was enormous potential in Dabaab for them to do something. So he needed to get there.
“I never mentioned this, but I have a girl friend, and she’s in some trouble. I need to visit her, soon. And for awhile.”
“Just like that, you are leaving us?” Roshi looked up. “If I wanted staff who were going to do as they please and up and leave, I would get undergrads. And not have to pay them.”
“No, that’s just it,” he said. “I want to work more. I want to know if you can give me more hours, and more money.”
“In my youth, young men talked like that either because they were getting married or getting their girlfriends an abortion.”
“No, it’s nothing like that. She’s in Kenya — that’s where she’s from. She was working out in the boonies and Shabab raided, and she had to flee. Her parents can’t help — it’s complicated — but she needs my help.”
“How much time are you talking about?”
“Maybe a month? But not until I earn enough to get there and back.”
“How much do you need?”
“Maybe 10k?”
“Talk to Elise. She’s stuck. See what she needs. If you can work out a plan where you build them the next phase, you can go off while they do their part and be back in time for when they’ll need you again. I have no money, but I’ll borrow from the end of the project. Timewise, it’ll be the same span as MiniWorlds expected. They don’t have to know what happened between start and finish.” 
“Roshi, thank you so much. I’ll work it out with Elise.”
He ran down the hall to the lab. Elise and Jim were heads down. He told himself to be calm, this was all going to work out.
“Hey, you got a minute?” he asked Elise quietly. No need to bring Jim into the picture yet.
“Sure, what’s up?”
“Can we talk in your office?”
She gave him a puzzled look but got up and they walked over to her office, just big enough for a desk and two chairs. He closed the door.
“Sorry for the drama,” he said, “but I have a favor to ask you. I talked to Roshi and she said I should talk to you.”
“What’s up?” she asked.
He told her what he had told Roshi. 
“So you want to know if there’s some big next thing you can burn the midnight oil to do for the next month, and then take off for a month? Have it got that right.”
“Exactly.”
“I wish there was. I’m sure Roshi told you we’ve discovered very little so far.”
“Stuck was the word she used.”
“Fair description.”
“Maybe I can help. What are you actually trying to learn?” Raefe asked Elise. He could feel her resistance to answering, but couldn’t tell why.
“Listen, if I tell you that, you may tilt the code to help me. It’s only natural.”
“You forget, this is my job. You have a lot on the line — you’re trying to attach you’re name to a certain idea. I’m just doing a job. And I can’t create the right code if I don’t know what the goal is. For me, what you say is just a spec. Soon, I’ll be back doing games for idiots, so don’t worry.”
“You don’t really believe that,” she said, grabbing his forearm. “You have so much talent.”
“Thanks, but I just wanted you to understand that you don’t have to worry about me getting too involved,” he said. “I don’t want to — I know I’m a guest. It’s a great project, I really enjoy it. But I know it will end, and I’ve always known that. But this is the most meaningful work I’ve done yet and I want to contribute. If you don’t tell me what this is really about, I can’t.”
“Well, it’s what Roshi explained — that we’re trying to recreate the evolution of society through simulations so that we can understand what the most important variables are.”
“But nothing we’ve tried has worked. Not even close.”
“Not your fault,” she said. “I don’t think Joe and I have given you all the guidance you’d need.”
“Well, let’s brainstorm. You want me to code vectors for collaboration, competition, hierarchy, equality, and along various dimensions. National, sexual, and so on. What if all of those things interacted with each other?”
“But don’t we already account for that?” Elise said. “When the economy is going full blast, we weight things one way. When it’s middling another, very poorly, different again.”
“What if there were another force at work, that more fundamentally changed our collaborative behavior, for example?” Raefe said. “What if this force made us more collaborative regardless of the economy or wars or other factors you built in? What if, in fact, another force actually overcame the forces that drive wars or economic inequality? Or if its absence drove them?”
“What are you getting at?”she asked.
“Empathy,” said Raefe.
“Empathy?” said Elise, skeptical. “Why would that be different than any other interpersonal emotion — love, hate, greed — and so on?”
“Because empathy is more basic than that,” Raefe said. “Empathy is hardwired into not just people, but all mammals. And many birds. And who knows what other animals. You look at it as a consequence. It’s actually a complex attribute.”
“Of what?” Elise asked.
“Of being able to understand what your fellow creatures are thinking by watching what they’re doing. Your brain says “Oh, she’s waving. When I wave it means I’m glad to see you. So she must be glad to see me.” And all this happens way below the conscious level, fed by sight, sound, smell, gestures — a whole host of signs we’re only partially aware of. Animals evolved to collaborate within their own species without the elaborate thought processes and communications abilities we have. They have an innate ability to get past the immediate competition for food and mates to remain a pack or herd that travels together, protects their young, distributes their food, and polices their members, up to a point.”
“Holy shit, you’re right,” Elise said. “You’ve just defined civilization, except it’s with animals. We were so focused on technology and resources that we missed that. But given all the horrors that happen in the world — where is empathy then?”
“Exactly, that’s the question,” Raefe said. “How do empathy and self-interest get reconciled in our brains, and then how does that translate to social and societal behavior? Why does it all go so wrong sometimes, and other times, so right?”
“Computational empathy,” she said. “There’s some groundbreaking shit. If only we had any idea of where to start.”
“That’s the thing,” Raefe said. “I think I do.”
“Really? That’s cool. But what if we’re just poking at another surface variable,” Elise said. “What if empathy is itself just a reflection of something deeper?”
Like entangement, Raefe smiled to himself. No flies on you.“Then the sim will show us that. But I’d like to try.”
“That’s great, really exciting. But listen, you don’t have the full picture. Do you know who is funding our work?” she asked.
“No, actually. I never thought about it. I just thought, well, the Toot does stuff like this.”
“Yes, they do,” she smiled. “But most of the research here has some kind of corporate or government funding to it. We are not doing science for science sake, as they used to say in the 20th century. We are doing science for someone’s sake. In this case, it’s the Reagan Institute.”
“Never heard of them. What’s their deal?”
“Their deal is to keep free market capitalism alive.”
“I thought it was already dead,” he said. “Didn’t we move on after the Slide to social capitalism? We have the Min, and Basic Home, Health and Education and Workforce Entry.”
“And yet here we are, sitting only blocks from Windsor Town, a former slum where now highly educated youth struggle to pay the rent, as I’m sure you know.”
“Lived there myself when I was a student. Cafe Bustelo at Izzy’s — best in town.”
“Interesting. Well, here in our elite bubble, people find it necessary to speak a little more openly to their fellow bubble residents. What do you think governs just how Min and Basic social capitalism is for those who depend on it?”
“Ah, I see where you’re heading,” Raefe said. “The elite do. They’re not giving it all up just because some person got elected president by promising a new day.”
“And the elite fund things like the Reagan Institute which tries to scope out policies that will keep the poor from revolting while still allowing the elite to retain and grow their wealth.”
“And why do they care about the evolution of civilization?”
“Actually, they could give a flying fuck about the evolution of civilization,” she said, with more bitterness than he had expected. “This project has a hidden agenda — what is the minimum level of resources that the minimum number of people will require from, as they see it, the wealthy, or more accurately, the worthy, in order to keep society from collapsing? At the end of the day, all the wealthy conceded from the Slide was that they had to give some ground. Like the man who finds out that he can still rape women, but must be satisfied  with only one or two victims a month. And not expecting them to smile.”
“And then announces that the threat of mass rape has ended,” he said, wondering if she was speaking from personal experience.
“Yes, my smart friend, exactly. So what we have been doing is seeing what happens if you cut calories by 20%, or reduce family allowances to tilt toward just 1 child, and so on. Roshi actually believed that we could learn about human society this way.”
“But you have to keep her happy?”
“Yes! Exactly. We want to give Reagan some answers, but their whole question is flawed. So we’ll hack something out of the data and it will be years before they realize it’s meaningless. But Jim and I desperately want to advance the question in a big way.”
“So how do we do that?”
This time her smile was actually happy. “I thought you’d never ask,” she said. “We need you to hide certain dynamics in the code, and then show us how to run the game so that we can satisfy the grant, but also do what we want. And Roshi can’t know, much less the RI guys.”
“You understand that every game I build is just a projection of dynamics on to a set of constraints?”
“Maybe. What do you mean by that?”
“Every day at my usual job I take a game engine that takes input, puts it through some algorithms, and then feeds it to game rules, which then feed it back to a visualization engine. And I hook it up to different customers’ game rules and visualization engines.”
“You’re saying that the input, the data normalization algorithms, the game rules and the visualization are all separable?” she asked.
“Now who’s the smart kid? They are already separated. There’s no reason why I can’t  feed the normalized data through two sets of rules — yours and theirs. We can store your game rule output and then you and Jim can run the vids after hours and see what you can see.”
“That’s fantastic.”
“You should have asked me sooner.”
“Yes, I can see that now.” 
They agreed he would spend the next month working day and night to build the second set of rules and the plumbing to run two sims off of one data set and deliver two outputs. One would be for Reagan, one for Elise and Jim and him. Elise assured him she’d handle Roshi and smooth it out. Once he had completed the code, they’d do a short QA cycle. Then he could go off while they had people come in and play the games. Some would see the Reagan output, some would see the real output, but they’d get usable data from both. When he got back, they would move on to the final phase of fine tuning the game based on what they’d learned from the new rules.
Later, he found Lina. It was late there, but she had been waiting for him. She hadn’t expected that he would be able to pull this off so soon, but she was more than excited to hear that he would be there soon. And she wanted to know more about this sim; it meshed with things she had observed in Dabaab.
“Funny how this is working out,” Raefe said. “We were two kids scruffling to find a place, and then we were driftwood washed up on an island. And now we’re head-skyping about shit that’s all cutting edge. And we’re on that edge.”
“You’re going to be amazed when you get here,” Lina said. “It’s like visiting the future.”
“As long as we don’t have to visit the past.”</Text>

            <Text>Meeting of the Minds
Dadaab
May 21, 2049
Living in Dadaab felt nothing like Cambridge to Raefe. In Cambridge, he was surrounded by a dense fog from which he could sense just the dimmest light of people’s thoughts and feelings. Here the fog was a thin mist and the dim light was replaced by soft whispers, each person a distinct set of colors and sometimes comprehensible.
“I feel like it wouldn’t take much to connect with most of these people,” Raefe said. Maybe it was the way they lived, in neat clusters of small tents around larger tents that were a combined dining hall, workplace and meeting hall. There were already hundreds of these clusters, their lives so integrated and interdependent.
“Some of them, like Edna, are so close to being able to entangle,” Lina replied. “They finish each other’s sentences so often it’s more like someone started the other person’s thought.”
“I asked Diver if she could nudge them over the line,” he said, “but she won’t. She says they made an exception with you and then by connecting us, but we must find our own way. Otherwise, it could turn out badly. But I don’t know how to do that.”
And then he felt hungry, yet happy that it was a cool day. But they weren’t his feelings.
“What was that?” he asked.
“That was Edna’s daughter, Fatima.”
“You can feel her mind that way?”
“Yes, I have been around her for many weeks and know her mind well. But we have grown closer, too. I wanted to see if I could do that, connect your mind to hers through mine. And it worked?”
“That wasn’t just me feeling your idea of her? That was her?”
“Yes, she is a very intuitive person, like her mother. So it was easier with her.”
“But she can’t feel your thoughts?”
“Not yet,” she smiled. “But I have an idea.”
Later, she bumped into Edna.
“You will come to my daughter’s ceremony this afternoon, after Friday prayers?” Edna asked.
“I won’t be at prayers, but yes, for Fatima I will be there,” Lina replied.
“This is your first time, for such a ceremony?”
“Yes. Is there anything I need to know?”
“No, just look for the tent with the red banners near the dining hall at the far end of the camp. Everything will  explain itself. Here, we have so many different traditions we do not worry too much about doing things just so. It is enough to do them at all. I will be with the mothers, and we will sing. Fatima will drink a special tea we will make her, so that she can hear the truth of what we sing. And then we will dress her and she will return to her family and friends a woman.”
And able to entangle, thought Lina. She felt Raefe in her mind, excited by her plan.
“You realize how big this is,” he said. “To see if we can create a whole new kind of human relationship?”
“I’m trying just to think about it like a new kind of puter message,” she said. “One that doesn’t need a puter.”
When the time came, Lina had trouble calming herself. Making small talk with the other women was excruciating.Then the ceremonial tea was served, and Lina found herself slowly being more drawn into the group.
She  had thought through carefully what was about to happen. She would concentrate on Fatima, reaching out, gently touching her mind. Raefe would be in the nearby dining hall, pretending to read a book but actually monitoring what he could of the other women. Since Truro Island, they’d not been able to move their new world off of the same path as their old one. Now, maybe, they could take a first step in creating the kind of world the Guardians seemed to live in.
Edna and a few of her long-time friends began the ceremony. Edna spoke in Swahili, but some of the songs she and the other women sang were in other languages she didn’t understand. Some also sounded like Arabic prayers. Finally, Fatima was brought into the middle of the tent, all the other women around her in a circle. She wore her normal clothes, except for a new red headscarf.
Edna said more words in a language Lina didn’t know. Then Fatima began to sing those words and more in the same language. The song was long, and Fatima fell into its rhythms, her voice now speaking from somewhere inside her.
Lina found Fatima’s mind easily. Lina heard the thoughts in the song, of creation, of every woman’s part in the creation of the world, and of the worlds to come. Lina could feel Fatima’s joy. When Fatima was done, she sat quietly, a huge grin on her face. Another woman began a song, this one a bit racey, about a woman and a man. Certain lines brought laughter from some of the women. No need to translate, Lina thought.
Lina calmed herself and focused on Fatima’s mind. “I am happy for you,” she thought, repeating the thought as in a chant. After a minute or so, she felt Fatima register her presence in her thoughts. The girl was a bit alarmed.
“Why does it seem like Lina is in my mind,” Fatima asked herself.
“Because we are in each other’s minds,” Lina answered.
“Oh, my mother never said anything about this. Is this part of being a woman? Sometimes it feels like the aunties are in each other’s minds,” Fatima thought.
“No, this is just you and me,” Lina said. “We have made a strong connection since I came. I could feel your thoughts easily.”
“Can you read other people’s minds?” Fatima thought. “Can they read yours?”
“It’s not really reading. More like feeling your emotions.You seemed open to it, so I thought I’d try. I think the tea helped.”
“What if I don’t want to share my thoughts with you?” Fatima asked.
“Can you feel this part of your mind?” Lina asked, touching a certain part of her thoughts lightly.
“Yes.”
“Focus on that and make that the center of your thoughts.” She felt Fatima’s thoughts gradually fade way. She made eye contact with her and made a “OK?” face. She felt Fatima come back to her mind.
“We will talk more later, Fatima,” Lina said. “For now, I just wanted to say congratulations.” She felt Fatima’s “thanks.”
The ceremony went on some, but Lina felt drained. She stayed long enough to eat some of the little cakes on offer, and then wandered out of the tent. She felt Raefe reaching out to her.
“I think that went OK,” Lina said.
“You were able to entangle with her?” Raefe said.
“Yes, and she with me. I showed her how to block her thoughts, too. And then she initiated contact again. But it was exhausting.”
“For my part, I could feel other minds sort of paying attention, but no more. I think they felt a disturbance, like a  breeze, but nothing too upsetting.”
“Good.”
She walked to the edge of the camp, wanting to be alone and regroup. She sat on the ground, a tree between her back and the camp. Some large birds were perched on a tree in the distance, their occasional squawks managing to sound both languid and menacing. She could see they were taking turns feeding on a dead animal below them. The warm breezes felt good and soon she felt herself slipping into a dreamless sleep. She awoke suddenly, as if her mind had sensed danger. It was almost dark now and the light was falling like a soft dark curtain. She realized someone was standing in front of her. Lina made herself very still and quiet.
“Who are you?” the stranger asked. It was Edna’s voice.
“What do you mean? You know who I am.”
“Millima Kawambai Yang, now Lina. But who are you really? Are you a witch?”
“Why would you say that?”
“In the tent, you touched my daughter’s mind.”
“She told you this?”
“No, she knows nothing of this. I felt it.”
“You can feel other people’s minds?” Lina asked.
“Yes, a little. Not like a witch, but a little.”
“I’m not a witch. I’m just Lina. I can feel other people’s feelings, and sometimes they can feel mine. I think all of you can almost do it. Your troubles have brought you together. And your ideas have made you open to each other.”
“Why did you touch Fatima’s mind?”
“I feel her thoughts all of the time — she is like a radio broadcasting. I wanted her to feel mine. To talk and feel each other’s emotions better.”
“Can you feel mine?”
“Yes, sometimes.”
“And doing what you do — it’s not dangerous to her? Or to you?”
“No, it’s not that different than when you feel a deep connection with someone. Only now, it’s in words and it’s alive — you’re trading your thoughts and feelings in a deeper way than talking.”
“Teach me to do this.”
“Why?”
“Because if we could all do this, we could heal our wounds and be stronger. We could learn trust. And who not to trust.”
“I’m so glad you said that, because that was my purpose. I have never done this before. Fatima was just the person who it seemed easiest with. I wanted to wait and see what happened. I can’t teach everyone, and certainly not at once. Will you trust me to wait?”
“She is my daughter. I want to protect her if she needs it. If you teach me now, I won’t say anything until you want me to.”
“I will need help — our connection is not yet strong. I might need Raefe to help.”
“He can do this, too?”
“Yes, he showed me how. He is very strong this way. Will you come to our tent around 10? We can see what we can do.”
“I will come with Fatima. I don’t want her to feel alone in this.”
“OK. Edna — I want you to know I would never hurt Fatima. Everything we do, Raefe and I, we have been hurt, too. We want to find a new way to heal. We want to prevent all of this, and worse, from happening to the whole world.” She point with her head toward the camp.
“If you are telling the truth, I will help you. But for now, you should be careful who you say what to. Some people will be afraid of you.”

            <Text>Changing the rules
Cambridge
July 12, 2049
Raefe sat in the back of the small auditorium, watching images flow into and out of the big vid screen upfront. This was what he had come back from Dadaab for — his part of the grand plan, a sandbox to build a new world in. For the visitors, it was the same, only the world they would build with it would be quite different.
His reworked code had allowed the team to fulfill their grant. Enough quantum storage cubes to build a small house with were full of the data his code had generated would keep the RI people busy for years. For the few millions they had spent at the Toot, they would be able to propose wringing billions of dollars of social benefits out of the system with a more informed hope that it wouldn’t spark riots or unintentionally bring the wheels of commerce to a grinding halt. Meanwhile, everyone oohed and aahed as the Civilization Project slides traced their incomplete history of humanity. “Wait until version 2!” was the mantra. All it lacked was a catchy theme song.
When it was done, the RIers went off amid prodigious mutual backslapping to celebrate the completion of the project. Roshi stayed behind.
“When you’re done cleaning up,” she said, “come see me. We have some things to discuss.”
Ah, the work is done and now I’m going to be packed off back to MiniWorlds,” he thought. Not that he hadn’t expected it, just not so soon. He got the room in reasonable shape. No use killing himself on it if he was going to be gone any way. He walked down the hall to Roshi’s office thinking he would miss this place.
Roshi feigned busyness as he walked in, as if she had something on her puter to finish first. He had learned to recognize her little power games over the months. Harmless amusement.
“Well, that went well,” she said.
“Yes, I’m glad. It was a very interesting project to work on.”
She didn’t respond for an extra beat or two. He suddenly was aware that she was unhappy, or angry.
“I’m sure you understand that with the project coming to an end, we’ll have to wrap up your role here.”
“I sort of figured that out. I mean, Elise and Joe alluded to some future iterations and so on. And it would be fun. Is that not in the cards?”
“Elise and Joe are no longer connected with the Civilization Project,” she said. She projected calm, but he detected a cold anger.
“Wow, that’s some news,” he said, buying time as he tried to process what was going on.  “What happened?”
“Look, I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt here,” she said. “I know all about their alternate sim, with your empathy codes and all that. I’m going to assume that was their doing. I’ve had my doubts about Elise all along — there were some sketchy things in her past in Brazil. But I can’t have team members secretly undermining our grants.”
“What are you saying about what she did?” he asked, trying to sound uninformed and naive.
“Let’s just say that the code she had you write could potentially be used not just to simulate our society, but to simulate how our society could be overthrown. I believe Elise is secretly working for some kind of underground revolutionary group in Brazil.”
“Wow, she never said anything about that.”
“Yes, well, she underestimated both me and the Reagan Institute people. We have our own resources and that’s all I’m going to say about it. But I won’t say anything to MiniWorlds. I don’t think you had anything to do with it, and it wouldn’t be fair to you.”
He could tell she was lying. Words would be said, he would be under a cloud at MiniWorlds. How bad, he couldn’t tell. Was she lying about Elise, too? He found it hard to believe that he had never sensed any duplicity from Elise. And what about Joe — was he also unaware of Elise’s supposed other agenda? Roshi hadn’t said anything about him. Maybe he should reach out to Joe and sound him out.
The more he thought about it, the more anxious he became. He knew how hard it was to use anything on the Net without drawing attention. His Voice, his puter messages, the vids he watched — all that had been routinely scanned since the Slide by the government. In the aftermath, many governments had suggested that the Slide was the work of terrorists. By the time the truth came out that it was a botched weapons test by the U.S. government, many countries had already built elaborate autoscanning systems and few decommissioned them. He’d met people who claimed that they knew holes in them and ways around them, but he couldn’t trust that. He had to assume they were full of it, or deliberately trying to lure people into fake safe zones.
He took the subway to the end of the line and hailed a ride with his Voice. He gave the driver an address a few blocks from the last library in the western suburbs. He walked to it and sat down at a puter. Most of the other patrons were old and poor; they came here because they were homeless or couldn’t pay Net fees. Like them, he pulled up local news, read a few stories, and intermittently, started a search for Joe. He got lucky. 
Joe was involved with an AI group that had RoboSmart games. These were like the old-fashioned quiz shows that still lived in online vids — old shows like College Bowl and Jeopardy had cult followings. College students got together and watched them, trying to beat the contestants without looking every question up online. Joe’s group hosted events where three robots competed to answer the same kinds of questions. The results were sometimes hilarious, as the robots didn’t always correctly parse the kinds of questions an average school kid could understand. But they were getting smarter as programmers like Joe learned from their silly mistakes.
This weekend, there was just such an event in Boston. He’d go, and hope Joe was also there. He had to figure this out quick, before events got the better of him.

May 26, 2049
Diver gazed out over endless sea, the wind whipping her feathered crest.
“Once our ancestors could cross that ocean with no tech at all,” Far Flier said. “Now, we wouldn’t get far at all with these engineered flight suits.”
“Funny how the ocean is now harder for us to cross than space itself,” Diver said. “Now that we all live on this continent, we have little reason to go to the other continents. And there’s machines to take us there when we do. Still, it’s been years since I soared over open water. Do you want to glide for awhile?”
“I have a better idea. Well, at least a different one. Can you swim?”
“Can you?”
“Yes, centuries ago I visited Water Eye for some Guardian business. They have small floating platforms for visitors, but after awhile I felt stupid asking them to come to the edge of the platform every time we wanted to meet. Our flight suits have a fail-safe mode for water, did you know that?”
“No, I didn’t.”
“Well, if you go too deep they warn you. If they detect that you’re hurt or unconscious, they slowly move you to the surface. This is in case you fall into the water flying through the canyons. But it will work in the ocean, too. So I decided I would see how our ancestors might have felt, going underwater to look for schools of fish.”
“That must have made Adno’s people feel good,” she said, remembering that Adno’s people had little taste for the ironic.
“Indeed. Fortunately, we were strongly entangled and they understood I meant them no harm. They may not be the most subtle species among the Guardians, but they don’t confuse us with the flying fish of their world that prey on them. Anyway, after our long flight here, I think you’ll love the wonderful cooling feel of the water.”
They dove off of the edge of the cliff, circling down against thermals rising from the water. They were only 20 meters from the water now. The wind whipping the water would drown out any conversation, but Far Flier’s thoughts reached her just fine.
“Watch what I do and follow me,” he thought. And he headed straight down into the water, a plume shooting up almost to her as the water closed around her feet. 
She tucked her wings in and stretched her feet to the sky. The water came fast and pushed her face back into her head, just for a second, and then she was wet and cool and weightless in a world of deep bluish green. She sensed Far Flier off to her right and watched how he used his limbs to navigate in the water. She turned to follow him down a few meters. Strange spongey rock towers  rose from the bottom, and all manner of small marine creatures swam around and through the holes in the towers. Far Flier took them closer. The water had currents like the air,  only they were thick and viscous to move through. Everything slowed down. The towers were alive, she could feel their energy. Many schools of fish circled the towers, occasionally passing through each other as if some quantum field kept them from touching. Now and then, the light from above lit up the fish. She was enchanted.
“Come,” Far Flier’s thoughts said. “Our enhancements will only allow us to stay under for a short time.”
He kicked upward toward the surface, his wings clearing the water and immediately grabbing the air for a lift as his enhanced legs thrust free of the water. She followed suit and amazingly, was airborne again. She let the rising currents take her back to the cliff.
“Wow, why have I waited 400 years to do that?” she said. “That was amazing. A whole other world under our beaks.”
 “Well, I’m glad you suggested this little picnic. Have some rainbow fish.” He passed her a container with several of the small fish, seasoned with herbs. “My life recently has been quite turbulent. Nice to be out here with just you, so quiet and peaceful.”
“I sensed that you had something on your mind,” she said. “What’s going on?”
“I don’t know where to start. I had wanted to talk to you about one thing, and then something else happened and now I’m very conflicted.”
“Maybe I can help sort it out. What was it you originally wanted to talk about?”
 &quot;It may seem odd, after I tell you the second. But anyway, do you know how long I have been a Guardian?&quot;
&quot;Since before I became an ambassador, but no, I don’t know how long.”
&quot;It's been more than eleven centuries.&quot;
Ah, now she understood. &quot;So you will transform soon?&quot;
&quot;In a year or two, I will change to a female.&quot;
&quot;And you’re worried that we cannot be lovers then?&quot;
&quot;Who knows? Our hearts will go whichever way they want. Either way, we will be friends. After our recent conflict, I realized how rare it is to find someone who both loves you and challenges you. And how much I cherish that.”
“And I, as well. In both directions — love and challenge. I think you’ll be a wonderful girlfriend for me, and not my first. So you can rest easy on that score.”
“Good to know. The point is, it has been a long time since I fathered a child. It would mean a great deal to me if you would join with me for that, before I change. It will be a long time into the future before I can mother my own child, and I don’t want to wait that long to be a parent again. I’m feeling the need to leave more behind than just memories.&quot;
In only her fourth century, she had never thought much about birthing a child. Far Flier was her first lover who had even passed into parent status.
“Wow. My first reaction is, frankly, awe. None of my childhood friends have reproduced. I haven’t had to think about it much.”
“And you may not want to when I tell you the rest.”
He recounted Hanikori’s ultimatum.
“Far Flier, I’m so sorry that it’s come to this. How can I help?”
“Help? I don’t think you can, as far as stopping him. He has won, for now. I will have to find a way to step down, and make it look like I’m just stepping aside for a time. I will remain a Guardian, but a quiet one, while I watch and wait. Hanikori, he is another story. I am beginning to believe he is a rare bird.”
“How so?”
“Of course, you can’t repeat this for now. But I am more convinced than ever that he is insane, or at the least, mentally unbalanced.”
“How can that be? We were all raised to believe that mental illness had been eliminated thousands of years ago. That our entanglements and our enhancements and all of our technology make it impossible for our minds to go so far out of balance as to be what you say.”
“I don’t know how it can be. But the facts are there and disturbing. His bizarre record on Earth, where most of his prized contacts turned out to be psycopathic dictators like Kim Jong Il — you should read up on him and you’ll understand what I mean. His current project. His penchant for dramatic confrontations. More and more, I’ve come to believe one hypothesis explains them all.”
“So you’ve discovered the true nature of his current project?”
“Not completely. But at least one piece of it I know: he wants to abstract consciousness from the body.”
“Don’t we do that now, when we travel through the wormhole interface?”
“No, not at all. You project thoughts and feelings from your consciousness, but it stays firmly rooted in your body. Imagine if your mind was literally elsewhere.”
“What would be the point?”
“I don’t know. But it seems insane, doesn’t it? To split the mind and body that way?’
“Yes, I agree. And deeply troubling. How can you give the Guardian leadership over to him if that’s true?”
“I’ve thought long and hard about this. We’re not used to dishonest conflict, to sneak attacks. But that’s what Hanikori is orchestrating, I’m sure. And at some point, the Guardians who still hold to our original mission must launch a sneak counter attack. Which means feigning surrender in order to eventually defeat him and his allies, whoever they are.”
“You are so brave, Far Flier. In 10,000 years, no one has had to do this.”
“Sadly, in the nearly billion years since Na’wra’s Explorers discovered other intelligent life and founded the Guardians, situations like this have occurred from time to time, even if not on our world. Part of my initiation as head of the council was to read the ancient archives and to learn how prior leaders met these sorts of challenges. So, what you call bravery is just what I have prepared for quietly for centuries.”
“Call it what you like, it will require courage.”
“And I fear, companionship. When I imagine what lies ahead, you are always in the picture.”
“You know I have deep feelings for you, Far Flier. I want to say yes to what you are suggesting, even if I don’t know exactly what it means.”
“It means that we would lead a dual life for decades, perhaps centuries. The life people will see is that of two minor Guardian officials, not very important people, going about their work, perhaps raising a child. The life only a few will know is being part of a shadow Guardian organization that monitors and ultimately resists whatever Hanikori is planning.”
“I don’t think I should answer this now. This is an occasion to enter alakh, to go deep inside and know my mind as fully as I can. When I emerge from it, you will know my mind.”
“That is all that I can ask now, that you know your mind and be true to it and share it with me.”</Text>

He felt Lina tickling his mind.
“Raefe, the most wonderful thing has happened.”
“Glad someone’s having a good time.”
“Your sim is not going well?”
“You know it. And I’m just stuck. I’d love some good news — what’s up with you?”
“Remember Alton?”
“Sure.”
“Well, after you left, he and the Citizens did reach an agreement of sorts. The Citizens have a high council of sorts, although it’s pretty informal. They were very worried about allying with an army, as I predicted. Anyway, they decided to try a small joint project. So last September, 100 people from each group went off together, on their own, and built a small village. The test was to see if their economic system and our social system could work together and be something more than either.”
“What is their economic system? He started to tell us but I never got what he meant by it.”
“It’s about combining healing the environment with providing food and shelter. In Nigeria, the planted thousands, maybe millions, of mangrove trees to filter the chemical pollutants from the waters around Lagos. Big oil and chemical refineries had made them unusable.”
“Cool, but not that original,” he said. 
“But here’s where it gets innovative. They harvest the parts of the mangroves that actually absorb the pollutants. The plants grow back, and it actually helps them live longer to be pruned like that. They’ve developed simple processes — crushing, burning, that sort of thing — to separate the pollutants from the plant. They purify them through a variety of simple flotation filters, and they’re left with a menu of stuff. Heavy metals, sulfur, phosphorous, organics. Some they use internally to make construction materials. Others they barter to get stuff they need.”
“Cool and original — even better. They interact with global capitalism, but they are really outside the system of debt and currency. And they were doing that sort of thing with the Citizens?”
“Yes, just different pollution problems. It was working well. Fatima was one of the people, and last week, Edna asked me to visit and see how she was doing. Something amazing happened.”
“What? You’re killing me with suspense here.”
“Fatima’s cousin Addisu  tried in his way, to entangle with the other people, but he’s too new at it. But when I arrived, he asked me to help and something completely unexpected happened. Addisu couldn’t sense how close everyone was, but I felt it immediately. I tried reaching out to some individuals who seemed to have the strongest signals, but they were all strong. Raefe, we did it — we created the waveform that Diver talks about. All of a sudden, we could all sense each other, all 201 of us.”
“Holy shit. What was it like?”
“Was? Is! It is fantastic. Let me bring you into it!”
“How?”
“Just relax. You feel that?”
And just like that, as if he was looking out his window at 200 people in a park, he could feel each of their minds. It was a warm feeling, what his grandmother used to call a group hug. But it was complex and shaded. He could get lost in it.
“Yes, there’s so much to explore,” Lina said. “This is how life could be, so rich.”
“I wish I was there,” he said.
“But you are,” she answered. “You are here, just not in the old way.”
He didn’t know what to think. Just then he felt Alton’s mind.
“We meet again,” Alton said.
“I never imagined it would be like this,” Raefe said.
“Yet you seem unhappy,” Alton said.
“No, I’m very happy. But when Lina connected, I was very frustrated. I’ve been trying to understand what you all are doing on a bigger scale, working out how we can understand how this will change things.”
“Lina told me about your project,” Alton said. “It sounds super cool. Can we help?”
“Maybe,” Raefe said. “Things have taken an odd turn, though.”
He filled Lina and Alton in on what had happened with Elise and Roshi.
“So I don’t know what’s going on, and it’s good we’re communicating this way, because honestly, I’m in over my head here. The Reagan Institute, Roshi, these people are in another league. I want to try and find Joe Nguyen, see what I can learn from him. Fortunately, I kept a copy of the code, but it’s not complete and I have no hardware it can run on. If I put it in the cloud, they’ll find it if they want to look hard enough.”
“You should come here,” Lina said. “I think you’re in danger there.”
“You might be right,” he said. “But I think this code could help us and I need to find out what happened. I think Joe’s cool.”
“But you don’t know, right?” she said.
“No, but I have to find out.”
“Let NVA help. They have contacts in America. They can track him down over time. If he’s cool, he’ll still be there. If he’s some kind of government dude or corpo, he’ll have moved on to another situation. We need you.”
“I’m telling you, I sat with those two for weeks and I never felt anything wrong from either of them. I trust them. And I need to know what we’re up against.”
“What if there was someone like you,” Alton asked, “but he was not a good person? Worked for the highest bidder, or worse yet, was a true believer in the corpo way?”
“Have you ever met someone like that?”
“No, but we’re not all that common, us empaths.”
“I’m going to err on the side of trust and track him down.”
He could feel their sadness and frustration with him.
“OK, but we’re going to make arrangements for you to get here quickly if you have to,” Lina said. “We want to err on the side of trust, too, but I think maybe we know how slim that margin of error is better than you. And how disastrous the consequences could be.”
It was his turn to be angry and frustrated that they couldn’t see what he saw.
“Wow, empathy doesn’t solve everything, eh?” Raefe thought, almost exactly at the same instant Lina did.

            <Text>Clearing her mind
July 14, 2049
After her swim with Far Flier, Diver had spent several weeks buried in work. She had wanted to say yes to him on the spot, but mistrusted herself and needed time to think. The conflict with Hanikori was ominous and strange. All the same, she had spent considerable hours monitoring Raefe and Lina a Dadaab, and things there were going better than she had expected.
The Guardians had long debated how conscious entanglement had arisen through evolution. After all, Na’Wra had no one to teach her. Nothing in her culture prepared her for it, or even considered it possible. Many scholars had concluded that the survival pressures of extended war had triggered epigenetic changes in her. These same changes enabled her to make them permanent and to instruct her progeny in how to trigger them and keep them from dissolving. Lina’s experiences at Dadaab lent credence to that theory. The emergence of Fatima and Edna as naive entanglers was living proof that certain kinds of stresses could trigger this evolution. Still, the details were murky.
All very interesting if her job was as a researcher, but she was a Guardian ambassador. Most exciting was the convergence of Raefe and Lina’s abilities with the social awareness of Citizens of Nowhere and the alternate economic system of the New Voodo Army. This was the first time in Earth’s history that the prototypical elements had come together that usually helped civilizations escape the Optimization phase and grow into a more sustainable culture. The Guardian archives were full of such flowerings that had failed. But of the 20 civilizations now in the Guardians, all but one had followed this sort of path. And now she would have to hope that Adno could help protect and nurture it.
She would give Far Flier her answer in a few days, but first, she needed to be sure. It was time for alakh, the thinking sleep. She arranged her room for maximum quiet. She removed herself from all entanglements. Finally she disconnected her enhancements from all communications. She was alone with her thoughts.
She watched the movie of her life as if it were someone else. For more than the last 100 years, she had been the bright female that everyone liked. She was the person who had energy and promise. But her accomplishments were minor. Despite what Far Flier said, she was sure that she would never join the Guardian Council, much less lead it as he had. She was not a pathbreaker.
And yet she realized now that she couldn’t know that. She didn’t know what the future would bring, with or without Far Flier, or the Guardian Council. She couldn’t pretend that her future lay only in that context. It was time to inventory just what she had done.
She had engaged with Raefe and now in only a year or so, had brought him very far down the road to being a significant change agent. She had helped him through his trials with separation, and now he and Lina were a force to be reckoned with. No one had recruited a new civilization to the Guardians in centuries and now she was close to doing just that.
The point wasn’t that she had accomplished this, but that she had surprised herself with her strength, perseverance and skill. These would be her pillars, no matter what she undertook. And she realized that Far Flier had said these things to her many ways, many times. And now she knew that he was not just acting the teacher, but also the pupil. He needed her.
Not just him. If what he had said was right, the Guardians needed her. Although he was only in his late middle years and not yet old, he had lost some of his hope and strength. Hanikori was cunning and she knew he had allies planted in many places. Far Flier had held Hanikori off, but it was only a matter of time before he retreated to a place from which he would no longer be able to stop Hanikori in whatever it was he was doing. And she was sure that would not be good.
Connection, people, life — these were fundamental things she would fight for. These were the things that any future she wanted to be a part of would have to built on. The swirling thoughts in her head had spiraled down to this one clear point. She knew she should emerge from alakh now and walk that path.
It was nearly midnight, but she reached out to Far Flier. As he made his way to her room, she let him feel her alakh. She opened the door for him.
“We will make a child, and we will make a new Guardians,” she said. “I will do this with you.”
She took him wordlessly to her bed. After they had made love, Far Flier guided her in coupling to begin the creation process. In the next few weeks, he would nurture the egg he had fertilized and received from her. His body, with its enhanced nano gene repair tech, would remove any mistakes, correct any serious diseases, build an energy transfer layer around it and wrap it in a protective gel.
When it was done, he would return to her, and they would perform the ancient ritual of transferring the embryo to her. Then her body would take over, and grow it until it was ready to be born. The time spent in both their bodies would allow the baby to immediately join their wave function, and its connection with them would pave its entrance into the larger community.
She knew that there would be pain and discomfort involved for both of them. Long ago, her species had tried to abolish all that by raising children outside the body. They learned the hard way that evolution had embedded in them the physicality of creation and birth. Both for the parents and the child, there were so many unforeseen and undesirable consequences to losing that experience. So they had contented themselves with merely making it safe.
In the early morning hours, they smiled and sang the first songs of new parents-to-be together. To feel such a chorus for the first time was an experience worth a little discomfort.</Text>

Water Eye
July 20, 2049
The waters were cold today. Somewhere, a deep river had begun to wind its way toward the surface, bringing with it trillions of tiny creatures that lived off of material shed by the redfish that lived above, in the warmer waters. Now those redfish would feast on the tiny creatures, growing and shedding old cells that would then feed more tiny creatures in the deep. Larger creatures would prey on the enlarged redfish schools, and Adno’s school would feed on them. Adno could feel the deep contentment of the whole school, their place in this cycle firm and known.
“Many thanks to all of you for helping me with the humans,” she broadcast. She felt their pleasure that the project had been successful.
“It has been many years since I touched the minds of land dwellers,” Arman said. “So many odd sensations. Like being tickled on the belly by a school of little gold speckled min. Quite amusing.”
“Ancient one, so happy to please,” Adno responded. “Did we feel the deepness of it, too? When Lina and Fatima and Alton and their friends connected through us, did we feel the life-changing joy of it?”
The school hummed with pleasant memories. Mixed in, rude jokes began to emerge about that old fart, Tanoch, who had doubted Adno. Did he not understand that she had their strength behind her, that these birds and beasts who lived in ones and twos on the land could sing melodies, but not the symphonies that swelled their waters?
“No, he doesn’t understand. And I’m not ready to let him know. The land dwellers don’t know how to combine so many melodies in a harmonious way. They won’t  understand how we can join as TheManyLargeLoudBlueSchool and still each be free as our own minds. They can only conceive that someone or something forces us to chorus. They have not travelled from birth in our great schools, wandering the vast currents together, taking turns looking for danger, steering, exploring. They are enhanced now, each of them their own school of sensors when it comes to senses. So they will never swim this current with us.”
“Will you tell Tanoch about the humans?” Smi asked. “At least he should know your successes.”
“Later,” she said. “Right now I must learn more about why he has put us in charge of the humans and pushed Diver out. Something wrong is going on.”
“How can we help?” Smi replied. “Diver is one of our favorite land dwellers.”
She explained how she would be able to access the archives of the wormhole interface and get access to the last ten years of data. With the thousands of minds in the school, they would be able to find any suspicious activities within a couple of days of paying attention to it in the back of their minds.
“Your timing is good,” Asmo replied. “The skies will be dark these next nights. We will relax, leave our hunting until the moon returns. We can mine your data easily.”
Later, she swam to the wormhole interface that had been modified for underwater use and installed on Water Eye long ago. But Adno had learned to do something her ancestors had not even thought of. Just as she was able to entangle with many others in the TheManyLargeLoudSchool, she could entangle as multiple threads through the interface. She created hundreds of connections, making short work of copying the archives. Even as she felt it enter her mind, she flowed streams of it to her schoolmates.
It was Smi who found the evidence.
“Before you were even an egg, Tanoch was an ambassador to the Yunx. Do you know of them?” he asked.
“No, not really. They became extinct, right?” Adno replied.
“Yes, Tanoch could not divert them from their own destruction. But he also had a secret about the Yunx and Hanikori discovered it.”
“A secret? What could that be?” she asked.
“It is like squid ink in the water now. But he was unusually active in entangling with a certain Yunx, MunzKizzFron, in the days before the Yunx blew themselves into oblivion.”
“MunzKizzFron?” Tra piped up. “I have records of MunzFizzFron being transferred to a new timeline at least seven times.”
“What about other empaths on Yunx? Were there any other transfers?” Adno wondered.
“No one more than once, just MunzKizzFron,” Tra said.
No one else in the school had any data to contradict that.
“Ah, I think I know what happened,” Adno said. “You all see it now, don’t you?”
The school murmured in a low giggle. Poor Tanoch!
She waited for a few days, letting her mind plot the course through these new waters. On the third night of the new moon, she found Tanoch through the wormhole interface.
“Tanoch, I swim the waters looking for the guidance you have left for me, but I cannot find it.”
“Guidance? What are you on about?”
“The currents bring news of big changes in the Council. How is a lone swimmer such as myself to know which currents to join?”
“The Council is none of your business. I’ve told you before. Just keep an eye on Raefe and Lina.”
“I have, Tanoch. It is possible that Raefe is in danger again.”
“Really? Even after we had transferred him to this new timeline?”
“Yes, maybe. Certain other humans may be plotting to kill him.”
“Oh, what crazy theory are you on to now, Adno? Who would want to kill him?”
“People who understand his potential.”
“What humans understand that, besides his partner? What’s her name?”
“Lina. No, not her. And I said ‘people,’ not ‘humans.’ That enlarges the pool.”
“What are you suggesting? That a Guardian is involved?”
“No, but could it be someone from one of our worlds, but not a Guardian?”
“Ridiculous!”
“All the same, can you ask Timelines for advice, as a backup measure?”
“Not a chance! We can’t be shuttling him from timeline to timeline every few months.”
“Oh, forgive me then. Rookie mistake. I thought perhaps Raefe might be in the same sort of jam as MuzzKizzFron.”
Even through the wormhole, she could feel a surge of fear and embarrassment from Tanoch. She counted to three before he began to answer her.
“Muzz? Why do you mention him?”
“As your mentee, I study your work. I noticed that you had him transferred seven times during your work with Yunx. I assumed he was a critical player in their world, much as Raefe is on Earth.”
“Muzz is nothing you need concern yourself with.”
Half the school was listening in, amplifying his emotions, filtering out noise. At that resolution, she could see a complex of emotions trying to hide from her. Ah, now it was clear — her suspicions had been correct.
“No, you are right. Your love life is really not my business. But I am still confused about Guardian policy. If it is possible for you to transfer your lover seven times, why is it not possible for me to transfer Raefe twice in the interests of helping Earth? And do I have to learn how to use the Timeline interface myself, or is there someone who helped you who will help me?”
His fear was strong now.
“What do you want?”
“I want to know why you took my mentor, Diver, off of her assignment to monitor Earth and put me, only a trainee, in charge. I had thought perhaps you would become my mentor, but you give me no help. All in all, I am tempted to believe you want me to fail, and therefore, you want Raefe and Lina and the rest to fail. Is that true? Or shall I make a special appeal to the Council to discuss this openly?”
“I don’t think that will be as helpful as you think.”
“You think I am a stupid fish who doesn’t understand what happens on land. But I have found my way across great oceans, and I will find my way through this, too. Just tell me what you know.”
“Alright, alright. But you don’t bring it to the Council — agreed? That would work out badly, trust me.”
“I can accept that for now.”
“Certain people on the Council want your project to fail. They pressured me to put you on it. My misadventures of the heart with Munzz gave them leverage to insist.”
“But maybe they have other ways to help Earth fail, no? After all, even without me or the Guardians, Raefe and Lina might succeed.”
“They don’t tell me, but I fear you are right. I’ve picked up some whispers that might mean that they will harm them. Or at least him.”
“Whispers? What exactly did these whispers say and who was whispering?”
“I can’t tell you who. But I’ll tell you what, and then you must leave this subject. This conversation itself is dangerous. Perhaps these same people have found ways to listen to our waveform without us knowing.”
Adno had asked Tra to monitor the waveform for ghosts. He signalled here that he had found nothing.
“I think we are safe for now — I have taken precautions. So what is it you may have heard?”
“Raefe could be killed any day now. I’m not positive, but there’s always been that possibility, and I think it may be in motion now. And you should thank me for allowing you to return to Water Eye.”
“Thank you Tanoch. Your secret is safe with me. You should think about how you want to redeem yourself after a thousand years of service. You have made mistakes, but are you willing to work to overcome them?”
She felt him snarl.
“Well, give it some thought. Can I trust that our conversation will remain between us?”
“Yes, yes, don’t worry. I’m not eager to show that my students’ students are now more clever than me.”
He broke the waveform abruptly, leaving her swimming in tight circles, amped up and eager to strike back before it was too late.

Boston
August 6, 2049
Adno felt Raefe’s anxiety as he approached the RoboSmart match. She had promised Lina she would monitor the situation. Lina’s new friends, the New Voodo Army, also had contacts in Boston, and they had promised to show up. Adno had never entangled with them, just Alton, so she wasn’t sure if they were there yet.
She had learned that she could feel other empaths through Raefe, even if he wasn’t aware of them. She quieted her own mind, fully immersed in his. Around the edges, she could feel little spikes of emotion that he was receiving, but nothing significant so far. As he entered the club where the match was, she felt more noise. Ah but there was another mind, very close to him actually. She tried entangling with it and connected surprisingly easily. This one was no novice.
He thought she was someone else, another empath. She withdrew quickly, not wanting to reveal herself. Through Raefe, she could feel the empath connect to his friend, a woman. Jamal and Shawna were there names. Adno opened another thread to Alton, who confirmed that those were his people. All seemed well, then, and she started to relax and refocus on Raefe when she felt a jolt.
Raefe had seen Joe Nguyen across the room and was trying to catch his eye. But even Raefe could tell that Joe was himself entangled with someone. How could that be?  Raefe had never revealed that about himself to Joe, had never felt any such skills in him. Raefe was on high alert now, sensing that Joe was entangled with someone named Hank. Something about that sent chills up her spine.
She opened another thread with her school and asked them all to investigate who Hank was. Something told her it would be better if minds other than hers, minds not known to the Guardians, probed the situation. She turned her attention back to Raefe.

“Hey, didn’t expect to see you here!” Joe said.
“Well, you’re a hard man to find,” Raefe said. “What happened after the big RI meet? I tried to find you and Elise, and poof, you were both gone.”
“Yeah, that was a cluster fuck,” Joe said, looking uneasy. “You heard about Elise?”
“Roshi told me some stuff. Felt like not the whole story. What’s your take on it?”
“She used us, man. She had her own agenda.”
“What agenda?”
“I don’t know the whole story, and honestly, I don’t want to know. But she messed up near the end, I caught her copying all the code to some dead drop server in Brazil. She had all kind of reasons, but it was all bullshit.”
“Why would she do that?”
“I think she’s part of some anarchist group down there. They thought they could use this code to find weak spots in Brazilian society. Put pressure right on the fault lines and boom, there’s a big fissure opening up.”
“So why’d you pull out, too?”
“Honestly, she scared me. Started talking about armed this and armed that. I didn’t want to become a casualty of some guerilla campaign in Brazil.”
“You really think that was possible?”
“Hell yeah. You didn’t hear her. Some of that earnest, nicey Elise stuff — that was just a cover.”
Raefe let that sink in. Someone had been lying. And he had missed it. Elise? Joe? Someone else?
*****
“You’re going to want to feel this,” Tra said. “Join with us.”
Adno merged with Tra’s waveform. Instantly, she recognized a signature in the waveform he was secretly entangled with. It was Hanikori! And he was entangled with Joe Nguyen.
“Hey, Joe,” Hanikori said. “It’s Hank.”
“Dude, what’s up,” Joe replied. “I’m a little busy right now.”
“I can feel that you are with someone. Rafe Epstein-Miller, right?”
“Bingo. Can I connect later?”
“No, this will only take a minute. Keep engaged with him, keep nodding your head and making eye contact while he’s talking.”
“No problem.”
“Remember what we discussed about him?”
“Sure.”
“I think we’re at that point. He can’t leave here knowing what happened. Honestly, he really can’t leave here at all.”
Adno was stunned. Hanikori had established contact before with Joe Nguyen? They had discussed Raefe? What in the three suns and three planets was he up to?
“We’ve probed Joe’s memories lightly,” Tra said. “He and the one who calls himself Hank have been in contact for months.”
Joe was talking to Raefe again.
“Yeah, I can’t really help you on the code, man. She took it.”
“I really need that code. Do you know anyone who could put me in touch with her?”
Joe paused. Adno could feel him considering how to play this. It was an opportunity, Joe could see that. For what?
“Well, I found her one day talking to some sketchy characters outside the lab. When they left, one of them said they’d see her at the Dark Side of the Moon.”
“That’s a real place?” Raefe said. “I always thought that was a joke, the infamous hacker club, like something from a vid.”
“No, it’s real alright.”
“Can you tell me where it is?”
“I can, but you’d never get in. You have to know someone. I could get you in the door, though, and point out these dudes.”
Adno was stunned. She could feel under Joe’s conversation that he was thinking about where he’d stashed a gun, and where he could use it to kill Raefe on this supposed trip. He was in danger, right now.
“That’s cool. When could we go?”
“Can you meet me in the alley behind the club in 15? I’ve got to tie up a few loose ends, and then I’m free.”
Adno was shocked. Raefe had sensed none of this. Hanikori had obviously trained Joe well in evading entanglement. The head of the Guardian Council, with his own private operatives on Earth. How many of these did he have? She would have to investigate this in the future. For now, she had to help Raefe. She reached out to his mind.
“Adno, how nice to feel you. How can I help.”
“I have something to tell you and you must trust me. You have very little time and your life is in danger. Do you see a tall dark-skinned man standing with a short  lighter skinned woman in a corner to your left?”
“Yeah…What’s this about?”
“Joe is not your friend. He’s gone to fetch a gun that he hid in the men’s room. Those two people are Jamal and Shawna. They know who you are. Just tell them ‘Get me out of here, now.’ They’ll help. I have to go now — I’ll be in touch later.”
She let Tra see what he needed to do. She followed Raefe’s thoughts as he met Jamal and Shawna. Thankfully, they didn’t argue and whisked him out the door. Only seconds later, Joe came out of the men’s room and started toward the back door. He stopped, as if he was listening for something. Then he shrugged and turned around and walked out the front door. He got on a solar bike and left.
“It worked,” Tra said. “I was able to impersonate Hank enough to convince him that I’d changed my mind and he should just leave. He’s not experienced enough at entangling to see through it.”
She surfaced, arching upwards out of the water, exploding with all of her might as she leapt high above the water, then plunging back down, down, down until it was dark. She let the currents carry her, trying to calm herself. The only person she could think of who might understand this was Diver. She would have to risk reaching out to her.
*****
Raefe lay low in the back of the van, his face pressed against the back seat. Behind him, racks of baked bread hid the back door. If anyone opened it, they would have to remove the racks to find him. They had been driving to New York for hours. He wasn’t sure what the right thing to do was, but instinctively, he had decided to disentangle from everyone, to withdraw into his own mind, and not connect with anyone, even through speech. He was invisible back here, on the floor of the van, and he wanted to stay that way. Maybe Alton had been right — maybe there were bad empaths at work here.
He rolled over and over in his mind the thought that someone wanted to kill him. Someone thought his little science project was that important? No, that couldn’t be it. Someone thought his mind was that important. Because he was an empath? Or because he was an empath and had been a fugee in another life?
That felt closer to the truth. Someone knew that Lina had been right, that fugees were the future. And they didn’t want empaths meddling in that. They must know about Nowhere, and the NVA, and all of their clumsy attempts to bring people together. They must think that he and Lina would get it right eventually and that they would make things uncomfortable for someone. But who?
He’d figure that out, eventually. But for now, he would take the passport that Shawna had given him, and get on the plane to Lagos, where Alton’s people would find him, and bring him to Lina. They had half-joked that sometimes empathy wasn’t everything. And now he knew which half of that joke was true: a lone empath was vulnerable. Empathy would only carry the day if it was embraced by huge numbers of people. People who had each other’s backs, who could move bigger rocks out of the way than one person, who could extend their eyes and ears everywhere they needed to be.
In a context like that, a piece of software from the geniuses at MIT might be helpful. But it would never be a substitute for that loom of connection, that whole that would be greater than the sum of its parts that humanity needed to become.
He would become a Citizen of Nowhere and trust his fellow citizens to help find that way. No more pretending that he could work within the corpo world, a little off to the side, but part of the machinery. If he was in the machine, he could be crushed. Lina had seen the truth, that the old world was a death trap. From now on, he would travel on the margins, meeting the ones who no one cared about, seeing what they were doing to survive, what new ideas they had. He would help them build a new world, out on the edges, a world where people no longer thought only about themselves, but existed in a web of purpose and connection, of freedom to explore and probe and experiment. As the center shrunk with each catastrophe, the edges would pinch in, until they were strong enough to occupy the center. It would take years, but what choice did they have?

Traveller’s Perch
Adno continues her reconnaissance of Hanikori. She discovers that Tanoch was right. He is planning an accident that will kill Diver and FF. She tells them and about the spaceship that can bring them to her homeworld. She will join them there later, but they will be safe there. They agree but don’t want to steal it — they don’t want to be always on the run. Instead they announce they are retiring to have a baby and the volunteer to test pilot the ship to Water Eye to help Putnomo out. Hanikori grudgingly lets them go, hoping they’ll die enroute, since the technology is not that great. But Adno uses the school to troubleshoot and they secretely improve it so that they can make the journey safely.</Text>

Newcastle, Northern England
October 28, 2081
He had followed Claire and Ganesh after Silvia had taken them out of Tyneside. No one had fired at them since the first shot. But Raefe now felt the same fears that he had read in so many other war zone victims. He had been around fighting on and off in his years in Dadaab, but had never personally felt what it was to be like when someone was firing at you, trying to kill you. He remembered that Alton’s friends had rescued him from an attempt by Joe Nguyen, but no shots were fired then. That was as close as had come. How had he escaped injury or death this time? He suspected that the image of the shooter  aiming at him had occurred before the shot and resulted in him leaning away enough to miss the bullet.
“You’re mighty calm,” Claire said.
“Far from it. I’ve sensed this feeling in hundreds, maybe thousands, of people over the year. Not the same when you’re feeling it yourself.”
“Seeing yourself through a sniperscope?” Ganesh said, and Raefe knew he was asking from personal experience.
“Honestly, I feel like I’m wearing crosshairs on my forehead, like a new tattoo.”
Claire put her finger up in a “wait” gesture. She pulled a small device out of her pocket. It took Raefe a second to realize it was a very old Voice, before they made them to fit in your ear. She listened and nodded and listened and nodded for a few cycles.
“Right,” she said. “Plan C, just in case they’re on to Plan B. We’re to get you out of here, go south. You’re not safe in the North anymore. And after they find out you’ve been turning their supporters — that was brilliant, by the way — you’ll be even less safe. We have a few friends in the Guard — keeping their options open — and they say someone’s put Brian on to you. That wasn’t a random shooting back there. The Viking Squad, Brian’s best, have been sent out to find and kill you. Must have hit a nerve with your Everywhere theme song.” And she started singing “Wet Feet in the Sand” as if she was on a Net singing contest. Ganesh cracked up.
“Don’t let her kid you,” Ganesh said. “She’s shite with a gun, too lazy to work. We just keep her around for laughs.”
“Seriously, though,” she said. “We can get you to the border, but getting over it will be tough. Can your lot help? Any friends in the South?”
Raefe remembered a boy from Dadaab who fancied Nyssa when they were teenagers. He had gone off to the University of Lagos and been seduced by United Financial Services in London.
“Maybe. Give me a few minutes to think this through.”
He found Lina’s waveform.
“Things have gotten ugly up here. The Urban Gypsies are doing good work but government here is little more than organized thugs. Someone took a shot at me.”
“You’re alright?”
“Yeah, fine. They missed! I think I sensed someone aiming at me and leaned instinctually.”
 “The survival value of empathy, eh? But this is a new level for the opposition. The Northern Guard would never target you on their own, I don’t think. Which means someone, somewhere else, asked them to.”
“Agreed. Meanwhile, the Gypsies want to get me out of the Republic of Northern England, go to the south. Do we have any contacts there that can help? I can show my fake passport at the border and maybe get in, but I won’t last long down there just on that. You know what kind of identity tracking and surveillance the corpos have.”
“You’re thinking of Manfred?”
“Right! Couldn’t remember his name. Does she keep touch with him?”
“On and off. He’s married, midlevel in UFS, not happy she tells me.”
“Well, here’s a chance to act on that unhappiness. Talk to her and see what you guys can come up with. We’re probably headed out of town shortly.”
He turned to Ganesh and Claire.
“Let’s say we do have a contact and they can help us. We’re working on the details. What now?”
“Hang on,” Ganesh said. “You called your people? You have one of them fancy subvoc Voices implants?”
“G,” Claire said. “He does it with his mind. Empathy. That’s what Gordo’s been trying to tell us.”
“Thought it was just hype until now,” Ganesh said. “You can teach us that?”
“Some people can learn,” Raefe said. “My wife and I have a very strong bond. Most people can’t do that over distances like we can. Not yet. But with people you can see? Yes, if you have the inner abilities. And you both do — I could feel that you were able to sense those peoples’ feelings up in Tyneside. But we can always teach you to be more aware of what other people feel. Everyone can learn that.”
“Maybe we’ll play tricksies on the go,” Claire said. “Let’s get moving out of Newcastle at least.”

Newcastle, Northern England
October 28, 2081

“I’m glad you asked me here,” Raefe said to Gordon Brown, the leader of the Urban Gypsies. “After Dadaab, it’s important to strike while the iron’s hot and try to make some leaps.” He had been eager to follow the Everywhere declaration out in the world, to rally people around it. After 30 years, he felt that they were on the verge of something huge, and he wasn’t going to just sit in Dadaab and bask in the glory of it.
“Well, we’re thrilled you come. Lads, you all know Raefe Epstein Miller. We talked at the Everywhere meet, and I asked him to come and help us sort out our next steps. So now that he’s here, what do we think is holding us back?”
“Bloody Northern Guard, that’s what’s in the way” a young woman said. “Sorry, I’m Trina. We spent years here in the shadows, building up a whole way of life. We put pressure on the government, on the big corpos, we just had one demand: if you’re not using it, give it to the people. We took old buildings, old telecoms, anything they weren’t making a profit on, and we turned it into stuff people could use. No charge. We trained people to maintain it. And we were making a difference. Then the bleeding Northern Guard came along.”
“How much do you know about English history, Raefe?” Brown asked.
“King Arthur, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Elizabeth II, the Beatles, King Williams I, II and now III. And of course, George III. Never did too well in school when it came to history.” 
“Yeah, well, neither did most of us,” Gordo answered, laughing. “A long and bloody Shakespeare play, the lot of it. But here’s the quick course. About 100 years ago, the London government decided the North was a cancer on the United Kingdom. They cut us off, and if wasn’t for Liverpool Football Club and Newcastle Brown Ale, you’d never have heard from us up here again. But then In 2063, Brian McDornish, a local Manchester pol, got the idea that he was going to be a big hero. Northern England for the Northerners! Blew up a few London bank branches and so on.”
“C’mon, Gordo, he did more than that,” a dark-skinned man in his forties said. “Raefe, I’m Ganesh. That there is Mikey, me brother. We were with McDornish in the early days. Everyone in our block was. Northern pride! Yeah, he had the Hindus and the Jordies and whoever else singing song, instead of trashing pubs every night.”
“Well, it’s true,” Gordo said. “But it turned to shite fast enough. Two things happened: Southern England was taken over 100% by the corpos and they drew a line from the Wash down through Nottingham over to the Atlantic and said, everyone north of there, you’re on you’re own, you poor bastards. Just like that, we were Brexited from the United Kingdom. And then McDornish, he saw himself bringing a new Saxon order to the North. He declared the Republic of Northern England with himself as chieftain. England for the English and all that. That was back in 2073.”
“And now?” Raefe asked. “He wants the Gypsies to pay tribute? To disband?”
“To fockin’ die, that’s what he wants. Sorry, Irish Liam here. If you’re not his crew, he’s got no use for ya.”
“Hey, I’m Claire. To show you what Liam means,” a black-skinned woman in her thirties said in a thick Scots accent, “Last fall the Newcastle Shipping Company decomissioned a cargotainer ship. Used to go to Rotterdam to unload British farm stuff, pick up cars and such from Europe. Now Rotterdam’s on an island, they’re not the big ship to train to truck place they once was. Anyway, the ship was old, but huge and basically sound. The Gypsies got the idea that is could be housing for 1,000 people. McDornish insisted we pay rent for the docking space. It wasn’t even a public dock — the shipping company owned it but didn’t want it no more. Said we could have it for 30 years, free, just for taking it off its hands.”
“We told McDornish to stuff it,” Gordo said. “A week later, there was an explosion on the ship and it sunk. No one was onboard, thankfully.”
“Ganesh, you said you used to be with McDornish’s crowd. Why not still?”
“Me and my  Mikey, we were street kids in Little Mumbai in ‘64. McDornish recruited us to be soldiers for him. Filled our heads with all this nonsense about being real Brits, not like those Muslim bastards. Me and Mikey and our mates — we weren’t even against the Muslims. Played football with ‘em, some of us had Muslim girlfriends. But he made it seem like real Northerners, they wouldn’t stand for them, so get with it.”
“So that led to Court Street Community Center,” Mikey said. “I mean, the whole thing was daft — like some kids playing vids after school were a threat to the nation. I watched those white boys cheering while the place burned, those Muslim kids trapped inside. I felt in my heart they would  do the same for some other brown boys like me and Ganesh when it suited them. All that talk of how we could be real Northerners, like we weren’t already. Born and bred, is me and Ganesh.”
Raefe could feel the anger and tension in the room. How many rooms had he sat in like this the last 30 years? The frustration of the dispossessed was the same everywhere.
“Gordo, how can we make a dent in this?” Raefe asked. “Where can we find a crack between McDornish and his followers, and widen it into a crevice? What about these people who would have lived on that ship? Aren’t they mad about that?”
“Yeah, some are,” Gordo conceded. “Even some of his Jordie followers, old Saxon stock. There’s a bunch Tyneside, they were washed out by a storm surge and they’re basically homeless, living in the rubble.”
“Can we get down there for a chat? You all know I’m not talking about a fight. I’m talking about empathy, understanding what’s really in their hearts, and their heads, and maybe even them seeing that with us. Gordo told me you all have had some training in that, but not really a chance to put it to the test. This might be the time, eh, to see what’s really in their heads?” 
“Don’t know as I want to,” said Claire. “Bloody scary what’s in some of their heads.”
Raefe smiled to himself. They were new at this. Blood scary indeed. He remembered the first time he had felt someone else’s feelings. It was supremely odd, yet there was also a sense of familiarity. You thought, oh my, no one else thinks like me. But eventually you found the greater truth: our feelings are unique in the same way as our appearance. No two people look identical, but plenty of people resemble each other. Like one of those police sketch kits — you could make up almost anyone’s face by assembling a handful of bits from a few dozen choices. Feelings were the same way, if a bit more expansive and complex.
He had read a 20th century novel that had a scene where a child draws a picture. This took place before puters, and the girl had to use a piece of paper instead. And she didn’t have a light pen with a color wheel. Apparently back then they gave little children pen-shaped pieces of colored wax. They would come in sets. This little girl had a set with 12 different colors so she couldn’t draw all the flowers in the garden properly. She wanted the box with 88 colors. With 88 colors she could draw most anything and it would look real.
He had found that most people had about 100 emotions, but even then, they were related in groups. But the difference between any two people was not just which color and how strong each  was, but how one could amplify another, or tamp another down, or, well, even after all these years, he hadn’t really figured it all out. Everything affected everything, that he knew — they were all woven together, more like a tapestry than a drawing. Or maybe more like an electronic circuit, each component affecting the others in nonlinear ways.
Nonetheless, he had become fluent in the nuance of human emotions, and to the extent that the heart and the head were aligned, it helped him greatly to understand what other people were thinking. And so he had been able to understand how his own actions could change other people’s thoughts and feelings, and that had made him more confident in his ability to communicate. And he knew this would happen to all of them, in time. Right now, though, they were doing well to be at the 12-crayon stage.
“I know, that’s our first reaction,” Raefe said. “And maybe it is scary, but unless you start to understand what makes them tick, your choices are to ignore them or kill them. Both have unpleasant consequences.”
“Well, at least killing them is effective,” Irish Liam said. 
“Is it?” Raefe responded. “Because they have mothers and brothers and children, and they’ll grow up to hate you. Surely, you’ve seen that already.”
“Aye,” Gordo said. “Can’t argue with that. Half of us are here because of what they did to our families in the past. Let’s take a pass on revenge, Liam. That dish is always on offer. Let’s go down Tyneside tomorrow and talk to my wife’s cousins. They would have gotten space on the boat, too, so that’s something to talk with them about. They’re not keen on me, but they’ll not kill us for fear of Janet. ” 
That got a big laugh.
“So let’s do something new,” Raefe said. “We’ll chat, but if give you a glance and pull on my ear like this, it means I’m going to do what you’ve been learning about. I’m going to try and create a connection between all of us in the room, all of our emotions. If they start to freak, I’ll handle it. But are you game?”
The nodded mutely, not sure what they were getting themselves into but willing to try. They left early the next day, hoping to pass across the line into McDornish territory before most of his foot soldiers had slept off their pub night. Still, there were some about.
“You see the Guards over on the east side of that big building?” asked Gordon Brown, the Gypsies’ leader.  “They’re hardcore. Some of the others are just wankers.”
Raefe looked, but he had already felt the harsh glare of violent energy coming from the small groups Gordo was pointing to. How many times in the last 30 years had he witnessed a band of desperate armed people filled with that exact feeling? Some, like the Gypsies around him, gave off a more complex set of emotions: hope that by fighting they could end fighting, longing to wake up without the feeling of threat all around them. 
But many, like these die hards from the Northern Guard, had drunk long and hard the cocktail of violence and power that seemed to be the unofficial drink of every dissolving society. It was all too easy to put a gun in someone’s hands and all too easy for armed bands to believe that guns inoculated them from the end of the world as they knew it. By the time they found out they were no more effective than the idols of the ancients, it would be too late.
They walked in the shadows of abandoned buildings down a long avenue going downhill toward the Tyne. Downhill toward the water had been the worst address in many places since the glaciers had started falling into the sea, and this was no exception. The buildings had been flooded multiple times, although now they were dry. Toward the end of the avenue, there was a small square, with apartments all around it. The first floors were empty. Gordo took Raefe and Claire and Ganesh up the stairs. Raefe could feel eyes from all corners, wisps of contempt and fear but also inner conflict. Some people wanted to like them, he could feel that, except for having been told not to.
The stair opened up to a little landing, and off the landing, a neat room about 4 meters square. A pale white woman in her late 20s stood in the doorway.
“Gordon Brown,” she said. “Janet said you’d be here. With friends. Come in.” She waved them in with her hand.
Gordo introduced her as Margaret, Janet’s sister. Margaret’s husband, Sean, was there. And a variety of neighbors: Philip, Ron, Arun, Silvia, and Ashley. They all sat on folding chairs, balancing tea cups, making small talk.
“Janet says you want to talk to us about burying the hatchet,” Sean said, moving them past the pleasantries. “You wanting us to put in a word with the Guard for you?”
Raefe could feel that wasn’t totally sincere, but he wasn’t sure about what. It felt like they were being tested. What was the bottom line here, Sean wanted to know. Were they here to surrender?
“With the Guard, maybe, yeah,” Gordo said. Raefe could feel he didn’t mean it, but had decided to defer that issue. “But mostly, we’re thinking, hey, it’s a shite life right now and we’re all in it. Hard enough to find kip and keep dry. What are we fighting about?”
“McDornish says you’re not for the North. Maybe you’re for the South.” Raefe could feel Sean was calm, a bit proud, a bit stubborn.
“Sorry, could I just ask? I’m new here,” Raefe said. “It’s really me that wanted to meet with you all. I know Gordo from the Gypsies and all that. But when you say ‘for the North,’ what’s that mean to you?”
“You know, build up the North,” Silvia said. She had the look they got up here in the North when they passed their mid 20s, a deepness under the eyes, a permanent frown starting to set in the eyebrows. “We’ve had centuries of neglect up here. Then the South basically threw us out. So now we’re on our own. All for one, and such.”
 “Well, some of my friends heard about the ship that the Urban Gypsies were fitting up for people to live in,” Raefe said. “But now I hear it was blown up. What was that about?”
He had played dumb on who blew it up. He wanted to give them space to tell their own version. If nothing else, he was curious what they had been told.
“Don’t you know?” Margaret asked. Raefe felt it more as “how dumb are you?”
“We hear different things,” Gordo said. “What do you think happened?”
“Your lot blew it up,” Ron said. “Didn’t want to pay your taxes. And you want to blame it on Brian, make him look bad.”
He said it without rancor, but behind the voice Raefe could feel that Ron was McDornish’s man in this group. He had the Northern cross tattooed on the back of his neck, a blending of the Celtic cross and the Nazi Iron Cross. It was the Northern Guard’s emblem, but before them, it had been a popular local symbol going back to the days of NeoSkinheads. How long had he had it? Raefe couldn’t tell. He could feel the Gypsies bristle at his display of loyalty. Gordo’s band was struggling to control themselves.
“Well, I can tell you we didn’t, Ron,” Gordo said. “On my children’s lives.”
Raefe could feel Ron weighing whether to call Gordo a liar, and Gordo cocked like a pistol if he did.
“See, here’s the thing I came here to try and understand,” Raefe said. “A thousand people could have gotten out of the flood zone, gotten a decent bed to live in, sleep without worrying. How could either side here think that paying a tax, or not paying a tax, or getting credit or not getting credit, or any such bullshit, was more important than that?”
Ron had clammed up. He was angry, but words weren’t his battlefield.
“I can see that you’re not from around here,” Silvia said. “Or you’d know that who’s to blame is always what people here care most about.” 
“Because mostly, things go ass up here and somebody is always to blame, right,” Raefe said. “Somebody except the people who created the mess in the first place.”
“You sure you’re not from here?” Silvia said, laughing.
“I’m from a hundred heres,” Raefe said, smiling. “You’d be surprised how not unusual this place is.”
“Never been nowhere else,” Silvia said. Raefe could feel she was reasserting her privilege as a local. Ron looked bored, said he was going out for a smoke.
“Hey, we’ve not met,” Claire said. “I’m Claire. I’ll save you the trouble: born in Scotland, lived here since ‘73. We all have our list of those to blame. We all know we’ve got some of it right, and some of it wrong. And we don’t usually want to be told which is which. Right?”
“Sure,” Silvia said.
“But here’s the thing,” Claire said. “How are either the Guard or the Gypsies to blame for the Tyne taking our homes and flats? I mean, maybe those wankers in London, sort of, but how are we to blame for that?”
Raefe felt the silence as thoughtfulness. Claire had gotten them past the posturing, she had sensed a way in. He could feel that she knew it, and she was excited by it.
“She’s got a point,” Sean said. “It’s bigger than either side.”
“It is,” Ganesh said, quiet until now. “But it’s not so big that we can’t do something about it. That’s all we’re after. Right now, we can’t get nothing done because of the Guard. We just want a stand down. We don’t make no money off of these projects. So we got nothing to pay the tax. And not to get too technical, but there’s no law says we have to.”
There was a bit of a giggle. Raefe realized they all thought that following the law was a humorous idea. When had the law ever helped them? Ganesh had understood that and played that part down enough without surrendering it.
“’Cept when someone’s holding a gun on you, then it is a law,” Gordo said. “So we know you all think the world of Brian and you’re proud of the North standing up. We just want it to be a real stand up, something more than a football song. We want it to mean we live better. Brian will make his own way, never you mind, but down here in Newcastle, we need to make ours, too.”
Raefe could feel that the ice was thinning. The fact that the Gypsies had stood their ground, but hadn’t turned it into a punch up, impressed them. And the Gypsies could sense that, even with their rudimentary training. He was impressed by how Claire had broken the problem down, how Ganesh had focused the conflict down to something manageable, and how Gordo had appealed to their best instincts. Now was the time to take it to the next level — he glanced over at the Gypsies and pulled his ear. It felt corny as hell, but he knew what followed could be life-changing for them.
It only took him a few seconds to find their minds and begin to entangle with all of them. For now, he would have to be a hub, connecting all of them through him. He let them feel the sincerity of Gordo’s last statements about Brian and Newcastle. They’d see that he didn’t like McDornish at all, but that he would go down fighting for Newcastle and everyone in the room if it came to that. Someone let out a small gasp.
“What was that?” Silvia said, a startled look on her face.
“You’re feeling Gordo’s emotions,” Raefe said. “You’ve heard of empaths, right?”
They all nodded.
“I’m one,” he said. “I’ve been working with the Gypsies to understand that we  all have much more in common than what divides us. I know, you’ve heard that before. But have you felt it? Deep in your gut? That’s when we get past the ‘how do I know you’re not lying’ part.”
Sylvia stared at Gordo. “You have kids, don’t you? I can feel that you carry that weight. And that you miss them — don’t you see them?”
Gordo stared at the floor, weighing his words. He looked up, his cheeks hardened but his eyes shiney moist.
“They’re gone. Superflu epidemic in ‘78.”
“It’s why you’re so angry at the Guard,” Margaret said. “I never realized that before.”
She turned to Silvia. “Janet tried to get them treatment, but at that time, you couldn’t get a Health Services card for Northern England unless you swore allegiance to the Guard. And he’s too proud to do that if he didn’t mean it.”
“And you don’t all mean it,” Claire said. “I see that now. You want it to be true, all that Northern pride stuff, but you have your doubts.”
“But we all do what we have to do to get over,” Ganesh said. “And then we try to be hard about it, because it hurts to admit we’ve been made to do something we didn’t really want to do.”
The room was quiet, just the city’s sounds in the distance.
“Well, it’s something to get used to,” Sean said. “But I see now that it’s rubbish that you Gypsies are just losers and druggies trying to wreck the Northern Guard. I can feel what pains you, and it’s not a hell of a lot different than our lot. That’s a start. I feel like maybe we’ve been looking at things the wrong way.”
Several heads nodded.
“Just rubbish,” Ron said. “Or witchcraft.”
Oh, Ron, Raefe thought. You really don’t understand. Now they can feel your defensiveness, how you’re worried that all the favors McDornish promised you might evaporate. They can feel your selfishness, not your dedication to the cause.
“Funny Ron,” Silvia said. “Witchcraft, really? Feels natural to me, like when you have a close mate and you can see on their face or how they walk what’s eating them. Only more so. Why are you so dead against it? Maybe they’re on to something, maybe we were meant to know this about each other. I’m all for the Northern Guard, but who’s to say they have all the answers? Maybe there’s other ways, too. Doesn’t have to be all one way, does it? How does that help us?’
“Jesus Ron, what have you done?” Margaret yelled suddenly.
Raefe felt it too. Ron was thinking about danger and how to save himself. He had set them up somewhow. Before Ron could answer, a window cracked and there was thud just behind Raefe’s head. He had a mental image of a man looking through a gun sight. He started to yell a warning, but everyone in the room knew what gunfire was. They all hit the floor.
He looked toward Gordo, as if to say, “what now?” Gordo looked over to Claire and Ganesh, and they nodded.
“We’ll get you out of here,” Sean said. “We’ll be fine. It’s you they want, I’m thinking. Silvia, take them out the back!”
Silvia was pulling his wrist, Sean rolled him across the floor toward her and the stairs. He sensed their plan and nodded, the three of them bolting down the stairs with Ganesh following  through twisted alleys, half ruined. He must have grown up here, he thought, he runs through here like a child at play. Raefe’s last impression of the room they had left was Sean’s anger at Ron.
“We were blind,” Silvia said, sensing what he did. “We’ve got a lot to sort out now. I can take you to the edge of the district. I don’t know if we’ll ever meet again, but if we do, it will be as friends.” </Text>

Dadaab
October 28, 2081
“Dad’s in trouble,” Nyssa said. “He’s in Newcastle with the Urban Gypsies and someone’s shot at him.”
“Isn’t someone always shooting at someone in Newcastle?” Des said. “I mean, I’m happy they missed. But isn’t it the same as if we went to the Caliphate in Nigeria?”
“No, they’ve got intel that someone’s put a hit on him. They need to get him out. Mom wants me to see if Manfred can help.”
“Will he?”
“Maybe. Worth a shot.”
“I’m going to let Adno know. She’d never forgive herself if something happened to Dad and she could have helped but didn’t know.”
“Yeah, alright. I’ve got to go to the comms tent to contact Manfred. See you later.”
Citizens of Nowhere had become a huge presence in Africa, but they had maintained the discipline of migrating and hiding. At any one time, Dadaab was no more than a few thousand people, and many of its small buildings were tents, hidden in clumps of forest that the Citizens had restored with careful use of many of the techniques they had absorbed with the New Voodo Army. Nyssa found her way to one of those outposts, the tent where they communicated with the Net and the outside world.
Des might be her twin but they were nothing alike. She was the athlete, he was the intellectual. She was the people person, he would have been shy but for his strong empathic abilities. It was Des who had architected their whole external comms to disguise that their Voice calls and puter connections were coming from Dadaab. Calls from Dadaab would be inconvenient for many of the people around the world they talked to. So everything they did went through complex spoofing routines and bounced around many times before finding its intended receiver. It was a cat and mouse game, but Des was good. And besides, he used his empathic abilities to glean details about infosecurity any time he had the chance to connect with someone from the corpo world.
And now I get to use all that to make what might be the most important Voice call I’ve ever made, Nyssa thought.
“Manfred, how are you?”
“Good, good. What’s up?”
“You know, nothing much changes here. Was just thinking of you.”
Manfred laughed. “Really? I won’t even try to guess.”
“Well, you know that old light-skinned man who was always on your case when we were teenagers?” She hoped he would catch on to her veiled descriptions.
“Yes, how could I forget him?”
“He’s having some health issues. We sent him to Northern England — the doctor thought the cold would be good for his lungs. But it hasn’t worked.”
“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. How can I help?”
“The doctor in Northern England thinks there is a hospital in London that might be able to help. But you know how hard it is to get from Northern to Southern England. We wondered if you might be able to help.”
She waited while he thought about it. His tone had been friendly so far. Maybe that was just a businessman being neutral.
“I might. Can you tell me more about where he is and where he wants to go?”
“Not really. We had a call from him this morning, and honestly, he sounded in a bad way and we didn’t ask too many questions.”
“I’ll tell you what. I have some business in Wales tomorrow. Sometimes I like to take a tourist boat along the north coast — it’s a beautiful view. They stop in Liverpool for tea and then turn around. It’s a bit of an international place there. If he can get himself there today after tomorrow — say 3PM — I can chat to him about what would work best for him.”
“I’m sure his family will be very grateful,” she said. “I’ll let him know.”
“Sure, always happy to help someone from the old days.”
“You take care, Manfred. Good speaking with you.”
She found Raefe’s signature and connected with him. He conferred a bit with his protectors and they agreed on the plan. Keeping in mind that it could be a setup, they agreed that they’d have watchers and an extraction plan if it all went bad. Then she let Des and Lina know.
Des had been in touch with Adno.
“She’s very concerned,” he said. “She’s going to use her network of entanglers to scour the Net for any comms that might tell us more. She recently did an analysis of Earth comms and feels that something is in the works, something big. She’s not sure what, though.”
“Good,” Lina said. “I think we are hearing the echo from 10,000 people singing freedom songs. We have been heard, it seems, and now we will know their response.”

Billy Warren could hardly contain his anger.
“Ken, I’m just beside myself here. I’ve put a lot of faith in you. You’ve got that whole Brightstar organization and I ask one favor of you guys and you can’t deliver. Compared to what I’ve offered you, this was nothing. And I got exactly that — nothing — for the asking.”
“I can’t tell you how sorry I am, Billy. We had him all boxed in, we had a man on the scene, in the room. He had already snuck in previously and painted the wall with a UV coating so the sniper couldn’t get confused. He had him lined up. He says the guy moved at the last second, like he knew it was coming. And then they were gone. Those Urban Gypsies are good at hiding in their territory.”
Warren could hear Hank in his ear.
“They’ll be moving Raefe. I’ve got good intel that he’s headed out. Maybe to Liverpool. Make him work this out, Billy.”
“I’ve to sources, too, Ken. And mine say he won’t be in Newcastle much longer. Maybe Liverpool?”
“That might make sense. He could get a ferry their to Ireland. Although I’d put my money on Holland — they’re allies, after all.”
“I’m expecting at least that you take the Liverpool lead seriously. If you want to cover more bases, much appreciated. I understand he’s resourceful. But we need to find him and take him off the board. Keep me posted.”

Traveller’s Perch
March 7, 2082

Green had been dreading this day for months. Hanikori had manipulated him time and time again, pushing him to this moment when he had become a crucial player in ‘Kori’s insane plan to destroy Earth. Green admired Hanikori’s brilliance and his plan for immortality was impressive. Some days, he even thought it was a good idea. The other days, he thought it would never happen but that they would learn many valuable lessons along the way.
But none of that prepared him to help slaughter 10 billion people. Nor to doom a million survivors to the fate of microbes in a lab dish. He had anguished over the whole prospect for a long time. What struck him was that Hanikori had, in fact, never questioned his willingness to do this on a moral level. Why bother? ‘Kori had come to believe he was a god, or maybe even God. His desires were automatically moral, his victims just unhappy accidents. Green knew he was ambitious and sometimes vain, but he would not be a supporting character in this madness.
Of course, he couldn’t tell Hanikori that. He thought long and hard about how to finesse this. And now he had a way.
His part was crucial to the destruction of Earth’s power grid. It was a vast, anarchic system, or more accurately, thousands, maybe millions of systems, each with it’s own idiosyncrasies. Many systems interfaced with several others, they with still others, and so on. Each interface was unique. There was simply no way Warren’s forces could predict the outcome of their actions.
When Hanikori had given Green those secret files last year, they were the specs for all of the power grid controls on Earth. His job was to use the quantum computing power that he oversaw at Timelines to create the most efficient shutdown plan. How fast could he turn out all the lights on Earth, if you wanted to boil it down? And then to use the wormhole interface network to transmit the instructions to Warren’s crew.
He knew that Putnomo had endured endless pressures from Hanikori as well. After some elaborate dance steps between them, they finally had a frank conversation. Putnomo confessed his role in adapting Guardian technology to the humans and transmitting manufacturing and installation instructions to Rosenberg. He was quite doubtful that the humans would succeed. He had tried to tell Hanikori that but he wouldn’t listen. It was like giving a child blueprints for fusion reactor and expecting them to build a working model.
Putnomo might be a laughable figure sometimes, putting on airs, but his people were born to physics. And so it was Putnomo who saw that Timelines were the way out.
“He wants you to transmit a vast amount of information,” he had explained to Green. “That will take a vast amount of energy. Energy and time are related, just as matter and energy are related. If the energy source undergoes selective phase shifts, the transmissions will all go to the same place, but not to the same timelines.”
Green really didn’t grasp it, but the upshot was that it would look like the transmission was going well, but certain bits would go to random other timelines, where there would be no one to receive them or understand or act on them. Putnomo would adjust the central power source to make these phase shifts in response to certain bits of code to render the message unusable in the exact best way. Afterwards, no one would know what had happened, other than that the transmissions would be useless. Green could say he had done his part, and no amount of investigating would uncover what had happened.
None of the Guardians cared about Earth anymore except Hanikori. Green hoped he wouldn’t make a big scene about it. That would only call attention to Hanikori’s misdeeds. Even though the Council were mostly his handpicked crew, Hanikori couldn’t be sure they would countenance such an act of barbarism. Calling Earth a threat was not believable. Green would take the chance.
And he was about to take another chance.
He found Adno’s signature and connected to her through the Wormhole Interface Network.
“How are you, Adno,” he said. “It’s been awhile.”
“You miss me, boss,” she said. “Can’t get along without me?”
“Something like that,” he said. “Listen, some things have come up back here on Traveller’s Perch that I thought we could chat about. But they’re personal, and maybe it would be best to have a more private conversation.”
“Well, that would be easy if I were there or you were here,” she said. “But I don’t know what you have in mind.”
“I have in mind that you know other ways,” he said. “Let’s just say that over the years, certain things have happened that could only be explained that way. It doesn’t bother me, so I never mentioned it. To each his own, and all that. But this would be a good time to let me in on it.”
She cut the connection. Was she spooked? Or making preparations? Only seconds later, he felt her signature, and like that, they were connected outside the network.
“Ok, what’s the big secret?” she asked.
“Hanikori hasn’t just decommissioned the Earth project,” Green said. “He’s got his own plans for Earth, and quite frankly, they’re insane. I don’t expect you to do anything about them — that’s my problem — but I want you to know. Candidly, I want a witness should this ever come to light. Are you willing?”
“Depends.”
“On what?”
“Well, I know that he has recruited some people on Earth to create a private colony of their most elite citizens to live underground. And that he’s given them promises of long life and advanced powers in exchange for that. And that he wants to provoke conflicts that could well lead to the extermination of the rest of humanity. So what do you have to add to that to atone for your participation?”
Green was stunned. “How do you know all of that?”
“You think I am a stupid fish that swims all day on a silly watery planet with only a few smart birds like yourself to look after us. My people have entangled for their entire existence. They can entangle in the millions. They can combine their powers in many ways. We use these powers to help life and I used them to help Earth when that was my role.”
“Earth will need my help, as well,” Green said. “Hanikori asked me to prepare instructions for the humans that will allow them to destroy their power grid in a matter of minutes, never to work again. I can prevent that.”
“Then you should. And I will be your witness.”
“Thank you.”
“And what will you do to stop Hanikori from destroying the Guardians?”
“Why do ask that? What is it you think he is going to do?”
“He wants all the Guardian people to become immortal, to become pure energy.”
“You think that is a false goal?”
“I am immortal already. Born into my school, I have the memories of all who went before. And those after me, they will have my memories. I live a very rich life. But I also get to feel the cools of the water, the lights of the planets, the beauty of my mate partners. Why would I give that up to be lightning in a bottle?”
“Your school will die off someday.”
“And so will the universe. Frankly, it will get bored first.”
“You have your own view, but the rest of us don’t live in schools.”
“You already live in a school, just one that is not self-aware. Your school could evolve these forms of thought and being in time. You could help. We could teach. Your choice.”
Green was confused. He had thought she would be a good, simple-minded witness. Now she was asserting that she was a higher life form.
“You’ve given me much to think about. For now, I just want you to know this. I hope you will not share our conversation with people who would take it the wrong way. The consequences could be dramatic for me. And I wish you and the humans luck. Just remember that I did what I could.”
“My school will remember this forever. Your secret is safe with us.”</Text>

Greenbrier, W. VA
March 22, 2082
Warren sat on the porch of the old Greenbrier, a 200 year old bottle of Cognac on the little table next to him. He let the liquor feel the warmth of his hand on the snifter, shaking the glass ever so slightly. He raised the glass and let the brandy touch his tongue. Nectar of the gods.
And tomorrow, they would become gods, after a fashion. He would board his private jet and fly out into the middle of the country to a place where earthquakes and floods hadn’t happened for centuries. He would descend deep under the Earth to the amazing underground city that they had built.
Around the globe, his colleagues would do the same. In the end, they had decided against one large colony. The Asians wanted to stay in Asia, the Americans in America, the South Americans had picked somewhere in Brazil, and the Africans in Africa. The Euros, well they had fallen apart. No stomach for it. He had agreed to take some of them on. Hell, America’s best days were as a European refuge, so why not?
“You seem pleased with yourself.”
Hank, always Hank.
“Yes, my friend, it’s been a long time coming, and we’re almost there. At some point, a celebration is in order.”
“We are ready with our preparations. Your people will get all the info I promised. But you still have not delivered Raefe Epstein Miller.”
“Miller? You still worried about him and his hippy dippy friends?”
“You think he is a joke?”
“I think he is a fraud. No one can read people’s minds. Or transmit thoughts to them.”
“How do you think it is that we communicate?”
“I don’t know. Some kind of advance electronics?”
“You have a lot to learn, my friend. But many years to learn it. Good luck tomorrow.”
“Thanks. I always favor having thousands of people working on something to luck.”</Text>

Des had become the tactical commander of Everywhere. His links to people and computers gave him an immense field of knowledge about the continually evolving situation. For now, Adno’s school backed him up, sorting through the data and evaluating threats around the globe. Today was the day when it would all go down.
“You are good leader of school,” Adno said.
“I thought you were the leader,” Des replied.
“Oh yes, of my school. You will see in time that a real school has no leader, or it has leaders everywhere. That is its strength. I meant leader of your school, the humans.”
“God, I hope not.”
“You are funny person for a human. Tomorrow you will see what I mean. Today, we have good news.”
“Bring it on.”
“We have confirmed that our friend on the council has done his part. Some of Earth’s grid will shut down, I’m sure, because the corpos don’t need our tech to shut everything down. But it will remain a coherent world-wide system, your Net. You will not be thrust into the cold deeps.”
“Excellent. Dad has absorbed your lessons. I feel very good that he will be able to link up with millions of empaths around the world. And that they will be able to sustain a waveform for long enough for the message to get out.”
“What about the corpos?”
“They’re all headed to their mouse holes. We’ve discovered where they are and we can deal with them later.”
“You are right to do that. They are the past. You are the future — keep your mind on that.”</Text>

Diver hesitated. He wasn’t thinking straight, or he’d realize that no matter what she did, it could still be the product of his own mind. But now was not the time for a logic lesson. She ordered her apartment to make one wall a mirror and looked at it. She let Raefe see what she saw.
Raefe stared for a long time. She was upright, but in a vaguely bird like way. She didn’t seem to be wearing clothes to speak of, but was covered in what appeared to be purple and green feathers. Her legs were squat and thick at the top, rather like a falcon. She had two arms, but there was something not human about them — they were rotated differently at the shoulders and her hands had six fingers. She had a thumb, but her other five fingers were more equal in length.
But it was her face that was most striking. It was round, with wide unblinking eyes and tiny ears. Purple and green streaked it like some kind of warpaint. And she had lips, but they were hard, as if someone had trimmed a bird’s beak into small ridges.
“I could never imagine you,” he finally said.”How big are you?”
“I would only come up to your waist,” she said. “Our gravity is similar to yours, and our ancestors flew, so they could not be huge. We have actually grown taller since we lost the ability to fly.” </Text>

November 8, 2048
Diver had to contact Raefe soon. She knew what his first question would be, and so she searched for Far Flier in the waveform. What had he done about Lina?
Just as she sensed Far Flier, he walked into her quarters.
“I know you want to contact Raefe right now,” he said. “There’s a lot I need to explain to you, but it will have to wait. Just for now, tell him that Lina is alive. She’s in Kenya, which was part of Efricar in her original timeline. But in this timeline, they have not met.”
“But she will carry recent memories, no?” Diver asked, “Just as he does?”
“Yes, she will understand the last year or so of her old life, similar to him.”
“He’ll be relieved. When can we talk further?”
“Just find me when you’re ready. We have much to do.”
She had a lot more to ask him, but she put all of her questions aside and let her mind drift into the wormhole interface network, which now connected to Earth in the new timeline. She had not entangled with Raefe in this timeline yet — the first time in a new timeline was always a bit tricky. She thought of his thought pattern in the same way she would remember a face in a crowd. As the complex waveform coming from Earth in the new timeline washed over her, she looked for his signature. There!
“Mars Girl! It’s about time!” Raefe said, sounding not a little bit peeved. “Me and my new self have been waiting for hours for you to explain what the heck we do now.”
“Perhaps we should use my real name, eh? Raefe from this timeline, I’m Diver From Great Heights, or Diver to most people. I am an ambassador from the Guardians, an ancient organization of 20 worlds in this galaxy that have intelligent life. We work to foster and protect emerging intelligent species, such as your own, throughout the galaxy,” she said. “I’m sorry that you’ve been awake for hours. Things don’t always line up exactly from one version of a world to another. I’d hoped to contact you while you were asleep, since you always enjoy hearing from Mars Girl in your dreams.”
“Well, if we’re going to get more real, than show me who you are. I really need to know I’m not going crazy, that I haven’t made you up.”
Diver hesitated. He wasn’t thinking straight, or he’d realize that no matter what she did, it could still be the product of his own mind. But now was not the time for a logic lesson. She ordered her apartment to make one wall a mirror and looked at it. She let Raefe see what she saw.

“I would only come up to your waist,” she said. “Our gravity is similar to yours, and our ancestors flew, so they could not be huge. We have actually grown taller since we lost the ability to fly.” 
“What did you do?” Raefe asked. “I’m asking for both of us. I didn’t have time to ask you before.”
“The Guardians have a much more advanced knowledge of physics, as we’ve discussed before,” she said. She’d heard other Guardians talk about how awkward these “we know more than you” conversations with less advanced species could feel, and now she knew what they meant. “But some scientists in your world have already started exploring the idea of the multiverse. Without going into great depth, the quantum nature of reality means that there really are an infinite set of possible universes at any given moment. Some of the possible ones are also actual — they exist in different quantum spaces. We can’t physically travel between our own universe and others, but we can send energy between them, just as we send energy through the wormhole to have these talks. To save you from the tidal wave on Truro Island, we’ve sent the energy that is the waveform of your consciousness to this version of Earth, to this Raefe that has always lived on this version of Earth, that you and I are both experiencing for the first time.”
“You’ve given me a second chance, a replay?” he asked. She could feel a mixture of incredulity, relief and confusion emanating from him.
“Exactly!”
“So what do I do now?”
“That’s up to you, Raefe from this timeline. You are still you. You’ll find that Raefe from the other timeline only remembers things in the last year or so of his life, and mostly the more recent things. Of course, most of your personality is older than that, so it won’t take long before the strangeness fades and you’ll just accept that you’ve visited some places, know some people, and had some experiences that don’t exist for you in this world. Think of it like visiting a place when you were younger that made an impression on you, but no longer exists. But Raefe from the other timeline has strong feelings about certain things and those feelings may well persevere and become a part of you, too.”
“And if I tell anyone about this, they’ll have me sent to a mental hospital, right?”
“That is a likely outcome, yes. Your society is centuries away from accepting this as possible, let alone normal. So it’ll be our little secret.”
“Shit! Speaking of crazy stuff, who is Lina?” Raefe asked. “My new other self seems very intense about her.”
“Yes, Raefe and Lina were a dyad in the other timeline, although they had not yet reproduced together. In this timeline, unfortunately, you have never met. She is still in Africa, where her Chinese father went to work and met her African — Kenyan to be precise — mother, and where she was born. But she is alive and well and remembers you and remembers that you were lovers.”
“Well, nice to know I get a girlfriend in the bargain,” Raefe said. “So what am I supposed to do? Post online: ‘Nice Jewish boy interested in Afro-Chinese woman from a different timeline looking for empathic mate?”
“It’s a bit more complicated than that. Over the next few days, I will visit you and tell you what you need to know.”
“This is so weird. Can you explain this to me again? I mean I already heard my new inner self’s explanation, but I’m not sure he got it right.”
“All of the Guardian species can send their thoughts instantly across space through wormholes, and that they can receive other people’s thoughts the same way. That’s what we’re doing now, actually. But we can do something else, too: we can send a person’s consciousness across not only space, but time.”
“So where I was before it wasn’t 2048?”
“No, we can’t send thoughts to the past or future. But we can send them to many different presents. I realize your species hasn’t discovered this yet, although some of your scientists have examined the idea.”
“Yes, and some of our habitual drug users, as well. You’re kidding me, though — that’s really true?”
“Yes. We exist in many universes, each different in many ways, subtle or obvious. Just as there are universes where you don’t exist. Because random events that led to your existence never happened, or because random events led to your destruction. In this case, a tidal wave on Earth in one timeline caused your death there. The Raefe from that timeline, you have a deep memory of a beach on the island where you stood with Lina, holding her hands, where you told her you loved her? There is that beach in this world. In this universe, it’s not on an island because it is still part of Cape Cod. That tidal wave never happened because the Greenland Ice Sheet still exists. And the Surtsey volcano hasn’t erupted, because of many other events that are different in the two universes.”
“You’re telling me that there are other Earths where things are actually more messed up than here?”
“Yes, and you will have to consider what that means to you. Right now, you have been living your life without too much thought of where your world is headed. Now you know that there are versions of your world that are only slightly different but in much worse shape. That’s another way of saying that pretty soon, your world could be in much worse shape.”
“And you think telling me this will somehow enable me to save the world?”
“No, I think by giving you a second chance you and others may somehow save the world. Stress and crisis often accelerate the emergence of new capabilities in living things. There are more people like you now, although none with as strong an empathic ability yet. You, Lina, people as yet unknown — you will be the key to a second chance to turn your abilities from a cause of headaches and sleeplessness into a force to change your world in this one. A second chance to build a life that you will be proud of.”

“How did he take it?” Far Flier asked, sinking into the chair her room made for him when he visited. 
“He’s angry. We’ve disrupted his life, and he doesn’t see why. His abilities have only ever been disabilities to him. I’m counting on his memories of the flood and the refugee camp to spark a sense that he’s dodged a bullet. I talked to him about second chances. I hope he can grasp that, but I leaned into it a bit hard. I wasn’t ambigous about his world’s chances.”
“You may have skirted the line there, but if you had to err, I agree with doing it on that side of the line. I hope he responds. I think you said the right things, though.”
“But I need to understand what the hell is going on here. There are too many secrets between us. How did you transport him to a new timeline without Green’s group? And what did you do with Lina?”
“I would have explained had there been time.”
“Well, there’s time now,” Diver said, the small feathers in the middle of her head just starting to harden, though not yet the full crest her species displayed when threatened.
“I’ve suspected for some time that Green has had his own agenda. Given the importance of the Earth project, I had made contingency plans. Let’s just say that in 800 years of being a Guardian, I have acquired a passing knowledge of everything we do. And friends throughout the different departments. I will tell the Council that I exercised my authority as head to carry out an emergency transport of Raefe.”
“And Lina?”
“They cannot know about Lina.”
“Why? What have you done?”
“I told you that I implanted the knowledge of Raefe and their relationship in her mind so that she would know him when they made contact. How did you think I did that?”
She stared at the garish gold cuffs of his tunic. Why were they so large and bright? Flies Far somehow always managed to be out of fashion, even when he was trying to be fashionable. She realized she was trying to distract herself from the growing realization of what he had done. She could not believe it. She would make him say it.
“How?”
“Like most intelligent life, she had latent abilities to entangle. I brought them to the surface.”
“You used your abilities to change her brain?” Go ahead, say it. Say that you carried out the most forbidden and dangerous of all Guardian interventions in emerging species.
“Actually, I combined with Raefe to do it. That’s why I asked you to have Raefe be with her when his mind was transported. When humans feel deeply about each other, as Raefe and Lina do, they are all but entangled. I could feel the pathways her mind uses to connect to other people. And I, in essence, trained her to feel them by showing her precisely where Raefe’s emotive thoughts were in her mind. Time will tell how well she takes to it, but she is now a rudimentary empath and an entangler as well.”
“But you know it was wrong. It’s always been a guiding principle of the Guardians — we guide, we don’t direct. We use what evolution has given our contacts, not what we can reprocess them to be.”
“I know it is illegal. And risky.”
“Yes, and you have put her at risk, not to mention the entire Earth project — and the nine billion people on the planet — at risk. And what about me? First you lobby for me to guide Earth — why I don’t know — and then you make it unlikely that I will be allowed to continue. I’m wondering if your mind is working properly.”
 “I wanted you in charge of the Earth project because I know you’re honest and you are a true Guardian.”
“What do you mean, a true Guardian? There were dozens of other Guardians who could have taken this on. It’s only a small project — a few thousand promising latents to monitor and a handful of active entanglers, with only one sufficiently far along to actually contact.”
“I have shielded you from too much,” Far Flier said. “I see that now. As head of the Guardian Council, I cannot share all with you. But as two people trying to do the right thing, we have to share more of what we know. And that is on me.”
She nodded, waiting for him to drop the wall of reticence she sensed in him.
“Not every Guardian believes in our mission,” he continued.
“You can’t really believe—”
 “Let me finish,” he said. “You weren’t on the Council when certain things happened. For example, when the first Earth project failed. Or when the 100 year assessment was made of new candidate species.”
“No, I wasn’t even a Guardian when the last assessment was done. And I was just an ambassador in training when the Earth project first began.”
“Think of how we Guardians work. We have five main pillars: Discovery, Information Analytics, Ambassadors, Administration and Timelines. Discovery finds inhabited worlds that show signs of intelligent life — gases in the atmosphere that don’t occur naturally, broadcasts, that sort of thing. Information Analytics then monitors those worlds, building up a fuller picture and creating  a profile of what stage of development these life forms are at. They are in charge of the 100 Year Assessments, which set our agenda. At the last one, which was 80 years ago, they presented only one candidate to the Council for an Ambassador.”
“Just Earth? I guess I had never made that connection. Were there really no others?”
“There were four or five others. But several in the Council talked them down. ‘Not promising,’ ‘light years from advancement,’ and so on. And they were barely willing to continue with some of the species we had begun with from the prior assessment.”
“Okay, so Earth is the only game in town. How does that justify rigging the game?”
“This is not about Earth. Don’t you see? The very existence of the Guardian mission is being called into question. If Earth is our only project, and Earth fails, what purpose do we serve? Ask your colleagues in Information Analytics — do they think there are more worlds to guide? Not likely.”
“Well, what if it’s true? What if we have fulfilled our mission and identified all the civilizations that both needed our help to advance and warranted our involvement to prevent them from becoming a threat? At least for now, and in this region of the galaxy?”
“I think it would be more accurate to say that we aren’t looking very hard, and we aren’t very eager to try any more. We have done nothing to expand our search area or to refine our assessments in centuries. I’ve come to believe that a growing number of Guardians, particularly on the Council, have lost sight of our purpose.  I’m going to call this issue at the next Council — I hope to reignite the fires. But I implore you not to bring up Lina. With Raefe, I will take responsibility for bypassing the usual procedures. But if we acknowledge Lina’s transformation, that will become the only issue on the table and the consequences will be dire. I know I’ve lost your trust, but I hope you will come to see that I made a hard choice to preserve our work with Raefe, and with the humans, because otherwise, the odds of their survival are quite low.”
“I am deeply torn over this, Far Flier. I find myself uncomfortable with both the affection I had for you and the distrust I’m feeling now. You will know tomorrow what my decision is about Lina. But it may take me longer to come to decide what our future holds.”
After he left, her anger faded to sadness. Saving Raefe and Lina should have been a moment of joy, a continuation in their adventure together of the mind, body and spirit, a step toward a bright future. Far Flier had spoiled that with his disdain for their code. Or was she naive to think that the code deserved more respect? She was disappointed to even be contemplating this.
Many Guardians had trouble understanding what life was like for species who had only what evolution had given them, whose lives lasted only a century or so. Such a life seemed so incomplete, fleeting, fraught with loss and unrealized dreams. Just now, she felt closer to a life of transient joy and unpredictable loss than she ever had before.
