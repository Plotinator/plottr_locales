Meg tries to follow Joseph but she only goes to the shops. He puts it down to practice as she hasn't seen him.
When he watches her go back into the house, he sees Geoffrey's cousin, Walter, leaving, so follows him. Walter makes his way down to the river, to one of Geoffrey's boatyards, where he meets two men. The three discuss something, with much pointing. Meg tries to get close enough to hear but they spot him and chase him off. Thankfully, he is not recognised, but has to go home.
