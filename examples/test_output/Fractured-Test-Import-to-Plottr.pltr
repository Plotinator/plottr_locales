Second, Ma was happier, lighter when Pa was not around for this long. She was was sad for the baby, sad for Bee but you couldn’t mistake the smile, the energy, the life in her when he was gone.  She did double duty during these last two months, taking over the chicken coop, mucking the barn, selling the eggs. We both neglected the field, but with the drought it didn't much matter. She said the work did her good, and that she wanted me to rest, but I was more worried about Bee.\tPa called Bee a fat pig during the last few months of pregancy. A name we took to with affection since it meant he left her alone which was another silver lining. Most significant though, there wouldn’t be a little Pa around to feed and raise. What was the sense in that? Pa’s Pa was no good, Pa was no good, I was no good, Bee was good but messed up, so likely Pa’s baby’s baby wouldn’t be much better.

He had been a person-of-interest in a still open murder case but they didn't have enough evidence for the murder but turned up the theft during the investigation. He had stolen car parts out of a junk yard for an old clunker he’d won in a back alley craps game. He was fixing it up, seeing how that was the only way he’d ever have a car. His daddy, who called Bobby 'Raca' from the bible meaning 'foolish', beat him stupid for getting caught, yelling at him that only idiots steal from junk yards. \"Smart folk steal electronics, jewelry, or other high-end crap that you can sell for real cash,\" his pa yelled.

For once in his life things went Bobby’s way. The bosses got a twofer: Bobby could dig like the rest, but he could also fix anything that might break along the way. Before Bobby arrived, if something broke they’d radio for the mechanic and it would take him while to arrive. The guy could fix anything, but he was too old to dig, with lungs too weak for the bad tunnel air. "

I headed out to the barn where Pa kept his hunting gear. I gathered up his backpack and loaded it with his night vision binoculars, some flares, extra ammo, and his hunting knife. In the kitchen, I made a peanut butter sandwich and tossed it and a bottle of water into the backpack. From his bedroom, I grabbed Pa’s hunting rifle with his day/night ATN X-Sight scope. I caressed the scope remembering how much it meant to Pa, but caught myself––the combined cost of the scope and the night vision binoculars had cost more than the combined total of everything he had ever given to Ma and me. Often we didn't have enough money for groceries, but he always had money for beer and hunting gear. She deserved more. I had to find her. I shook off the memory and went back to the house."
