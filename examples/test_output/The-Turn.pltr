Two year’s later, days of severe lightning had finally blown up transformers in the old bus yard, starting a fire that burned everything for blocks. Worse, it spewed chemicals from the equipment and burned buses all around and some of it had seeped into the water. The dying city and state government had given up on North Cambridge after that. The city was being squeezed on all sides, shrinking in toward the higher ground in the middle, and they focused their efforts on hardening that against the constant storms.

What was different now was the river. The ever-changing climate of the 21st century had wracked the St. Lawrence. Meager snow melt had decreased the river at its source in Lake Ontario. The river had dropped so far and slowed so much that Quebec had been forced to build dams along it and ever more canals to keep the shipping traffic that underlay much of its economy viable.

Trees and grasses had been planted, irrigation had been constructed. He had seen the 3D printers, the AI farm that churned out the patterns for them, the solar and wind farm that powered them all. Four new homes had been built from what seemed like thin air. They would be net negative carbon homes, slowly drawing down the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In a century or two, if the world followed suit, they might be back to mid-20th century levels. Twice as long, preindustrial levels. If they could survive that long, they would succeed in reverting to a more natural state.

And I’m not the only one that feels that way. Here on Traveler’s Perch, the representatives from the other worlds are somewhat acclimated to it. But I know from some of them that people on their home world’s are beginning to sense that something’s changed and they are questioning it. I know Anti thinks that Adno’s people are the one example of a species that doesn’t quite fit with the rest of us. But I think it may not be so cut and dry. For one, I suspect one or two more have also hidden some of their abilities. And perhaps some others know that there are other species on their worlds who are also different, but have great potential to one day become Guardians, even if that’s half a million years from now. But maybe, just maybe, it’s also now.”"
