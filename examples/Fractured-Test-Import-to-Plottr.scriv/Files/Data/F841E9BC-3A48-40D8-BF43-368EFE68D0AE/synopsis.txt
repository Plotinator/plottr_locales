Back at home, evening. Suzie sets a place for Bee at the table ***[is this consistent - there is not sexual threat there- maybe have Ma warn Suzie that Pa is bad today, then while Ma is preparing dinner Suzie add the plate for Bee]. Pa hits Suzie for setting a place for Bee at the table. Ma does not try to intervene, but Suzie steps in to keep Pa from hitting her Ma. Suzie is the protector of Bee and Ma. Suzie doesn't need anyone. Suzie believe Bee needs her, provides her a voice but she doesn't need Bee. ***Maybe add something in her about Pa not wanting her to see Mrs. J anymore.
