(Two weeks later? ) Suzie spies on Pa has he returns from one of the nightly outings with Bobby and four other men. She sees him untape wrapped white bricks, and wrapped money from his legs, belly, and back, then go deep into the desert, and returns without them. Suzie is caught spying on him and is beaten, Bee is raped in order for Pa to be able to sleep. Does she really need to be raped again? Maybe too much? Questions Ma to see if she knows about Pa going out at night, and it appears as though she does. Suzie doesn't understand and criticizes Ma - who reacts by almost hitting Suzie - but doesn't. Ends with Ma crying (feeling terrible for almost hitting Suzie) about being just like Pa - and Suzie comforting her saying it's okay.
