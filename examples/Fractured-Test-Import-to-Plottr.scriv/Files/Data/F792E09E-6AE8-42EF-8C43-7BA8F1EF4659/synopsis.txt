Cartel realized the 1st threat was not a hoax. Bobby tells them who the people are in the note: Susan is David's (Suzie's Pa) wife, and Bee is David's daughter (Bobby goes along with the facade because he really sin't sure what's going on). They zero in on David as the one making the threats, but don't understand how they are supposed to return two people they don't have. (Major revelation to reader that the Cartel doesn't have Ma or Bee). During discussion, 2nd threat is delivered. Cartel lash out at Bobby, telling him he has to find David and stop this -- or else; and decides to put an end to this now.
