Opens with Bee giving birth to third (maybe 2nd?) sill born in as many years. Suzie's family and their disfunction is on display: Pa beats Ma, Suzie, and Jacob. Death of babies, and severe drought foreshadow deaths and loss to come. End with Jacob leaving for the army, and Suzie envy of his getting away ***Make Jacob the oldest and maybe he is actually Jeb's son - that is the history between them?? or at least Jeb thinks Jacob might be his. Another reason Jeb hates Pa - that he pushed Jacob away.
