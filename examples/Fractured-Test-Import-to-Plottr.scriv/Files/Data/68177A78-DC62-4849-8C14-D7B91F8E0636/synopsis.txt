She attempts to find Bee again, knowing her Pa might get away with murder. She sneaks back to the mine and searches for Bee with no luck. She is about to leave when she hears Bobby telling the Cartel about Pa's location. She gets an idea. *** Needs to leave message fro Aiden - that she has an idea and is on her way back. When she is leaving she runs into the guards again (the same ones that shot at her earlier) and begin to gang rape her. She gets confused. Her psyche fights with becoming Bee to shield Suzie from the rape, and staying Suzie to fight them off and continue with her plan (which causes even more dissonance because her known plan is to save Bee. Or was the plan to get her Pa all along?). If she chooses to stay Suzie, it forces her to denounce Bee. She decides to denounce Bee. *** How does she get away? Leave her for dead maybe tie her up to a cactus? after they get a call from the boss telling them to get back to the Motor home? Maybe she has the ATV again, and Aiden uses the LoJack to find her? - she never returned the keys.
