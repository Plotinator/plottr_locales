\f0\fs24 \cf0 Turned out, an ATV rode way easier than driving a tractor. I left my truck down the block from Aiden's and rode the three-wheeler home. I headed out to the barn where Pa kept his hunting gear. I gathered up his backpack and loaded it with his night vision binoculars, some flares, extra ammo, and his hunting knife. In the kitchen, I made a peanut butter sandwich and tossed it and a bottle of water into the backpack. From his bedroom, I grabbed Pa\'92s hunting rifle with his day/night ATN X-Sight scope. I caressed the scope remembering how much it meant to Pa, but caught myself\'96\'96the combined cost of the scope and the night vision binoculars had cost more than the combined total of everything he had ever given to Ma and me. Often we didn't have enough money for groceries, but he always had money for beer and hunting gear. She deserved more. I had to find her. I shook off the memory and went back to the house.\
My cell rang. \
"Hello?" \
The voice on the other end sounded demonic. "Time\'92s running out. Return what\'92s mine, or someone dies." The call ended. \
I stood there, frozen. Dread rooted in my every breath. I dropped the cell and ran to each room in the house, then barn, even checked the field. Still no Bee. \
\
With heightened urgency, I started out about 2:00 a.m. Only three more hours of darkness, with first light around 5:00 a.m. \
 Donned in my helmet, I revved-up the ATV. Queazy with fear, I had tossed and turned all night. Every sound, every house-settling thump caused me to jump up and see if it was Bee. I had rationalized away what I knew to be true: the Cartel had Bee. I had to Ma and Bee before, as the caller so clearly stated, 'someone dies'.\
A new moon, and my dark pants and jacket provided me stealth-like cover. The roar of the bike did not. I drove, slow and steady, on the edge of the cleared service road, trying to keep the dust down and the noise to a minimum. \
I stopped to review my notes from when I reviewed the maps of the area. The construction permit showed the new Casino site just up ahead. I pulled over and hid the bike in a thicket of low hanging Palo Verde trees, chocked with mistletoe. The rest of the way was on foot. \
 The darkness comforted me. The sound of machinery told me I was close. I slowed my pace, became more deliberate in my steps. The camp came into sight. The foundation of a building, approximately 70,000 square feet, loomed in silence waiting for the workers to build it into the Casino that I'd seen in the County Recorder's office.\
So the construction for the Casino was real. But no one was working tonight. However, Pa and Bobby worked every night, and only at night. I watched and waited, but the construction site lay dormant. To the north, a flicker of light caught my eye. \
I skirted the west side of the Casino site, creeping toward the North end. Another camp appeared, hidden by a slight drop in elevation. I saw people milling about. Crouched down like a catcher, the hunting rifle with the attached ATN X-Sight lay at my side.

\f0  From my backpack, I pulled out the binoculars, the peanut butter sandwich, and my water, laying them on top of the backpack. I slid the hunting knife, safe in its sheath, into my boot. \
I hunkered down in the brush, prickers scratched my thighs, rocks dug into my stomach. My elbows burrowed into the dirt as they held my shoulders and head up as I peered though the binoculars. \
I scouted the area to get an overview. This camp was set up in a square. On the north side a large, black polished, shiny motorhome, with pop-outs and a patio, something a rock star might travel in, loomed over the camp. Behind it protruded a wooden roof of another building, the size of a small bedroom. \
The west side of the site housed a sturdy metal shed large enough to hold three cars with an attached awning of equal square foot projecting from the front, toward the inside of the square. Opposite the main building on the south side, a covered area led into the construction site. Another smaller, 3-sided metal framed building, sat on the east side, butted up against a hill which completed the rectangle. Its front door faced the center of the square where a few men were working. Equipment, big and small, dotted the area. From excavators and tractors, to welding equipment, small cement mixers, and hand tools. Scattered everywhere were planks of wood, sheets and rods of steel, and garbage. \
Five trucks were parked in front of some port-a-johns, and another two near the fancy motorhome, one of which was the gold Ford dually. I was in the right place. \
The door of the motorhome opened. A man stood in the doorway talking to someone inside. When he turned to exit the building, Aiden's face came into focus.\
So, he did work for the Cartel, I kept him in my site. My face felt flush, my hands trembled, but eased when I realized he could know where Ma and Bee were.\
Aiden carried a canvas bag and a suit case to his truck and drove off. My muscles twitched. That confirmed it. Aiden was corrupt. He drove off, I wanted to follow him, to confront him, but glancing back at the camp, I decided to stay. I'd find out what Aiden was doing another way. 	A man walked into view and started up his truck. Four others followed him and jumped into the back of a black pickup. I backtracked their path to the entrance of the covered area leading to the construction site. A herd of men trudged out, way to many for the area under cover. Their dragging feet were pulled along by slumped shoulders and lowered heads.\
I adjusted the binoculars to zoom in on the motor home. As I focused on the front door, it flung open and a man stared right at me. I jumped and banged the binoculars against the bridge of my nose. My heart pounded. Had they seen me? \
Deep breath. Calm down. \
He couldn't have seen me. \
Sloth-like, I raised the binoculars into place. The man stood at the bottom of the stairs. A white cloth apron tied at his waist, covering his thighs. He headed toward the building behind the motorhome with, what appeared to be, a tray of food in his hands. \
A flicker of movement behind the east side shed caught my eye. From my southeast vantage, I had a clear view of the back of that building. I focused the binoculars. With his back towards me, he poked his head out, sneaking peaks at the motorhome\'92s front door. The irony of me spying on a man spying, didn't escape me. Who was this? 	He whipped around and slammed his back against the rear wall of the shed.\
I scanned to the front door of the motorhome to see what had spooked him. Gold-man stood on the porch holding open the door as a southern gentleman might do for a lady. Another man, older, more dignified, less blinged-out than Gold-man, walked out and down the steps. Gold-man followed like an obedient dog. Dignified-man walked over to the patio area and stood next to a table and chairs, while Gold-man\'92s eyes hunted within the flock of men.\
I swept back to hiding-man. With his back still against the wall, I got a good look at his face. \
I gasped. \
Impossible. \
I dialed in the focus-wheel again. I alternated between the looking at him through the binoculars and with my naked eye. \
It was Pa.\
My heart raced. Consecutive waves of relief, sadness, and anger crashed over me. I lowered the binoculars and tried to clear my eyes. It must be the shadows, the night vision distorting things, the late night, something. With the binoculars back in place, he looked in my direction, almost as if he had heard me. No doubt, Pa was alive. I watched him as he disappeared into the darkness surrounding the perimeter of the site. \
A ruckus broke out in the camp. Gold-man had found his quarry and moved in, yanked his prey out from the crowd, and slammed him down in front of Dignified-man. \
I watched the confrontation unfold, distraught by the thought of Pa being alive. I zoomed in as much as the binoculars allowed. Gold-man stood nearby guarding Dignified-man, not from the prey dropped at his feet, but from the potential danger in front of Dignified-man, specifically the pack of men, now stopped in their tracks, glaring at Gold-man. \
I focused back on Dignified-man; his face contorted, spit flying as he spoke. Looking back to the gang of workers, their blank faces came alive, they leaned and whispered to each other, heads shook, feet shuffled, but all for naught. They cowered within their pack like caged mice. \
I panned over to the worker-man being berated. I twisted the focus wheel in, once again denying who I saw. \
Bobby. \
Dignified-man looking more like a ruthless drug lord now, held a gun under Bobby\'92s chin while holding him close with his fist wrapped tight into his shirt. A stain appeared on Bobby\'92s crotch causing Gold-man to break out in a deep, evil laugh I heard from here. Without notice, Dignified-man whipped the hand holding the gun, out from under Bobby\'92s chin, and back to his right, clipping Gold-man\'92s jaw, and just as quick, back under Bobby\'92s chin. \
I heard my heart beat. My eyes widened to take it all in. \
A few more words were spewed, and Dignified-man gun-whipped Bobby across the face, then shoved him to the ground. Dignified-man ejected the chambered bullet from the gun, and tossed it onto Bobby, and walked back to the motorhome door. Gold-man, still rubbing his jaw, sucked air, but rushed to keep up with Dignified-man, and closed the door behind them. \
With the 'don\'92t-mess-with-me' message received, the mice, masquerading as men, scampered into their trucks and peeled out of camp. \
I swept to Bobby, still on the ground. Minutes seemed like an hour before he moved. With the help of a chair, he got to his feet and stumbled to his truck. His truck mates had abandoned him.\
I slumped flat on the ground and rolled over, trying to absorb all that I had seen. I had more questions than answers. \
A twig snapped nearby. My senses heightened. My ears to pierce the darkness. I didn\'92t move. The sound edged closer. Adrenaline pushed a snake-like shudder through my body. \
With the backpack in one hand and binoculars in the other, I jumped to my feet and ran. \
A shot rang out. I kept running. The darkness, the fear, the gunshot disoriented me. But I fled, until I tripped and rolled into a shallow ravine. I quickly snugged under the brush in a fetal position, shifting a tumble week in front of the brush. Another gun shot rang out. Foot steps approached, and stopped. I held my breath.\
"Probably just a Javelina," said a man.\
"Yeah," said another man. \
They didn\'92t move. I couldn\'92t move. \
"Let\'92s get back. Whatever it was, it\'92s gone." \
"Yeah. Let\'92s not report this. Coming back empty-handed, well, let\'92s not mention it." \
"Roger that." \
I hid in the ravine long after I heard the last of their footsteps. A quick glance at my watch signaled less than 30 minutes before first light. \
My throat tightened; my stomach flipped. Barely able to breath, I peaked out from under the brush without a sound. The stillness of early morning announced that danger, for the moment at least, had passed. I got up and jogged to the ATV, glancing over my shoulder every chance possible.
