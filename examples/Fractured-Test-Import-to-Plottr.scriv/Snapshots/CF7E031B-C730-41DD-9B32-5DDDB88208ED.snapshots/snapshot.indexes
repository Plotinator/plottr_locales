        <Text>Waves of rising hot air danced just outside the window pane. The ground dry and cracked from years of drought. The unrelenting heat of the next few weeks fueled our sorrow not only for the baby, but also for our farm.  The US Drought Monitor, a popular topic among farmers, had been be raised from D2, Severe drought, to D3, extreme drought. By the government's definition that meant widespread crop losses, heavy water restrictions and shortages.
Before neighbors and friends could utter their last syllable of condolences for another child lost, the Drought Monitor would come up, but we didn't need the US Government tell us it was getting worse. We knew long before they raise the threat level to D3: like DefCon3 for farmers.
The heat didn’t slow Pa’s exit none. He kept to his pattern of disappearing after a still-birth. He’d take the baby’s body and buries it. No name given, no ceremony, no last rights.  Just a cardboard box and a hole in the ground in the back yard. Once he left with the body, he didn’t come back for a few weeks. In the past, he stayed with Uncle Bobby, Ma’s brother.  Ma said it was his way of grieving and allowing us time to grieve and heal. 
"Grieving? Pa?" I scoffed. "More likely his way of paying penance."
"Why? Whatever for?" Ma said. 
She didn’t have a clue. I wanted to ask her who she thought the daddy was but, I knew she couldn’t face that demon, we all had our demons, and who was I to question hers. But she was kind of right, penance didn’t make sense, he’d have to be sorry for that. He was much too selfish for that. He left to avoid the sideway glances and under the breath scoffs from the neighbors who poured through the house daily, offering condolences, baskets of baked goods, bags of food, and casseroles. Dot, our most outgoing neighbor, even brought by her Aloe Vera juice made with her secret ingredient, with specific instructions to drink only a little at a time. Once I tasted it, I understood why guzzling it wasn’t a good idea, but her heart was in the right place. 
Neighbors barely had enough for themselves, but during bad times they always stepped up. Losing a baby was the worst of the bad times according to them. I can’t say I agreed. Several good things came out of it. First, we didn’t have to even think about Pa for a couple of weeks, which also meant no beatings for a while, and Bee could relax. Second, Ma was happier, lighter when Pa was not around for this long. She was was sad for the baby, sad for Bee but you couldn’t mistake the smile, the energy, the life in her when he was gone.  She did double duty during these last two months, taking over the chicken coop, mucking the barn, selling the eggs. We both neglected the field, but with the drought it didn't much matter. She said the work did her good, and that she wanted me to rest, but I was more worried about Bee.	Pa called Bee a fat pig during the last few months of pregancy. A name we took to with affection since it meant he left her alone which was another silver lining. Most significant though, there wouldn’t be a little Pa around to feed and raise. What was the sense in that? Pa’s Pa was no good, Pa was no good, I was no good, Bee was good but messed up, so likely Pa’s baby’s baby wouldn’t be much better. And god forbid if a baby boy had lived––just another generation of beatings up-to-bat. 
People said that time would heal the hurt. I’d just nod, but again, I didn’t agree. There was no hurt to heal. I was never sad the babies died. Never sad they lived so long, protecting us from Pa. I didn’t blame them for coming into this world and saying, "Fuck no." I didn’t feel anything but maybe a little guilt at not really wanting them at all. What kind of person doesn’t want a baby? Regardless, it ended how it needed to end, no sense crying over that. 
 Mrs. Jones was the most persistent of the visiting neighbors. She came by three or four times a week for the first two weeks. She had been mh fifth grade teacher, but had moved away a few years ago with her husband Michael. She moved back after his death two years ago. She had been my fifth grade teacher, but moved away for a few years with her husband, Micheal, before moving back after his death a couple of years ago.//timeline She had always taken an interest in me, probably thought I was a hopeless case she’d save. She brought me books, took Ma places like doctors and such when Pa was busy with the truck, and treated us both kind. We were usually invisible to people like her: educated, worldly with money, and a nice house. Never could figure out her angle, but she never let up, so overtime I just stop trying. 
Through the years, it was during these 'grieving times' as folks called it, she and Ma became friends. They sat in the two overstuffed chairs in the corner and talked and talked while I poured through the books she brought me. One day, a few weeks after the third birth, I heard them talking in the kitchen like they did most days. They were talking about Bee, wondering what to do about her. Talking about her as if she was a problem. They seemed more worried about me, than Bee. I didn’t need their worry, Bee did though. 

The next week Ma and Mrs. Jones called me into the kitchen with them. They suggested it was time Bee go out on her own. It was time, Ma kept saying.  
"What do you think about that, dear?" said Ma.
"I’m not living here with Pa without Bee. If Bee goes, I go." I left the room and went back to my books. That was that. My stomach turned, my pulse quickened. I had no place to go. 
But it didn’t stop them talking. Walls were thin. 
"Now why would she say that?" Ma said. 
"You know, she isn’t wrong," said Mrs. Jones. "She can’t keep going on like this. She’s not a young girl any more. She has to learn that ice doesn’t melt if there is no heat, and that she is strong enough to handle both. People’s tolerance of Bee is waning." 
I could hear them sipping their coffee. 
"It isn’t considered 'cute' anymore," Mrs Jones continued. "She’s got to accept the truth or one of these days she is going to break, and you might lose all of her." 
"She can’t leave. And she can’t stay," said Ma.
I wasn’t sure what they were talking about, but I was sure I didn’t like it. Why would Bee leave? Why couldn’t she stay? They were talking crazy. I’d had enough of this. I walked out the front door, letting the screen door slam so they’d know I’d been listening.</Text>

	Waves of rising hot air danced outside the windowpane of our three-bedroom slump block house. Over the next few weeks, the unrelenting sun wreaked havoc on the already dry and cracked ground. The scorching heat fueled our sorrow for  baby and our farm. The U.S. Drought Monitor had been raised from D2 to D3, extreme drought: DefCon3 for farmers. By the government's definition, that meant widespread crop losses, heavy water restrictions and shortages. We didn't need the government to tell us that. 
Before the neighbors uttered their last syllable of condolences for another child lost, the conversation forked to farming or gossip, but mostly gossip. The main topic being pa. After a still-birth, he’d take the baby’s body and bury it. No name, no ceremony, no last rites. Just a cardboard box and a hole in the ground in the backyard. Once he left with the body, he didn’t come back for a few weeks.
"David gone to stay with Bobby again?" said Dot, our most outgoing neighbor. She had even brought by her Aloe Vera juice made with her secret ingredient, with specific instructions to drink only a little at a time. Once I tasted it, I understood why guzzling the Tequila concoction wasn’t a good idea, but her heart was in the right place. 
Ma nodded. 
"I'm sorry Susan, but I just don't get it. Bobby's your brother. How can he be David's friend. Between, well, you know," Margaret lowered her eyes to the empty bassinet, "and your Pa snubbing Bobby and leaving the family farm to David and not him--and he blood. I'm surprised he can even stand to look at David." 
I wondered if Margaret knew. Seemed like she might. 
Ma had said Pa left to do his own grieving and to allow us time to heal. 
"Grieving? Pa?" I scoffed. "More likely his way of paying penance."
"Penance? Whatever for?" Ma said. 
She didn’t have a clue. I wanted to ask her who she thought the daddy was? Hell, I wanted her to admit who the daddy was, but I knew she couldn’t face that demon. We all had our demons, and who was I to question hers. The clank of Dot' coffee cup on the wood table brought me back. 
"Come on Margaret, would you leave your farm to a convicted criminal? And besides, they never cleared him of," Dot lowered her voice, "that prostitute's murder. That poor family, not knowing what happened to their daughter after all these years."
"Well, he still could have left it to blood," Margaret said, motioning to Ma. 
"Bobby isn't one for confrontation. If he can't talk his way out of something––he just takes it..." ma's voice trailed off, "until he can't." 
Margaret and Dot exchanged glances. 
"Enough of all that." Dot waived her hands, washing it all away. "Did you all see Genevieve in town the other day, carrying that single rose?" said Dot. 
"She's still getting those?" said Margaret. 
"Every week, since their son left for Iraqi," said ma looking out the window.
"You think it's Bob Palmer?" asked Dot. "You know, since his wife died he's been lonely."
"Stop," said Margaret. "He'd never flirt with a married woman. And besides, what does it matter? Gen deserves something nice in her life." 
The women nodded in agreement. 
Ma continued to stare out the window. Was she thinking about pa? She had been kind of right. Pa couldn't give penance, he’d have to be sorry for that. He left to avoid the sideway glances and under the breath scoffs from the neighbors who poured through the house daily, offering condolences, baskets of baked goods, bags of food, and casseroles. 
Neighbors barely had enough for themselves, but during bad times they always stepped up. Losing a baby was the worst of the bad times, according to them. I don't agree. Pregnancy was a respite of sorts. Pa called Bee a fat pig during the last few months; a name we took to with affection since it meant he left her alone. And the stillbirths, those were a blessing too––no little pa's around to feed and raise. What was the sense in that? Pa’s pa was no good, pa was no good, I was no good, Bee was good but messed up, so likely pa’s baby’s baby wouldn’t be much better. And god forbid if a baby boy had lived––just another generation of beatings up-to-bat. 
People said that time would heal the hurt. Again, I’d nod on the outside, but inside there was no hurt to heal. I was never sad the babies died. Couldn’t blame them for coming into this world and saying, "Fuck no." I felt nothing but an emptiness for not wanting them at all. What kind of woman doesn’t want a baby? No matter, it ended how it needed to end, no sense crying over that. 
 
Mrs. Jones was the most persistent visitor coming three or four times a week for the first few weeks. She had been my fifth-grade teacher, but moved away for a few years with her husband, Michael, before moving back after his death. I seemed to be her special project, maybe thought I was a hopeless case she’d save. We were usually invisible to people like her: educated, fancy clothes, and a nice house. Never could figure her angle, but she never let up.
Through the years, it was during these 'grieving times' as folks called it, she and ma became friends, maybe her only friend, at least the only one I ever saw ma take more than a gossip-sharing liking to. 
On Mrs. Jones' most recent visit, she and ma had talked at the kitchen table while I pretended to pour through the books Mrs. Jones had brought me. I heard them talking about Bee, wondering what to do about her. They both looked real serious with their heads leaned in close, voices low, sniping glances at me every now and again. Sometimes Mrs. Jones would put a hand on ma’s knee and ma would put her hand over Mrs. Jones’ hand. They talked about Bee as if she was a problem. They seemed more worried about me than Bee. I didn’t need their worry, Bee did though. 
A few days later, Ma and Mrs. Jones called me into the kitchen with them. They suggested it was time Bee go out on her own. It was time, Ma kept saying. 
"What do you think about that, dear?" said Ma.
"I’m not living here with Pa without Bee. If Bee goes, I go." I left the room. My stomach turned, my pulse quickened. Where would I go? 
But it didn’t stop them talking. Walls were thin. 
"Now why would she say that?" Ma said. 
"You know, she isn’t wrong," said Mrs. Jones. "At eighteen years old, she can’t keep going on like this. She has to learn that she's strong enough to handle it. After all, ice doesn’t melt if there is no heat. People’s tolerance of Bee is waning." 
I could hear them sipping coffee. 
"It’s not 'cute' anymore," Mrs Jones continued. "She’s got to accept the truth or one of these days she is going to break, and you might lose all of her." 
"She can’t leave. And she can’t stay," said Ma.
I wasn’t sure what they were talking about, but I was sure I didn’t like it. Why would Bee leave? Why couldn’t she stay? They were talking crazy. I’d had enough of this. I walked out the front door, letting the screen door slam so they’d know I’d been listening.</Text>
