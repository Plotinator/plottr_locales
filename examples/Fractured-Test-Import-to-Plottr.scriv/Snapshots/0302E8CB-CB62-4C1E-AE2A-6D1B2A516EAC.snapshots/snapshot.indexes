        <Title>Before combing prior scene</Title>
        <Text>Two months passed, Bee was healed, physically at least. Pa returned home after his hiatus to avoid and things returned to normal: his late-night visits with Bee resumed along with the beatings.     
We headed down to The Corner Store owned by Jeb Mannwell. The new Walmart had opened a few months back Walmart opened a few months back //timelineand it had a grocery store right in it, and everything else too. Jeb lowered his prices just before the opening, but he couldn’t compete. But Ma insisted we shop here. Supporting our own, she said, that’s what mattered. More likely we shopped here for the same reason all the other farmers shopped here, because Jeb extended credit to farmers until after the harvest. 
When we walked in, Jeb smiled and nodded to Ma. He ignored me as usual, and like Pa, and most everyone else, never acknowledged Bee. I wasn’t sure what I did to make him hate me so, especially since he went out of his way to be kind to Ma. My very existence, irritated him. 
The National News blared "Breaking News" from the TV overhead. Local Jackson police, during a normal traffic stop on 10th Street, not far from here, seized a semi-truck carrying over 1000 pounds of Marijuana. Not really 'Breaking News' around these parts. Jackson shared the Mexico border with Agua de vida, Mexico, just steps away for many ranches. Over the last two years, Bill Derks had seen 46 trucks drive through his cattle ranch after they cut a wide birth in the fence between the two nations. One of the trucks broke down once, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot in the middle of the night. Bill’s told the story many times about how he stood watch all night on the porch with his shotgun to make sure the driver didn’t have any thought of paying him a visit. Later, authorities seized the truck, and that one too was filled with Marijuana.
The news report stated that despite this recent seizure, Marijuana was declining in popularity among drug dealers, not only because of a wave of legalizations across the States, but also to give way to more profitable, easier to smuggle, and trendier drugs: cocaine, meth, and opioids.
Jeb eyed me like I was scum and switched the channel. "Mind your own business, girl." 
I started to sass him back, but Mrs. Jones appeared from behind the snack counter and grabbed my arm.           
"My goodness, girl, a few weeks of rest did you good. Did you get even taller? What's your Mamma feeding you?" Mrs. Jones said whisking me away from Jeb.
"Hello, Mrs. Jones." Folks always have to tell me how tall I am, as if I didn't know, Mrs. Jones was no different. But I didn’t mind it from her. 
"She bothering you, Caroline?" Jeb said. 
"Shush Jeb. How could this lovely young woman be bothering me." She waived him off. 
"What’s with him? I was only watching the news." I said loud enough for Jeb to hear.
Jeb mumbled something under his breath as he unloaded the cans of Campbell’s Tomato soup onto the shelf. He kept one eye on me, always did. Didn’t matter, he could never catch me lifting, which I only did when things were really bad––and never when Ma was with me. However, she knew when a can of beans, a potato or two, or a loaf of bread magically appeared in our kitchen. She never asked, I never told. 
The other customers either looked right past me, or they’d look me right in the eye, huff and turn away. Couldn’t blame them, most of the time, like today, I’d come straight from the field and imagine I didn’t smell too pretty.
While their wives shopped, Mr. Carter talked with Mr. Darling over by where the guns and ammunition were displayed. They too had been watching the news but knew the story all too well. They had first-hand experience with the illegals crossing. Years ago, when it wasn’t so bad, Mr. Darling would go out and offer them work. Most of them accepted, and worked hard, harder than most. But last few years, it was less like people fleeing a bad situation looking for a better life, and more like a swarm of deadly bees wanting to cause havoc and chaos.    
"How are you Susan?" Mrs. Jones always called me Susan, even though that was my mother’s name. She reached to give me a hug. 
I stepped back. "I’m good, thanks, how 'bout you?" 
"Did you read those books I dropped off last week?"
"Well, eh, only one." I hated when I couldn’t get to her books, but taking care of the Bee, helping Ma, and doing what I could to salvage what was left of our crop were more important, and kept Pa off my back.
"How's things at home, honey?" Mrs. Jones said as she pulled me out of Jeb’s ear shot. 
"Fine," I responded.
"Let me see." She lifted my chin with the middle knuckle of her finger. Turned my face from side to side while she inspected. Then she reached out for my hands, pushed up my sleeves and examined each arm. "You got matching bruises on those legs? Don't lie to me, I'll look for myself." 
Ma was busying herself near the corn basket when I glanced her way. 
I pulled down my sleeves and lowered my head. "Yes, ma'am." Her attention bewildered me. 
She lifted my chin again. "You don't ever have to lower your face to me," her voice grew louder, "or to anyone else for that matter." She looked straight at Jeb. 
I didn’t need to look his way, I could feel Jeb’s blood pressure rising. She was always saying things like that to me. I was never sure what she meant. 
"Yes, ma'am." I said knowing that’s what she wanted to hear.
"I heard you birthed a calf last week, all by yourself and just weeks after the––well you know." 
"More like pulled it out," I said with my head high now, "Betty didn't want to give her up. Some of those bruises on my legs I got the normal way. That calf is paying for these groceries, the Perkins bought her," I said, proud that I negotiated a better deal than Pa thought possible, but he'd never know.  I stored away the extra to give to Ma. Seemed like Pa never gave her enough for groceries, but always complained there wasn't enough to eat. 
"You’re strong enough to wrestle a birthing cafe and keep the mamma down? My girl, you’re strong enough for anything." 
"Like Father John says, The meek shall inherit…" My voice trailed off, embarrassed I was sounding so hoity-toity.  
"Well, Jesus said it first, you know," she chuckled, "and you girl, you are not meek. You are strong, pretty and smart." She bobbed her head. 
She must of been talking to Bee. Covered in salty, sun dried sweat, I was sure I wasn't pretty. My aching arms, burning feet, and back spasms––remnants of the day in the field––didn't make me feel strong. And not getting out of this town by the time I was 18 was proof positive I wasn’t so smart.
"Hey Suzie." Aiden, Jeb’s son, emerged from the back office. "I thought that was you."   
I jump at the sound of his voice but quickly recovered, "Hey, Aiden." His warm eyes and inviting smile told me he had been talking to Bee, not me. I lowered my head hiding the read to hide my blushing. Boys preferred her to me. I didn’t want anything to do with boys; hell, I didn’t much want anything to do with pretty much anybody. She’d smile her coy smile that made boys think she liked ‘em. Even I wasn’t sure if she really did, but hoped, one day, she’d have the sense to kick every last one of them in the nuts, especially Pa. Regardless, she knew how to tolerate them.  
Aiden looked like he swallowed a cat, and before he could catch his breath, Jeb yelled, "Aiden, you get over here and get Mrs. Carter’s groceries to her car." 
Aiden smiled back at Bee, "We should catch up. And be sure to tell Jacob I said hello." 
Folks around town hadn’t yet forgotten about Jacob, most said to say hi when they saw me or Ma. I wasn’t sure what to tell them, we hadn’t heard from him since he left for the Army,//timeline but since we hadn’t heard from the Army either that was enough for me to believe he was safe. 
Aiden trotted over to Mrs. Carter. Watching him as he helped her with her bags, I envied his comfort around people, his ease at talking with them. I missed our talks. I couldn’t help but wonder why he came back here after graduating college. Most kids who get out of here, don’t come back. 
When I turned back, Mrs. Jones was grinning at me. 
"What? I got something on my face?" 
She winked and said, "Not a bad catch, you know?"
 
Ma and me paid for our two cases of Bud, three pounds of hamburger on special because the sold-by-date had passed, and a five pound bag of brown potatoes. First time we'd ever bought potatoes, but the drought had caused a lot of firsts.
