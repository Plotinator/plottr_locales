            <Synopsis>Train trip home.
We get a sense of how the world is organized.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The next day
Raefe woke with a start. Lina was still asleep next to him. He had been dreaming something, he couldn't quite remember, just that Lina had kissed him on the ear right before he woke up.
It was just after 6AM, but he wasn't sleepy. Usually, he hated the last day of a vacation, but he felt strangely animated this morning. That might not be such a good thing, considering they would be on the solar train for 8 hours today. There were faster ways to go than a 250 mph train, but they all involved many more carbon credits than a student could afford.
The little room coffee maker did its thing and he took his cup out on to the balcony. It was a fine January morning. The beach on their little island was nearly empty this early, just a few joggers and dog walkers beating the heat. Small clouds of tiny baitfish erupted here and there as the barracuda chased them. The pelicans watched the barracuda patiently, knowing the sun would warm deeper waters that held more interest to the fish, leaving the shallows to the pelicans.
The tidal waves in '41 had drowned thousands of people. All the blood had drawn huge schools of every predator fish in the south Atlantic. Urban legend had it that the flood had washed tons of Cokke and Wyn into the water from the drug lord neighborhoods, sending the fish into such a frenzy that they never found their way back to their original feeding grounds.
It is just a big ball of water, isn't it, he thought. Billions of years of stuff floating around, reaching for the sun, eating and being eaten, and us just living at the edges, so full of ourselves. He had read about a group of scientists who had taught chimps how to take apart complex machines like motors or 3D printers. They had done something to their brains, and given them some kind of drugs, and it was enough so that the chimps could perform chains of complicated tasks. The scientists had practically given themselves a Musk Prize, they were so impressed with this &quot;synthetic guided evolution.&quot;
The problem was, the chimps couldn't put the machines back together. That was a whole different kind of thinking. 
He realized Lina was standing in the door, watching him.
&quot;Hey, whatcha thinking?&quot;
&quot;Hey. Just watching the 'cudas having breakfast and realizing they used to live hundreds of miles south of here. And thinking, shit, we're just great at breaking things apart, aren't we? And not so great at putting them back together.&quot;
&quot;Wow, where did that come from?&quot;
&quot;You, actually. I had a dream, and you said something about fixing the world.&quot;
&quot;What did I say?&quot;
&quot;That's the problem,&quot; Raefe said. &quot;I can't quite remember. But it was a good dream.&quot;
&quot;Shit, now we're really in trouble. I don't know how to fix the world either. Well, here's to dreams!&quot;
She smiled and downed her coffee. The great mass of her tiger-striped hair had apparently gone anarchist during the night. Yellow and brown strands went every which way, as if her cinnamon skin had separated itself into her mother's East African brown and her father's golden Chinese shades, and flowed like a braided river out into her hair, to be lit up by the morning sun. His gaze lasted a tad too long, causing her to run her finger nervously along the ropey scar tissue that capped her right ear, a reminder of the East African holocaust she could never quite ignore. He reached up and stilled her hand, letting his fingers travel over her scar and into her tangled hair.
&quot;Here's to dreams!&quot; he mumbled, feeling awkward despite his best intentions. She answered with a long kiss.
&quot;Hmm, that was nice,&quot; Lina said. &quot;But dreamy boy, we have a train to catch. Back to reality.&quot;
 They had a quiet breakfast, and packed up their stuff.
Two hours later, they were on a half-empty train. 
&quot;I hope this wasn't a mistake,&quot; Lina said. &quot;Rolling the dice on taking this train.&quot;
Most people avoided the northbound trip in January, not knowing if the snow monsoons would come a little early or hold off until February.  If they caught you on the train, the snow could last for weeks, the train might exhaust its solar batteries and you'd freeze to death. 
&quot;I'm not worried, We'll be back in our little hole in the wall  in East Somerville by the time the snows arrive. This is the perfect time for a cheap trip -- it's cool outside, so we don't have to pay for AC, either.&quot;
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Lina said. &quot;Just looks like everyone on the train is a student or a migrant worker -- no one who had a choice.&quot;
The train headed out of Miami and soon the flat marshes of east Florida were rolling by like an endless video loop, long-legged white birds picking small fish out of the swamps under orange trees long mummified by the salty tidal flow. Raefe turned from the window and noticed a small wirey man was now sitting across the aisle. He looked about 30, and was wearing worn out old military shorts and a Brasil Futbol shirt. 
&quot;Where you headed?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Up between Hilton Head and Charleston,&quot; the man said, Eelton Ed and Sharlston in his vaguely Braz accent.
&quot;What's there?&quot; Raefe wondered. No one went there since the '41 floods had swept over it.
&quot;Salvage.&quot;
&quot;Wow, I would have thought nine years after the floods, there wouldn't me much left.&quot;
&quot;Nothing left from the floods but salt marsh.  I'm a 'cane harvester.&quot;
Raefe was confused. &quot;Sugar cane?&quot;
&quot;No, hurricanes. I follow them up the coast from Brazil from September on. The 'canes wash up tons of stuff – fishing boats, plastic, parts of old shipping containers –– and nobody even knows it's there. All the way up, the places like Hilton Head that were hit in '41 -- no one lives there anymore for miles around. The corpos pay off the big merc companies for sat images, and when they spot big accumulations, they put out word to the 'cane harvester combines. They call me and I salvage it.&quot;
&quot;Wow, you can make a living on that?&quot;
&quot;Sort of. The corpos pay me to catalog the stuff. I put the catalogs on the 'net – 2 tons of usable wood, 1 ton of weldable steel, that kind of thing. Then the corpos have some kind of auction and it gets sold and someone comes and gets it. I get a fee for that end, too. It don't add up to that much, but I also get carbs from some governments and from the Western Hemisphere Restoration Fund, too.&quot;
&quot;Cool. Carbs are good things to have.&quot;
&quot;Most places, better than money. Maybe they'll get the whole warming thing turned around, and I'll be out of luck. But I'll believe that when I see it. I been doing this for 8 years, and carbs are worth more every year.&quot;
&quot;Till they ain't,&quot; Lina said. &quot;You know they're playing you, right?&quot;
&quot;Everybody's playing everybody, near's I can tell,&quot; the drifter responded, trying to size up Lina. &quot;But what do you mean, 'till they ain't'?&quot;
&quot;Where I grew up -- East African Republic --  was full of people like you, drifters,&quot; Lina said. &quot;People whose grandparents had come from the interior, little farm villages, to the cities, who had never really found steady work. They were salvagers, day laborers, any kind of work. Chinese paid them in carbs, too. Didn't work out too great -- sure, they had a lot of carbs, but they had to spend them local or exchange the for the local plastic trash currency. They had some complicated-ass scheme for exchanging carbs, and you know how that shit always works out.&quot;
&quot;Right, they win, you lose,&quot; the drifter agreed. &quot;But so far, the corpos are busy enough making mondo money on trash that my cut don't matter to them. But I can believe it. These corpos, any way they can screw you they will. But I don't stay long enough in one place to spend all my money anyway. And I don't work for one outfit, either.&quot;
&quot;Least as far as you know,&quot; Lina said, unconvinced. &quot;You know money, it all flows one way.&quot;
&quot;Authentic -- away from us,&quot; the drifter laughed. &quot;You pretty smart for a kid.&quot;
&quot;No kids in Efricar,&quot; Lina said. &quot;Just little people trying to live long enough to get big. How's the work, though -- is it OK?&quot;
&quot;It's tough, but I've done worse. They got a camp up there you live in. This place, you have to get around in a kayak – they don't want to spend carbs on motor boats. You paddle around all day, putting 'net tags on stuff and photoing it. You gotta hike through mud and muck for a lot of it. And there's always snakes and bugs.&quot;
&quot;Maybe not my thing,&quot; Raefe answered. &quot;I try to avoid snakes.&quot;
&quot;Would if I could. But a snake every once in a while is worth it to me. No Voice out there, can't wear one of those little eyeball puters either. They don't trust us not to make side deals, and besides, we have to dive a bit sometimes and they ain't gonna spring for underwater puters and all that gear. So no data bots tracking my every move, counting my every second of work, no AI reminding me that I'm 17% behind the baseline productivity rate of my fellow workers. I tried office work in Brazil – not for me.&quot;
&quot;Doesn't it get lonely?&quot; Raefe wondered.
&quot;Too busy to worry about it during the day, and the camps are OK at night. One thing, we always got fresh fish for dinner. Lot of 'cane harvesters are Carib, they always got a jam going on. I teach 'em a little supersamba, it's all good. The company looks the other way what we smoke, how we sleep. This is the end of the season though, my last gig until after the hurricanes start up again.&quot;
He turned his head toward the window, as if to say, conversation over. A few minutes later, he was snoring. 
That was about as much as Raefe had ever heard Lina talk about life in Efricar. 
&quot;So, is that how your dad got to Africa -- Chinese corpos?&quot;
&quot;Not exactly. The Chinese government  went first. The rounded up all the drifters, and the ones that had drifted further from being respectable citizens into piracy or kidnapping. Nothing was working down there -- no farming, no factories, no tourists, no rain, no luck. People did anything they could to get money. The Chinese announced they were all terrorists, shot a few thousand of them, and then signed the rest up to do all the dangerous bits of building their ports and fish farms, and mines.&quot;
&quot;Your dad was an engineer, though, right?&quot; Raefe said.
&quot;Yeah, he worked for the Coastal Friendship Alliance, fancy name for 'we buy the shovels, you dig us a port so our big ships can take everything we pay you next to nothing to make.' But he messed up – he fell in love with my brown mother. At that time, the New Kingdom Party was running China, only the golden need apply. They had no problem with a little chocolate sauce on the side, but no diluting the genes.  So their wedding present to him was a reassignment from head engineer to work crew boss on a massive swamp-clearing project. That's like being the warden of a lunar penal colony. You got a nicer bed than the inmates, but otherwise, you're just as fucked.&quot;
&quot;Is that why your folks left?&quot;
&quot;That's a long story. Basically, the carb economy tanked and that set off a chain reaction when people found out their money was worthless. Riots led to repression, repression led to civil war, civil war led to the bombings and the holocaust. At some point, my dad had to choose a side, and he took me and my mom and we fled to Sofricar when I was 10. I can't remember all that much.&quot;
Or don't want to, he thought. He wanted to ask her about the scar, but bit his tongue. Best thing with Lina was to wait until she ready. She'd just put her suit of armor on otherwise.

            <Text>Three nights later, Salmerikon came to her quarters. She reshaped the entrance room, and an extra chair extended from the floor.
&quot;I've been waiting to ask you what the galaxy was going on at the last ambassador's meeting,&quot; she said.
&quot;'What the galaxy?'&quot; he smiled.
&quot;Oh sorry. I got that from the People, sort of. When they feel strongly about something, they invoke grand forces of nature or their deities. They say things like &quot;what on earth&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; is going on. I guess in my own mind, I've started saying &quot;what the galaxy&quot; since the galaxy is kind of our world, if you want to look at it that way. It just made me realize that even though they can only communicate consciously through words, there is a richness to their expression that I like.&quot;
&quot;You realize that the distinction between Earth and Hell alone underlies millions of deaths on their world?&quot;
&quot;Indeed. But both words also represent their desire to find a connection not only to each other, but to something bigger than themselves. And that is strong in most of them. Some of them have amplified predator tendencies, more like the solitary hunter species that wander the ruined star clusters of Perseus. But in most of them, that solitary instinct is subordinate to their ancestral habits of large bands, and bands of bands. They are always at war with themselves, and so they are often at war with each other. Sorry, you didn't come for a lecture, I suppose. I just get lost in them sometimes.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Not to worry, your passion refreshes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot;
&quot;Yes, in a little while. I need to tell you some things, though, about the ambassadors. And then also about us.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Nothing bad, I hope.&quot; He must know that her passion was not just for the People.
&quot;Yes and no. You know that Anatope and Hanakori have been increasingly vocal about your missions. Not just yours, either.&quot;
&quot;I'm not sure it's a relief to know it's not just me.&quot;
&quot;No, it's not. Increasingly, I suspect that they have doubts about our Guardian role. This is not new among us, of course. Or even undesirable.&quot;
&quot;Doubt is the rock that purifies the water as it flows down the cliff.&quot;
&quot;Yes,’ he smiled at the old proverb. “But I am concerned that they don't share their true doubts, nor the fullness of their thoughts.&quot;
This was more serious than she had imagined. &quot;That is…unfortunate. What will you do?&quot;
&quot;Nothing for now. I have shared my concerns with other pod leaders as well, and for now, we are just listening to understand what Hankori's bunch is up to.&quot;
&quot;Well, let's hope it dissipates.” In her concern, she had unconsciously darkened the room. She brought up warm colors on the walls before Salmerikon noticed. “So what did you want to talk about as far as we are concerned?&quot; She was trying to mask her apprehensiveness, and failing.
&quot;Oh, nothing bad. Can I take you up on that offer of food now?&quot;
She was cheered that he had chosen to eat with her. It had been thousands of years since their kind had needed to deliberately eat to survive. Their ancestors had enhanced them with a variety of autotrophic mechanisms. As long as there was any kind of ambient electromagnetic energy, they were fine. And they could survive for days on gravity alone, in the rare event they were cut off from light or other electro-magnetic radiation. Eating was now for pleasure or companionship, for honoring the ancient voices that still spoke in their cells.
She brought out some purple fruit slices, and some dried meats with microherbal implants. She thought the codes that activated them, releasing the fresh tastes of the herbs into the  meat. What the galaxy, she thought, and brought out a wine she knew he especially liked.
They ate in silence, passing back and forth the wave function of their taste sensations, washing each other's minds in a bath of taste and aroma and texture. When they were done, he grasped both of her hands.
&quot;You always know how to cleanse my mind, Aleron.&quot;
&quot;I'm pleased you feel that way.&quot; She waited for him to speak.
&quot;Do you know how long I have been pod leader?&quot;
&quot;Since before I became an ambassador.&quot;
&quot;It's been more than eleven centuries.&quot;
Ah, now she understood. &quot;You will transform soon?&quot;
&quot;Not soon, but not long either. Before this century is out, I will change to a female.&quot;
&quot;You think we cannot be lovers then?&quot;
&quot;Who knows? Our hearts will go whichever way they want. Either way, we will be friends. But that is not what I wanted to talk about. It has been a long time since I fathered a child, and it would mean a great deal to me if you would join with me for that. It will be a long time into the future before I mother my own child, and I don’t want to wait that long to be a parent again.&quot;
In only her sixth century, she had never thought much about birthing a child. Salmerikon was her first lover who had even passed into parent status.
Later that night, after they had made love in their usual way, Salmerikon guided her in coupling to begin the creation process. In the next few weeks, he would nurture the egg he had fertilized and received from her. His body, with its enhanced nano gene repair tech, would remove any mistakes, correct any serious diseases, build an energy transfer layer around it and wrap it in a protective gel.
When it was done, he would return to her, and they would finish the ancient ritual of transferring the embryo to her. Then her body would take over, and grow it until it was ready to be born. The time spent in both their bodies would allow the baby to immediately join their wave function, and its connection with them would pave its entrance into their community.
She knew that there would be pain and discomfort involved for both of them. Long ago, her species had tried to abolish all that by raising children outside the body. They learned the hard way that evolution had embedded in them the physicality of creation and birth. Both for the parents and the child, there were so many unforeseen and undesirable consequences to losing that experience. So they had contented themselves with merely making it safe.
In the early morning hours, they smiled and sang the first songs of new parents-to-be together. To feel such a chorus for the first time was an experience worth a little discomfort.</Text>

            <Text>Ferry across the Mersey
Claire had pulled down a side road into an old abandoned barn. She opened the back door.
“Right, your with me,” she said, pointing to Raefe.
They pulled back on the main road. The snows hadn’t reached here yet, but the traffic was very light.
“Where are the other two trucks?” he asked.
“Gone different routes,” she said. “Better that way, draws less attention. No reason for three trucks to be heading away from an emergency.”
He touched her mind lightly. She hadn’t learned to entangle, maybe she never would. He could sense that she was calm, used to dodgey circumstances.
“You really work for the electric company?” he asked.
“When there’s work, yeah. Northern England’s a bit of a part time affair, you know.”
“The company or the country?” he asked.
“Bit of both,” she laughed. “But the company, mostly. McDornish’s obsession with power doesn’t always extend to electric power. Can’t be bothered with how the plebes live, most of the time, despite all the yammering. He makes a show of it now and then, and you never hear the end of it. But day to day, he’s more worried about fending off the corpos down South.”
“My impression, too. But you’re from Scotland?”
“Aye, born and raised. Me dad was a tidal power engineer in Sofricar. During the civil war there, he went to Scotland to catch on at one of the island power stations. He met me mom there — she was a clerk up from Glasgow to do the accounting and such.”
“So you grew up on one of those remote little islands?”
“Was born there, but they went back to Glasgow after a hurricane wrecked the plant. Was hard times for them, and me, in the rough part of Glasgow.”
“And from Glasgow to Newcastle?” he asked.
“Bad judgment.”
“How so?”
“Let’s just say I let a bad situation get to me. I never felt at home in Glasgow. Even though eyes closed they couldn’t tell me from a snow white highlander, people still would ask me where I was from. Ask any black Scot, you’ll hear the same. Some go all the way back hundreds of years there, too, but no mind. Even the posh ones. Never had our own tartan, I guess.”
“No better in Northern England, is it?”
“Worse. But I was fooled by all that talk when the Northern Brigades rebelled against the City in ‘63. They sounded like proper revolutionaries to me, out with the old and all that. Soon as I was done with school, I headed there. Sounded good. Was good, for a little while. Then it was, the North for Northerners, even if half of them are Hindus now. And I was back to where was you born? Maybe if I was a little lighter and had a different face, I could have passed for a Hindu, but they saw me and I was nothing but an African here to take what jobs they still had.”
“Strange, isn’t it?,” he said. “There was no one here at all thousands of years ago — The whole place was a hundred feet of solid ice. Like maybe Scotland will be hundreds of years from now, the way things are going. Everyone came here from somewhere else. And it’s just a shouting match about who’s here the longest, who’s the true Brits and so on. America’s the same — the only true Americans are mostly gone and everyone else thinks a few generations qualifies them to keep anyone new out.”
“Indeed. You think it will ever change?”
“Has to,” he said. “Change or die, those are the choices.”
“But how? I see these blokes risk their lives for McDornish and his bunch. And all they get out of it is what they call Northern Pride. How do you fight that?”
“Anyway we can,” he said. “Any way we can get people to see that we can only survive the world we’ve made by banding together and making it right again. Human pride.”
“But what’s your plan? We’re risking our lives to get you South. When we get you there, what will you do to make me feel I risked my life for a good reason?”
“You already answered that. You’ve been risking your life for years, just trying to walk down the street. There is no God or Jesus or Vishnu or whomever who is going to lead us out of this wilderness. There’s just us. And there’s a lot of us, most of us, even, everywhere. Many ideas about the future. We’ll all figure it out, bit by bit. It will take generations, but there’s not time to waste.”
He could see that she wasn’t persuaded.
“You want me to tell you that if we do such and such, in a few years, this will all be over and life will be great?”
“That would be nice,” she said. “You think I’m stupid to want that?”
“To want that?” he said. “No, who wouldn’t want that? To believe that there’s a shortcut to that, that might be stupid. Your parent’s country, they fought for four or five generations just to get the right for a black person to sit next to a white person in public. We have a whole world to change.”
“What makes you think we’ll do better than my father’s country?”
“Actually, they took some of the first steps on the road we’re on, letting the old oppressors own up to their sins and then accepting them back into society. Take McDornish’s gang — say we kill all of them. But they have families, friends who then will hate us and we’ll never end that cycle of victor and vanquished. Most of them are no different than this lot — people with their backs up against it.”
“I’m not like them,” she said, her face cloudy with anger.
“No, you’re not,” he said. “Now. But like you said, they seemed righteous when they started. But they forgot something.”
“What?”
“That the point of fighting is not destroying your opponent. It’s changing what made you need to fight. It’s finding the connection that binds, not cleaves.”.
She didn’t answer. He could feel she was weighing it. She wouldn’t make up her mind just yet, but he had given her something to think about. He noticed the traffic in the other direction was starting to pick up. Their side was still nearly empty.
“Where are they all from?”
“Manchester,” she said. “Most are going as far south as they can, down toward Birmingham, hoping the Republic of South England will let them in. They’re betting the storm won’t get that far. This lot, they’re not betting on that. Maybe they were part of the Troubles, or what not. They’re heading to Hull, take the hover to Rotterdam or Bruges. We thought of that, but too many cops and soldiers. Even without you, the Urban Gypsies are unwelcome pretty much everywhere.”
He watched the cars creeping down the road. He noticed now they were all loaded up, things tied to the roof, trunks half open. After more than a thousand years, the Britons were reversing the voyages that brought them here. And what would they find in Europe? Safety or more frozen death?
“Do  children play the game of musical chairs here?”
“Yes,” she smiled. 
“Life cannot just be a game of musical chairs, don’t you think? People didn’t struggle for thousands of years to make a better life just to turn it into a game of winners and losers, more and more losing until there’s just a few places to sit.”
“But that’s human nature, isn’t it?”
“Ah, but which human nature? The human nature of the first people who figured out how to make a fire, or a bow and arrow, and showed everyone else how to do it, gladly and for free? Or the human nature of the drug corpos, who get uni students to discover life saving drugs for next to nothing, than want to patent them so only those who can pay can have it? What we call human nature isn’t really natural. You can’t find any other animals that are willing to kill half of their own kind.”
“So back to nature, is it? A dogs life. I didn’t have you figured for a back to nature type. More like one of them teachers at the uni, what I heard.”
He smiled. “Maybe I think we should go forward to nature, not back. I just feel it in people, that they could live without fear and hatred and violence, we have it in us, but we’re trapped in dance we can’t figure out how to stop. I just want us to give it a go, to try, before we finally top ourselves as a species.”
“Yeah, okay, I can respect that. Still, you might need a hard girl like me along the way, right?” she said, grinning at him.
“Yeah, probably,” he laughed. “Then we’ll have to figure out how to soften you up.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Raefe shares his growing unease with Lina. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Wired for thought
Cambridge
January 20, 2099
Raefe lay back on his bed, glad the day was over. At the last minute, New Kendall had agreed to contribute building materials from the Dalton teardown to the bus yard and to talk further about mutual aid. It was a big show — he had offered them a place to dump the materials they were pulling out of Dalton Tower without paying all sorts of hauling fees that other areas would demand. So of course they would agree to that. But first they had to show Everywhere couldn’t dictate to them. And officially, they dismissed any talk of disciplining their own. None of Everywhere’s business. He doubted anyone would ever see Sindh in uniform again, but no one would admit he had been fired. 
Still, it could have been worse. The Norcambs were grudgingly satisfied — Ines was no longer threatening mayhem. Everywhere was taking part in the memorials for the dead, agreeing to help their families and the wounded. All in all, it felt like everyone south of the Alewife had come closer over this, and had averted a military slaughter at New Kendall’s hands. For now.
He wanted to feel good about it. He had had many worse days and some much better ones, but these in-between days tended to grind him down the most. Maybe it was the down side of empathy. We always wanted to convert empathy to sympathy. Knowing what someone thought and why was a gift. But it came with a price — the tension that built inside him when he knew he disagreed with their actions and intentions. On his worst days, it became a spiral of self-doubt.
He wasn’t there yet, but he felt himself slipping towards it. He missed Lina and Nyssa and Des. He missed the closeness they had in the years just after they had defeated Billy Warren’s insane plan to go underground for 1,000 years while the world burned. Those were great times, for them, for Everywhere. Even for the Guardians, who seemed like a distant memory now. Warren’s twisted Guardian handler, Hankori, had been stymied by Diver and Far Flier and Adno, but Hankori was still in charge and Raefe’s Guardian mentors seemed to be lying low. Earth was on its own now.
The hopefulness of 2081 hadn’t lasted that long. After the Thwaites Glacier had taken a swan dive into the Antarctic Ocean in 2088, sea levels had risen rapidly all around the globe. That had triggered some additional ice sheet loss. All humanity was overwhelmed with the consequences — the destruction of entire cities, countries. Hundreds of millions of the displaced and dispossessed were on the move. More than ever, Everywhere was needed. Raefe’s family was torn by so many different demands. Lina had stayed in Africa, Nyssa had gone to India, Des to Europe. He had come home, although the TechTown neighborhood he had once spent all of his time in was now a deserted marsh.
When he had arrived back ten years ago, he had dreamed of North America becoming a vast network of tanglers. He would help forge the backbone of the new world they all wanted to build. Their empathy would spill over, bathing everyone in it, and the rest would slowly grow into the network, like children learning to speak. Lina, Des, Nyssa — they had similar dreams, too.
 But nothing had worked quite so well as they had hoped. They had made great progress. Everywhere now had nearly a billion citizens, scattered to every corner of the world. And maybe that was part of the problem. Outside of a band stretching from Nigeria to Kenya, they had only managed to form small islands, or just small clumps, dissolved into the broader chaos and downward slide of civilization. People pinned so much hope on them, and they had to constantly explain that they were not saviors, they had no magic. Humanity had generations of hard work ahead to survive. Raefe would never see the day when humanity could say it had survived this crisis of its own making, but he lived in fear of seeing the day when it failed. That was a real possibility.
And that fear had made the long grind so hard. It had worn all of them down, most of all him. And it had become a wedge between him and Lina. After 50 years, their bond was still strong, but it felt unreal on days like this. He hadn’t seen her for three years, hadn’t seen the kids for five. Tonight he wished he was back in Dadaab, under the African stars, with his so-smart young kids and the woman he loved.
“I am here,” Lina said, her thoughts suddenly warm in his mind. He felt Des and Nyssa, too.
Lina could feel his weariness. “I should have made sure you were safe after the storm,” she said. “Sorry. Just now I felt your sadness across the waveform. How bad are things there?”
“Depends on how you want to measure it,” he said. “Probably about 100 people were killed in the flooding. Four people were shot by New Kendall for trying to cross into their territory. Maybe 1,000 new homeless people. On the plus side, food and water still available, and our supply lines are intact.”
Nyssa knew  that when her father recited statistics, he was not speaking from his deepest mind. She felt the contours of his sadness, what was really bothering him.
“And still, people are fighting each other, eh?” she said.
Raefe smiled. “Daughter whom I cannot hide my thoughts from, exactly right. I’ve had to negotiate with the corpos to prevent the most downtrodden from trying to kill them.”
“Just like Newcastle in the old days,” Lina said. She had been so proud of how he had brought the Urban Gypsies into the fold. They had been a street gang with aspirations for something more, and he had won their hearts. He had taught them how to entangle and showed them that empathy worked. She wished he would remember his successes more when things weren’t going well.
“You are right, Lina,” he said. “Sometimes what we do works. We think about how fast the glaciers melt. We need to remember that it took tens of thousands of years to make them. But we are not built for that, I fear.”
“Oh, dad,” Des said. “That’s the beauty of us. We are not just built — we make ourselves. Surely, we weren’t built to live in mega cities or fly planes or walk on Mars. Yet we have done all of those things.”
Nyssa stopped herself from reminding him that these technical accomplishments were part of the problem, this belief in always external solutions to every problem. That was an argument to be had in the tech districts she sometimes worked in, where those were articles of faith and sources of wealth, always a deadly combination in human history. She knew deep down that Des knew that. It was just that if she and mom and dad lived at the street level in the here and now, Des lived at 50,000 feet and 500 years.
“I think what dad means,” she said, “is that we are always in this race against time.”
Lina shared a memory of herself as a teenager, lacing up her track shoes, nervously pacing the start line for a 400 meter race. The feel of running free, then seeing another girl in front, straining to reach her, seeing the finish line around the last bend, trying to find that burst to overtake her. And the joy when her breathing, her legs, her whole being joined and the track felt like nothing as she surged forward above it.
“Yes, like that,” Raefe said. “Only in super slow motion.” He had never been athletic. It was interesting to know what it was like to feel competitive drive. It wasn’t all about beating the other runner. There was a piece that was not wanting to disappoint yourself, to do what you knew, or at least hoped, you were capable of. And also, he realized, an animal joy at the all-out effort, the feeling of exploding forwards.  “Only this isn’t about a trophy. So much is at stake.”
“It’s a huge world, dad,” Des said. “We’re just such a small part. We can only ever be that. I try to remember that our job is to be the best part of the whole, not some 20th century idea of a hero.”
“Yes, well, we need better parts and more of them,” Raefe said. “But that’s interesting about the hero. Maybe I do get confused there. I’m a 21st century guy, for sure, but my parents, the culture I was raised in. Still a lot of that superhero stuff in the vids and so on. It’s almost the 22nd century. What will a 22nd century hero look like?”
“That’s why people love you,” Lina said. “Because you ask them to think about things like that, to be something new, yes, but something that they are capable of,  something they have inside them.”
“Well, thanks to you all for the pep talk,” he said. “My doubts must have been strong to have rippled the waveform all around the world.”
“Just all around our world,” Lina said. “You are always in our thoughts. I know you doubt that sometimes and we all have similar doubts. But I still feel that however long it takes, we will get there. Diver as much as told us that.” But she knew what was really bothering him, what he couldn’t bring himself to say, for fear that it would demoralize them. He had come to question whether many humans would ever be empaths. Perhaps people like them were doomed to be freaks surrounded by people for whom empathy was only a dalliance. It was easier to be hopeful in Dadaab, where empathy had a head start over most places. 
“Mom’s right,” Des said. “We all need to remember that we can’t fight for humanity by losing our own. We preach that to people all the time, we need to take time to practice it, too.”
They were quiet, letting their mutual feelings spread like the sun breaking through the clouds, bringing warmth and relief. Raefe felt them gradually withdraw as he began drifting off to sleep, his wounds closing just a bit.</Text>

            <Notes>Raefe, nyssa and des meet with Manfred in Barcelona, now the Catalan Free State. Des and Nyssa together discover they can hack Manfred’s computer enhancements. Manfred tells them the Euro corpos are in turmoil, something big is happening, no one will say what.
Later, Des gets deep into the Daimler Siemens system and he discovers the Armageddon plan. It’s all going to be triggered by computer, so this gives them a way to stop it.
Raefe and Lina convene their summit. They had been focused on the environment and slowly building up man’s empathic abilities but now its clear that the elites won’t give them that luxury of time. They all agree to sabotage the plan by hacking it and then fully publicizing it.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Aleron throws her lot in with Salmerikon</Synopsis>
            <Text>Clearing her mind
June 4, 2049
After her swim with Salmerikon, Aleron had spent several days buried in work. She had wanted to say yes to him on the spot, but mistrusted herself and needed time to think. The conflict with Hankori was ominous and strange. All the same, she had spent considerable hours monitoring Raefe and Lina a Dadaab, and things there were going better than she had expected.
The Guardians had long debated how conscious entanglement had arisen through evolution. After all, Na’Wra had no one to teach her. Nothing in her culture prepared her for it, or even considered it possible. Many scholars had concluded that the survival pressures of extended war had triggered epigenetic changes in her. These same changes enabled her to make them permanent and to instruct her progeny in how to trigger them and keep them from dissolving. Lina’s experiences at Dadaab lent credence to that theory. The emergence of Fatima and Edna as naive entanglers was living proof that certain kinds of stresses could trigger this evolution. Still, the details were murky.
All very interesting if her job was as a researcher, but she was a Guardian ambassador. Most exciting was the convergence of Raefe and Lina’s abilities with the social awareness of Citizens of Nowhere and the alternate economic system of the New Voodo Army. This was the first time in Earth’s history that the prototypical elements had come together that usually helped civilizations escape the Optimization phase and grow into a more sustainable culture. The Guardian archives were full of such flowerings failing. But of the 20 civilizations now in the Guardians, all but one had followed this sort of path.
She would give Salmerikon her answer in a few days, but first, she needed to be sure. It was time for alakh, or thinking sleep. She arranged her room for maximum quiet. She removed herself from all entanglements. Finally she disconnected her enhancements from all communications. She was alone with her thoughts.
She watched the movie of her life as if it were someone else. For more than 100 years, she had been the bright female that everyone liked. She was the person who had energy and promise. But her accomplishments were minor. Despite what Salmerikon said, she was sure that she would never lead the Guardian Council as he had. She was not a pathbreaker.
And yet she realized now that she couldn’t know that. She didn’t know what the future would bring, with or without Salmerikon, with or without the Guardian Council. She couldn’t pretend that her future lay only in that context. It was time to inventory just what she had done.
She had engaged with Raefe and now in only a year or so, had brought him very far down the road to being a significant change agent. She had helped him through his trials with separation, and now he and Lina were a force to be reckoned with. No one had recruited a new civilization to the Guardians in centuries and now she was close to doing just that.
The point wasn’t that she had accomplished this, but that she had surprised herself with her strength, perseverance and skill. These would be her pillars, no matter what she undertook. And she realized that Salmerikon had said these things to her many ways, many times. And now she knew that he was not just acting the teacher, but also the pupil. He needed her.
Not just him. If what he had said was right, the Guardians needed her. Although he was only in his late middle years and not yet old, he had lost hope and strength. Hankori was cunning and she knew he had allies planted in many places. Salmerikon had held Hankori off, but it was only a matter of time before he retreated to a place from which he would no longer be able to stop Hankori in whatever it was he was doing. And she was sure he was up to no good.
Connection, people, life — these were fundamental things she would fight for. These were the things that any future she wanted to be a part of would have to built on. The swirling thoughts in her head had spiraled down to this one clear point. She knew she should emerge from alakh now and walk that path.
It was nearly midnight, but she reached out to Salmerikon. As he made his way to her room, she let him feel her alakh. She opened the door for him.
“We will make a child, and will make a new Guardians,” she said. “I will do this with you.”
She took him wordlessly to her bed. After they had made love, Salmerikon guided her in coupling to begin the creation process. In the next few weeks, he would nurture the egg he had fertilized and received from her. His body, with its enhanced nano gene repair tech, would remove any mistakes, correct any serious diseases, build an energy transfer layer around it and wrap it in a protective gel.
When it was done, he would return to her, and they would perform the ancient ritual of transferring the embryo to her. Then her body would take over, and grow it until it was ready to be born. The time spent in both their bodies would allow the baby to immediately join their wave function, and its connection with them would pave its entrance into the larger community.
She knew that there would be pain and discomfort involved for both of them. Long ago, her species had tried to abolish all that by raising children outside the body. They learned the hard way that evolution had embedded in them the physicality of creation and birth. Both for the parents and the child, there were so many unforeseen and undesirable consequences to losing that experience. So they had contented themselves with merely making it safe.
In the early morning hours, they smiled and sang the first songs of new parents-to-be together. To feel such a chorus for the first time was an experience worth a little discomfort.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Aleron informs the Guardians of Raefe's progress.
Salmerikon visits Aleron. They mate.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 7

The focus shifted to Aleron. She felt the overlapping waves of the committee, the patterns of interest, skepticism, affection, hostility. She let her report flow calmly.
&quot;We've made a breakthrough with the People. We had shifted a promising receptee, Raefe, into a new timeline to prolong his development. That has now paid off – you can see from the memories I have sent you that he is now ready to move into a new stage of social development, completely new for his species.&quot;
She let them feel the contradictions that had developed in Raefe, her sense that he was like a young creature about to crack its protective egg and really see the world for the first time. She let them hear Raefe and Lina, how they were looking for a thoughtstream to join that was not based on anger or despair or self-proclaimed superiority. How they were looking for others with the same potential. What she had seen inside his mind when she had transitioned him to his new timeline.
This was what they Guarded for, these moments of hope that they could build on. But she could also feel opposition in their wave function.
&quot;Since your intervention, this one has thought many things. You should have consulted with us before having an encounter. His fitness is far from certain. He has been very slow to come to this&quot; Hanakori responded.
&quot;It seems slower to us than it does to him,&quot; Aleron replied, acknowledging while contradicting. &quot;The more I entangle with them, the more I see the imbalance between their rational and emotional lives, and the consequent slowness with which they come to grasp new ways.&quot;
&quot;Precisely. And yet they are near the brink again, in his new world. Which makes me wonder why we continue with this Earth,&quot; said Anatope. Aleron was not surprised. He and Hanakori had long been impatient with what they saw as lost causes.
&quot;But they are making progress,&quot; she insisted. &quot;We have seen this before. About 10 of their generations ago, their urbanization process threatened to kill them off in waves of disease. They had no understanding of their own biology. Their medicine was based either on superstition or trial and error. Yet within three generations, they solved the riddle of bacteria, the major threat to them, and have ever since been gradually spreading new practices throughout their societies. And we have other examples. This species seems to work fastest when time is shortest.&quot;
&quot;I don't see it that way,&quot; Hanakori replied. &quot;They are a classic case of a society stuck in the Optimization phase. They have learned much about the physical world, and they are in love with the notion that there is a physical answer to every problem. The only significant agents of progress in their society favor more technology, their opponents less or just different technology.&quot;
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Anatope said. &quot;They have made little progress in understanding their own inner workings and how their minds interact with these changes they are constantly implementing. And what progress they have made seems entirely focused on each individual. From your reports, I see no evidence that they have come to understand in any deep way how their individual natures, small group natures, big group behavior, and species behavior interact. They constantly replicate mistakes of the past, each time with more optimized technology. We know this is the path to self-destruction.&quot;
&quot;Yes, we do,&quot; Aleron agreed. &quot;If it were not true, we would have no mission there. But now we have a catalyst in Raefe, and a few hundred other promising individuals who are only slightly behind him, who are beginning to break through to a new paradigm. We have succeeded with such allies before with other species, many times. The simulations still allow for a reasonable chance of success.  I ask only for patience.&quot;
&quot;You ask for more,&quot; Anatope responded instantly, as if waiting to pounce. &quot;You ask for energy to maintain the entanglement, indeed for more and more to spread it. You ask for more Guardians.&quot;
&quot;I ask what all Guardians have always asked for,&quot; she replied. &quot;That we spend our time and energy as needed to save life and nurture it to sustainability. What better use do we have for our time and energy?&quot;
She was puzzled. Once again she had felt the hard edge of judgment from Anatope's cohort. They often came dangerously close to talking about &quot;worthy&quot; species, an idea she thought the very opposite of what being a Guardian was. It was an old idea that plagued many advanced species, who found it hard to resist looking at intelligent life that was millennia behind them in development as pets, or worse, garden plants, to be tended until they became boring, or worse still, pests to be eliminated. Shedding that notion was one of the key steps to becoming a Guardian species, but it was never shed all at once, or for all time.
But Anatope's bunch had never made an argument based on resources. Why now? Her effort with the People was one of thousands underway by hundreds of Guardians, each of which consumed a relatively small part of the energy they were able to extract from the vacuum. Why pick on her or her project?
Even as she pondered this, she could feel a shift in the wave function.  Salmerikon, always encouraging her, now felt stern. But she could feel Anatope shrink, too, from him.
&quot;We are not here to debate whether we are Guardians,&quot; Salmerikon said flatly. &quot;We are only ambassadors, and we must carry out the will of all of our kind to be Guardians. Anatope, Hanakori, you are free to raise the wisdom of guardianship with the Whole. In the meantime, our choices with any species we are Guarding are limited to how we may help them, not whether. And now I think there are others who have news to report, as well.&quot;
Three nights later, Salmerikon came to her quarters. She reshaped the entrance room, and an extra chair extended from the floor.
&quot;I've been waiting to ask you what the galaxy was going on at the last ambassador's meeting,&quot; she said.
&quot;'What the galaxy?'&quot; he smiled.
&quot;Oh sorry. I got that from the People, sort of. When they feel strongly about something, they invoke grand forces of nature or their deities. They say things like &quot;what on earth&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; is going on. I guess in my own mind, I've started saying &quot;what the galaxy&quot; since the galaxy is kind of our world, if you want to look at it that way. It just made me realize that even though they can only communicate consciously through words, there is a richness to their expression that I like.&quot;
&quot;You realize that the distinction between Earth and Hell alone underlies millions of deaths on their world?&quot;
&quot;Yes, certainly. But both words also represent their desire to find a connection not only to each other, but to something bigger than themselves. And that is strong in most of them. Some of them have amplified predator tendencies, more like the solitary hunter species that wander the ruined star clusters of Perseus. But in most of them, that solitary instinct is subordinate to their ancestral habits of large bands, and bands of bands. Sorry, you didn't come for a lecture, I suppose. I just get lost in them sometimes.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Not to worry, your passion refreshes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot;
&quot;Yes, in a little while. I need to tell you some things, though, about the ambassadors. And then also about us.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Nothing bad, I hope.&quot; He must know that her passion was not just for the People.
&quot;Yes and no. You know that Anatope and Hanakori have been increasingly vocal about your missions. Not just yours, either.&quot;
&quot;I'm not sure it's a relief to know it's not just me.&quot;
&quot;No, it's not. Increasingly, I suspect that they have doubts about our Guardian role. This is not new among us, of course. Or even undesirable.&quot;
&quot;Doubt is the rock that purifies the water as it flows down the cliff.&quot;
&quot;Indeed. But I am concerned that they don't share their true doubts, nor the fullness of their thoughts.&quot;
This was more serious than she had imagined. &quot;That is…unfortunate. What will you do?&quot;
&quot;Nothing for now. I have shared my concerns with other pod leaders as well, and for now, we are just listening to understand what Anatope's cohort is up to.&quot;
&quot;Well, let's hope it dissipates.” In her concern, she had unconsciously darkened the room. She brought up warm colors on the walls before Salmerikon noticed. “So what did you want to talk about as far as we are concerned?&quot; She was trying to mask her apprehensiveness, and failing.
&quot;Oh, nothing bad. Can I take you up on that offer of food now?&quot;
She was cheered that he had chosen to eat with her. It had been thousands of years since their kind had needed to deliberately eat to survive. Their ancestors had enhanced them with a variety of autotrophic mechanisms. As long as there was any kind of ambient electromagnetic energy, they were fine. And they could survive for days on gravity alone, in the rare event they were cut off from light or other electro-magnetic radiation. Eating was now for pleasure or companionship, for honoring the ancient voices that still spoke in their cells.
She brought out some purple fruit slices, and some cheese with microherbal implants. She thought the codes that activated them, releasing the fresh tastes of the herbs into the aged cheese. What the galaxy, she thought, and brought out a wine she knew he especially liked.
They ate in silence, passing back and forth the wave function of their taste sensations, washing each other's minds in a bath of taste and aroma and texture. When they were done, he grasped both of her hands.
&quot;You always know how to cleanse my mind, Aleron.&quot;
&quot;I'm pleased you feel that way.&quot; She waited for him to speak.
&quot;Do you know how long I have been pod leader?&quot;
&quot;Since before I became an ambassador.&quot;
&quot;It's been more than eleven centuries.&quot;
Ah, now she understood. &quot;You will transform soon?&quot;
&quot;Not soon, but not long either. Before this century is out, I will change to a female.&quot;
&quot;You think we cannot be lovers then?&quot;
&quot;Who knows? Our hearts will go whichever way they want. Either way, we will be friends. But that is not what I wanted to talk about. It has been a long time since I fathered a child, and it would mean a great deal to me if you would join with me for that. It will be a long time into the future before I mother my own child, and I don’t want to wait that long to be a parent again.&quot;
In only her sixth century, she had never thought much about birthing a child. Salmerikon was her first lover who had even passed into parent status.
Later that night, after they had made love in their usual way, Salmerikon guided her in coupling to begin the creation process. In the next few weeks, he would nurture the egg he had fertilized and received from her. His body, with its enhanced nano gene repair tech, would remove any mistakes, correct any serious diseases, build an energy transfer layer around it and wrap it in a protective gel.
When it was done, he would return to her, and they would finish the ancient ritual of transferring the embryo to her. Then her body would take over, and grow it until it was ready to be born. The time spent in both their bodies would allow the baby to immediately join their wave function, and its connection with them would pave its entrance into their community.

Both for the parents and the child, there were so many unforeseen and undesirable consequences to losing that experience. So they had contented themselves with merely making it safe.
In the early morning hours, they smiled and sang the first songs of new parents-to-be together. To feel such a chorus for the first time was an experience worth a little discomfort.</Text>

            <Text>How the other half lives
“Manfred, good to see you,” Raefe said, shaking his hand. “I appreciate you putting yourself out like this.”
“Happy to help,” Manfred said. “You and Lina were always good to me.”
“Nice of you to say,” Raefe said. “I think maybe we were a little rough on you as a teenager.”
“Ah, fathers and daughters,” Manfred said. “I have an eight-year old girl now. I’ll probably be the same in a few years. No hard feelings. Anyway, this is all about much bigger things.”
That’s how they do it, Raefe thought. They think there are bigger things than children, because they only think of their child. They’ve lost the ability to think about all children, all people.
“Not such big things, but yes, we have some serious matters to discuss. Myself and a companion need to be able to travel in South England for a few days, and then depart without being noticed. What do you advise?”
“Let me check the security situation.”
Manfred had certainly come up in the world, Raefe thought, from the ragged boy in the NVA settlement. He was wearing a slate blue onesie in some exotic technical fabric with shortsleeves  and legs that stopped fashionably just below the calves. Did it have an integral puter? Raefe couldn’t see any ear—mounted eyepiece like everyone else used. 
“Your suit a puter too?” he asked.
“No,” Manfred said, embarassed. “UFS gives us implants. We subvoc to use it. Mandatory for employees above a certain rank.”
“Well, it was just a matter of time.”
“And money,” Manfred said. “Always that. Anyway, right now South England security forces are most focused on the northern border — keeping fugees out who have no relatives, jobs or other legit reason to cross. Southern borders are much more relaxed. Internally, London is still your best bet. With 20 million people, they can’t watch everyone. Stay out of Central and The City — they’re closed off to anyone under Level 10 or their certified employees. Too difficult to make that work. South London’s your best bet, but it’s tricky. Barking’s all white, you could blend in there.”
“No, that won’t work for my friend.”
“Maybe Bromley then. Every sort there. Not dangerous, mostly Level 6ish. Low level managers, a few crafts types and so on. Can you fake that?”
“Water engineer? Software team leader? Teacher? That sort of thing”
“Teach and engineer, no that’s Level 4 and 5 type stuff. A little downmarket. Is your companion female? She could be your wife, be an individual contributor. Especially if she’s younger. Team leader, that’s the right stuff.”
“Okay, I can still talk that talk.”
“Alright, you’re now Tom and Cecille Morgan and you’ve been transferred to the London offices of DigiBrand, your old company from many years ago. You should find a housing complex for new arrivals — New Opportunity Housing is the official designation. Perfectly normal, as it can take a year or more to find permanent housing in London. All South England citizens have numbered identity accounts. I’ve emailed yours to the account you set up for us to communicate, along with your stage 1 password. That will work for most everything except direct contact with the state — they do DNA scans. It’ll take the week to set that up so that you can pass exit at Customs, so until then avoid being picked up by the coppers.”
“What else?”
“There’s no cash in South England, so you’ll have to use your puter to pay for everything. I’ve set up 5,000 credit accounts for both of you, but you can’t pay for anything over 500 credits without DNA authentication. In the countryside, that’s no problem. In Bromley, you’ll have to stick to the New Opps hotels near the train stations — you can find ones that cater to people not anxious to be found that will let you pay in advance each day to keep the total down. The area around the North Station in Bromley is best for that.”
“Just curious, but why would a solid citizen Level 6 not want to be found?”
“Nothing serious — late on paying the bills, that sort of thing.”
“And how confident are you that we’ll go undetected?”
“Quite. Without going into too much detail, the group I work in at UFS does this sort of thing routinely. It can all be traced back to my boss, but not me. It won’t be though — the security forces know not to poke into what UFS is doing.”
“Well, very much appreciated, Manfred.”
“Sure,” he said, his expression now pained. “Nyssa probably told you my situation. When I came here, I thought they would all be these bright shiney corpos who were going to rebuild the world and we’d all get rich doing it. They’re monsters, though. Those people in North England? Thousands of them are going to die if they don’t get south. Give them some park in Wales, for God’s sake. It’s not like they were going to move into Central and all the executives were going to have to sleep in bunk beds.”
“Millions, probably,” Raefe said. “The ice may never leave. If the people don’t, millions will die. You know that they don’t want to rebuild the world, right? They would be very happy ruling a world with a billion people, if that’s what it came to.”
“I’m coming to that realization,” Manfred said. “But I don’t see it changing. They have a lot of power and even more money.”
“Topic for another day. Don’t give up on the Free. They do want to rebuild the world, like you do. Just in a different way. So keep your eyes open, and thanks again.”
“Right,” Manfred said. “But before you go, there’s something you should know. It’s not just your lot that’s banding together. Corpos like UFS, they’re starting to band together, too. In March, there’s going to be a top secret summit of the world’s biggest corpos. Mostly what to do about the shrinking land mass and the horrible weather. But your lot’s on the agenda, too. So keep your eyes open, too.”
He got the all clear from Claire and walked back through the Tunnels. The street was still deserted, the Peach the only car in sight.
“Mrs. Cecille Morgan, so nice to of you to pick up your husband Tom. Fancy a drive to Bromley?”
“Why, yes, Mr. Tom, I believe I do.”</Text>

            <Text>Do North
Radisson, Quebec
April, 2099

Mik and Nila had left Val D’Or the day before, hitching a ride on a truck bringing food north through ever sparser country to Radisson, on the banks of the La Grande River. Most of the day, they could have been traveling through the same place any time in the last 10,000 years and seen the same view, nearly devoid of human imprint. But as they had come around the last bend into Radisson, suddenly they were in a bustling town, horns honking, traffic lights, streets full of people.
They hoisted their packs and found their way to the address they had been given back home. It was on a side street off the main drag, a plain little house with nothing more than a house number to identify it. They knocked, half worrying they had the wrong address, or the wrong city even. A small woman with pulled back straight hair, streaked with gray, answered the door.
“Hi, we’re Nila and Mik from Boston,” Nila said. “We’re on our way to Thunberg and we were told to come here.”
“Come on in. I’m Noreen Cheechoo and you’re in the right place,” she said. She showed them to a room in the back where they could bunk overnight. They sat in the front room while she made tea.
“So, you’re the kids from New Kendall, eh?” Noreen said.
“From, as in left it, not of it,” Mik said. “If you get my drift.”
Noreen laughed. “Oh yeah, I figured that. New Kendall would be more likely to send armed drones then two kids. Tell me what brings you here.”
“How much do you know about New Kendall?” Nila asked. “I mean, everyone knows about the company, but we live in the town.”
“Well, you’re right, I know about the company — they really make sure everyone knows them, don’t they? What’s the town like?”
“Where to start?” Nila said. “Let’s just say it’s a weird place. It’s a gated community, basically, where all the corpos and the few thousand  people who run the company live. The best thing about it is it’s high and dry, which is not so easy on the East Coast of North America these days.”
“And the worst thing about it,” Mik jumped in, “is that they’ll do anything to keep everyone else out, even if they have to shoot them. And I don’t mean people from the other side of the world, not that that’s right either, but they’ll shoot people on the other side of the river who try to come over to high ground during storms when the river floods.”
“So we just finished high school,” Nila said, “and in New Kendall that means they assign you to a job, whether you want that job or not. And we just don’t want to be part of their whole messed up corpo thing. We read up on a lot of different stuff and we really like the whole idea of Thunberg. We want to be part of that.”
“It’s not a vacation, you know,” Noreen said. “It might be more than you’re ready for as far as hard work goes. Ever dug a ditch, or worked a farm?”
“No,” Mik said. “But we’re not afraid of that. We’re young, healthy, we figure it’ll take a bit, but we should be just as able to do that as anyone else. Right?”
“Yeah, just that,” Nila said. “We know we’re soft and we have a lot to learn. That’s why we want to be part of it.”
“Well, you’ve got the right attitude,” Noreen said. “I’m gonna tell you straight up, with people from these corpo fortresses, we’ve learned we have to be real careful. Not everyone is who they say they are. So in a little while, a nurse is going to come and she’s going to verify some stuff about you. She’ll take DNA, she’ll scan you for implants, stuff like that. Are you good with that?”
They looked at each other. Heaven had bouncers, it seemed. Nila felt Mik’s agreement. She nodded for the both of them.
“Ok, I’ll let her know,” Noreen said. “While we’re waiting, would you like some tea?”
She brought them some kind of herbal tea.
“This is good,” Mik said. “What kind is it?”
“Local stuff, some herbs and some moss,” Noreen said. “People have been drinking that here for thousands of years.”
“Are you First Nations?” Nila asked.
“Yes, Wakaganish Cree,” Noreen said. “Born and raised not far from here. Back when no one wanted the land. Better to give us this then Montreal, I guess was how they looked at it a century ago. Now some of them want it back, or they want to shit all over it just like they did in the south.”
“Yeah, it looks like a mall parking lot before Christmas out there on Main Street,” Mik said. “We thought it was going to be more different.”
“Oh, don’t worry, Thunberg is not like anywhere you’ve been. And most of these jokers here couldn’t even find it with a map. I’ll take you there in the morning, though.”
“That’s a relief,” Nila said. “Still, it’s sad that people are wrecking this place. If they want to live unsustainably, why don’t they just stay where they were?”
“Well, that’s a good question,” Noreen said. “I don’t want to be too harsh. Some of them, there’s no there anymore where they were — it’s underwater, it’s desert, there’s no more drinking water, well, you know all of that. Most of them, really, that’s their story. But then there’s also the ones that want to be the next Ken Robertson, if you know what I mean.”
“Oh, yeah, we know exactly what you mean,” Nila said. “But about the others, the fugees, it’s a bit surprising that they’re crapping up the place. Back home, the fugees and the corpos hate each other. Some of the fugees are amazing. You know about REM?”
“Sure, who doesn’t?” Noreen said. “We’re in touch with Everywhere. But like everything else, some people learn, some people don’t. And it seems like the fugees who don’t learn come to places like Hudson Bay because they think it’s their time to get their piece of the almighty pie. So just be careful here — not everyone is a saint, or even just a nice person.”
There was a knock on the door and a young woman with a medical bag came in. Noreen introduced her as Kaitlyn. Also short, compact, she worked quickly taking blood and saliva that went into a small machine for analysis. She slowly passed a short wand from head to toe over each of them.
“Ok, no implants, so we know you’re not wired for sound,” Kaitlyn said. “Now I’m going to take the data from your samples and check them against your New Kendall health records.”
“You can do that?” Mik said.
“Don’t worry,” Kaitlyn said, cracking a smile for the first time. “They’ll never know about it, so they can’t backtrack you to here. Let’s just say we have modernized our hunting and fishing skills to include data. Here we go — Mik Albertson, son of Tyfnie and Ray-Juan and Nila Edwards, daughter of…hey, what the fuck? Did you think you’d get away with this?”
“What?” Nila said. “What’s the problem?” She was too startled to try and read Kaitlyn’s emotions.
“Tell me who your parents are,” Kaitlyn said.
“My mom is Lillith Edwards. I don’t know who my dad is. I never met him and she never told me.”
“Listen, we have a problem,” Noreen said, looking at the puter over Kaitlyn’s shoulder. “Your mother is secret police for New Kendall and your dad is, well let’s just say he’s a problem.”
“I know my mom’s a Sec, but that’s partly why I’m here, to get away from her and her awful corpo boyfriend — not my father — who does even worse stuff. You’re going to bounce me for that?”
“No, we’re not going to turn you away, not just yet,” Noreen said. “But we need to be sure. There’s an easy way for us to solve this.”
Nila felt Noreen’s mind brush up against her. “You want to tangle with me?”
“Well, it would be Kaitlyn, and it would be both of you. Are you OK with that?”
“Mik, are you OK with that?” Nila asked. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Just like when you tried it with me, right?” Mik asked.
“How deep did you go?” Kaitlyn asked Nila.
“I don’t know, he’s like the only person I ever did it with, except, actually, REM himself. Long story — you can have the memory if you don’t believe me. But I’m not like some big expert tangler.”
“Show me how you did it with him,” Kaitlyn said, point at Mik. “ But use that to show me the memory of Raefe.”
Nila took a deep breath and tried to calm the rising panic. They had come more than a thousand miles to the edge of the world to start anew, and yet they couldn’t escape the very thing they had fled. She felt Kaitlyn’s mind, open but not all the way, like a road with fences on either side. She found an opening in the fence and let her mind walk through it. She had entered a room with calming, dull red walls. It felt warm and welcoming. She relaxed and recalled sitting outside the office in New Kendall, connecting with Raefe on the other side of the wall, listening to the meeting through him.
“Thanks,” Kaitlyn said. “You are stronger than you think. I won’t  need to go deeper than that with you, Mik.”
Mik nodded. “Go ahead.”
Nila was already tangled with Mik. She could feel Kaitlyn enter his mind. It was weird to witness someone else this. She couldn’t tell what Kaitlyn found, but she withdrew. Nila felt Kaitlyn connect with Noreen. She was telling her what she had learned, that Mik was clean, that Nila was complicated but not here under false pretenses. Her mother was a Sec and her father was not in their picture anymore.
And then Nila knew who her father was. And why her mother had never told her. And she wanted to vomit and scream and punch a hole in the wall all at the same time.
“Are you, OK?” Mik asked. “You look pale.”
Kaitlyn’s face softened. “I’m so sorry. I should have realized you would sense what I shared with Noreen. You shouldn’t have had to learn about it that way.”
“Learn what?” Mik asked.
“Nothing!” Nila said, struggling to keep it together. “I’ll tell you later. Are we done now? Are you going to let us stay or did we come all this way for nothing?”
“We’re good,” Noreen said. “But we had to know that you weren’t here to fuck things up. You wouldn’t have been the first. I’m sorry it went down this way, but we really had no choice.”
*****
Later, Noreen made them a dinner of salmon from the Bay, with some local turnipy kind of root and some big fat tomatoes from her garden. Even without tangling, Nila could tell Noreen was trying to be kind, feeling bad about the afternoon’s shocking revelation. That was still banging around in Nila’s head and she couldn’t make it settle down. She had left home, but home hadn’t left her, not just yet. She permitted herself to think about it more while they helped Noreen clean up, but it was still too big and raw to get a bead on it. She had no idea of what to do with this new information. Was there really anything to do?
Mik was geared up to go out on the town. She thought he was looking to get silly after being cooped up in New Kendall, with its strict limits on drugs and alcohol. She agreed to go with him to investigate the local brews in the town’s many bars. Once they were out of Noreen’s earshot, he couldn’t contain himself.
“So who’s your old man?” he said, as if maybe her dad were some famous vid star or footy player.
“No one you’d want to know,” she said.
“Oh, sorry,” he said. “Did you know him?”
“Not personally,” she said, “but yea, I know who he is. It’s not just who he is, though…”
“What?”
“It’s also the circumstances…”
“The circumstances?”
“Listen, I’m not ready for this, OK,” she said. “It’s put my mom, my whole life, in a different light. I have to think about this.”
“Ok, I’ll let it go. But you’re not having second thoughts about this, are you?”
“No, no, if anything, I’m even more convinced this was the right thing to do. The farther away as I can get from her, from them, the better off I’ll be.”
“Good. If you want to talk about it, let me know.”
“Yeah, thanks. Now, let’s get fucked up.”

            <Text>Light conversation
At night, after the council meeting, Salmerikon came to her quarters. Aleron reshaped the entrance room, and an extra chair extended from the floor.
&quot;I've been waiting to ask you what the galaxy was going on at the last ambassador's meeting,&quot; she said.
&quot;'What the galaxy?'&quot; he smiled.
&quot;Oh sorry. I got that from humans, sort of. When they feel strongly about something, they invoke grand forces of nature or their deities. They say things like &quot;what on earth&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; is going on. I guess in my own mind, I've started saying &quot;what the galaxy&quot; since the galaxy is kind of our world, if you want to look at it that way. It just made me realize that even though they can only communicate consciously through words, there is a richness to their expression that I like.&quot;
&quot;You realize that the distinction between Earth and Hell alone underlies millions of deaths on their world?&quot;
&quot;Indeed. But both words also represent their desire to find a connection not only to each other, but to something bigger than themselves. And that is strong in most of them. Some of them have amplified predator tendencies, more like the solitary hunter species that wander the ruined star clusters of Perseus. But in most of them, that solitary instinct is subordinate to their ancestral habits of large bands, and bands of bands. They are always at war with themselves, and so they are often at war with each other. Sorry, you didn't come for a lecture, I suppose. I just get lost in them sometimes.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Not to worry, your passion refreshes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot; Aleron let him sense that she had moved from anger at a betrayer to the concern of a friend.
“Yes, that would be nice,” Salmerikon answered, excepting her olive branch. 
She was cheered that he had chosen to eat with her. It had been thousands of years since their kind had needed to deliberately eat to survive. Their ancestors had enhanced them with a variety of autotrophic mechanisms. As long as there was any kind of ambient electromagnetic energy, they were fine. And they could survive for days on gravity alone, in the rare event they were cut off from light or other electro-magnetic radiation. Eating was now for pleasure or companionship, for honoring the ancient voices that still spoke in their cells.
She brought out some purple fruit slices, and some dried meats with microherbal implants. She thought the codes that activated them, releasing the fresh tastes of the herbs into the  meat. What the galaxy, she thought, and brought out a wine she knew he especially liked.
They ate in silence, passing back and forth the wave function of their taste sensations, washing each other's minds in a bath of taste and aroma and texture. When they were done, he grasped both of her hands.
&quot;You always know how to cleanse my mind, Aleron.&quot;
&quot;I'm pleased you feel that way,&quot; she said, pausing to consider her response. “I am still trying to cleanse mine, but I see now that there are no simple paths through the asteroid fields in front of us. I can’t quite see my way to approve of what you did with Lina, but I see that you had few other choices. Maybe no other choices. And that disturbs me more than the deed itself.”
“Me, too,” Salmerikon said. “What did you take from the meeting?”
“You are right to be concerned,” she said. “I don’t know what Hankori and Anatope are up to, and they don’t seem inclined to open their minds to share it. That’s my first concern. My second is Putnomo’s abandonment of entanglement as our mode of operation. And my third is that Tanoch stopped short of calling his plan just that. Instead, he chose to emphasize the tactical issue of supporting his department while their obsolence is fulfilled.”
That was what was nagging at me, Salmerikon thought. “Yet I sense no connection between Tanoch and Hankori’s faction.”
“No, I think you were right,” she said. “It is worse than just a self-serving arrangement to guarantee each other’s budget. As you suggested, our colleagues are losing sight of our mission. Traveling by lightspeed ship to contact new species? We are not demi-gods whose mere arrival in galaxy spanning spacecraft would demonstrate our overwhelming superiority. How could we be seen any other way? The other day, I was furious with you for doing that on a very small scale. But nothing has ever said ‘superior race’ more than aliens appearing in a highly advanced space ship.”
Salmerikon was quiet, considering her words. Then he smiled.
“I hadn’t put that final piece together, but now that you point it out to me, you are right. But there is more to it than that, and I have promised not have so many secrets from you, so I am going to tell you something that very few people know. And it should stay that way, at least for now. Are you willing to abide by that?”
“My head says no, but my heart knows that yes is the only real answer here.”
“Your head will soon agree,” he said, relieved that she seemed to understand the stakes. “Putnomo’s presentation also made me uneasy for another reason. Something didn’t add up. As I told you, I have many friends with many kinds of expertise, including advanced propulsion systems and plasma physics. I asked one of them, in loose terms, about Putnomo’s project.””
“Let me guess,” she said. “It will take even longer and cost even more than he suggested.”
“It will take an eternity and cost nothing,” Salmerikon said, “because it is a fraud. It can’t be done.”
“What do you mean, a fraud?”
“My contact says that the project rests on several technologies. One main focus — plasma containment and control — has a solid foundation and the general goals of more advanced control and higher yields are ambitious but reasonable. But then Putnomo makes a leap from better engines to instantaneous acceleration to lightspeed. That is not an engineering problem — the universe won’t allow it.”
“What if he’s discovered some new physics?”
“Undoubtedly he has,” Salmerikon said. “Putnomo makes vague allusions to a new technology that can entirely transform ordinary matter into a sort of three-dimensional, self-contained coherent light wave within a plasma cloud, and then reverse the process upon arrival.”
“So that’s how we travel at lightspeed? We become light, and then revert back to matter on arrival?”
“At its heart, that’s Putnomo’s project. But my sources say that this is simply not possible. There can never be a 100% faithful transformation of matter to energy and back to matter. To put it simply, we can send our thoughts anywhere. We can send our bodies anywhere. But if we send our bodies as thoughts, and then recreate our bodies from those thoughts, they will be randomly different at the atomic level in a random number of ways, ranging from moderate to massive differences. But whether slight or massive, those differences could mean we won’t survive the trip.””
“Well, scientists often disagree, don’t they,” Aleron said, wondering where he was going with this.
“But that’s the thing,” Salmerikon said. “This disagreement was settled thousands of years ago. And this particular detail of Putnomo’s plan was buried in his proposal. Only a few people — fortunately my friend is one of them — could see deeply enough into this to see it’s rotten heart.”
“What do you think it means? What is Putnomo up to?”
“I think it means that Putnomo wants to develop something crucial to Hankori’s agenda, and knows that its true nature must remain hidden.”
“And what do you think that is?”
“I have no idea. But I’m afraid of what it is. And I don’t think I can let this go — I fear that their project is something deeply, fundamentally wrong.”
“If your friend is right, they are certainly behaving as if they know you and many of the rest of us won’t agree to it.”
“Will you help me to uncover this secret, and if I’m right, to stop them?”
Suddenly, she understood what Raefe must feel. All of her talks with him must sound like this: There is a world you know nothing of, but I’m asking you to trust me. And I’m asking you to change your life in ways neither of us yet understand.
“How can I refuse?” she said, her lips tightening in a grim smile.

            <Synopsis>The NVA rescues the passengers. Alton meets Lina, explains the NVA.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Alton peered through the binoculars, scanning the valley. There was definitely some kind of camp down there. He felt strongly that he was in the right place. He tapped his Voice off mute. Today was reggae code day.
“Bob Marley, this is Dennis Brown,” he said. “Are you hearing my jams?”
“Dennis Brown, got your reggae loud and clear,” Henry answered. “You called it, brother. This is the place. I see the colors, over toward those shacks.”
Alton saw what he meant — the Snakehead flag. So this was their camp.
“All those tents — you think that’s the people from the train?” Alton asked. “Anyone can see?”
There were three dozen of them scattered on the ridge overlooking the valley. Slowly, the picture emerged — white men and women on one side, everyone else on the other side. The Snakeheads weren’t expecting company, and many of them must have gone home to wherever, but there were still a dozen or so watching nearly 100 prisoners. Alton knew that sooner or later, people would come for the prisoners, sending them off to work uranium mines in the West, or some such shit. Some of the women would be shipped off to be fuck toys for some corpo.
It had been three days already — the Snakeheads wouldn’t hold them here much longer. His three dozen could get the job done, they had all seen combat in some army somewhere before joining up for the New Voodo Army. If they waited for dark, they could take them easy, without warning. Now, maybe not.
“Drummer, bass, keys, guitar — I like those trees near that big boulder halfway along the ridge.” He made his way over to the boulder. He wanted to talk to the four squad leaders. They needed to plan this very carefully.
“Here’s what I see,” Alton said. “We got maybe a dozen militia, assorted Snakehead civilians. They’re not too alert, but they got lots of weapons. Maybe some of their other people pick up the gun if they have to. I personally don’t care if we shoot them all, but we don’t want them killing the people we came to save. On the other hand, we don’t know if someone come to take the prisoners. So Henry,  I want two men to watch the road in — you look for any vehicles headed this way. The rest of your squad, stay above the shacks and eyeball the Snakeheads. Anything sign that they’re moving out, causing trouble, whatever — you let everyone know.”
“Got it, “ Henry said. “You know who their leader is?”
“I do,” Flowers said. She spit on the ground. “Calls himself Jeff Davis, weezy bastard. I come up against him before, he want to lay hands on me. He’s in front of the shack with their flag. Wearing a blue t-shirt, beard, baseball cap.”
“I’ll keep an eye on him,” Henry said. “Tell him you said hey, if it comes up.”
“Alright,” Alton said. “The rest is basic. Flowers, you take your squad behind the black folks’ tents. Clearwater, you do the same with the white folks. Stay in the woods. We wait for dark, Snakeheads probably get messed up on Wyn and booze,  pay us no never mind. When I give the signal, send one person in each tent, see if you can sneak them out the back real quiet, into the woods.”
“Let me guess,” Benny said. “We got the Snakeheads.”
“That’s my man,” Alton smiled. “I’m with you. After I give the word, we keep them in our gunsights the whole time. Any luck, they wake up tomorrow and find the place empty. Don’t go that way, place still be quiet tomorrow. Either way, we take all the prisoners straight out the road until we get to our trucks. Straight back to DC.”
***
When the time came, it went easier than Alton expected. The Snakeheads didn’t just get messed up, they got obliterated. Bunch of junkies, lying all over the place around the shacks. Just three or four guards by the tents, and they were pretty high, too. They could have taken everyone out the back and they’d have never known. But there were some prisoners who were hurt, and one who was unconscious and they needed some time to get them out. Benny’s squad snuck up on them, quick chokeholds and they were on the ground before they could make a sound. Alton tied them up, put NVA’s signature black and yellow beanies on them just so there’d be no confusion. He wanted Davis to know they’d done this to him. Davis’ buyers would not be happy when they came.
They took back roads up to DC and got there just before dawn. Alton got on a sat phone to Goodstuff Benjamin, the leader of  the NVA in Nigeria. Benjamin was at war with United Energy Resources mercs in the Niger River delta. He had suspected some US crazies were being brought in and asked Alton to keep an eye on the Snakeheads in particular.
“Mr. Benjamin, it’s Alton Winchester in DC. Thought you’d want to know, the Snakeheads poked their heads up and took down a civilian solar train a few days ago.”
“Solar train?” Benjamin asked. “What would they do that for? Nothing but poor folks on a train like that.”
“Truth,” Alton answered. “And more than that, they brought about 100 of them back to their camp to sell off. But they split them up into black and white. The passengers tell me their leader calls himself Jeff Davis — he was the head of the confederacy in our civil war 200 years ago — and was going on about White America.”
“Yeah, he’s been drifting that way for awhile. Not enough to be a lowlife junkie train jacker, got to have a cause.”
“Still, to me it sounds like he’s been talking to Robby Koch’s boys. Every time they want to chop of some mountain top or dump some shit in the river out, they tell the locals they’re keeping White America free.”
“Well, that makes sense than. You know we’re up against his UER mercs here. They usually hire the best -- Brightstar or one of the other big multinational armies. But lately, we get reports about some rag tag white mercs — crazies. Helicopter into a village, shoot it up, rape the women and just leave. Trying to figure out whether they were ex-Russian Army from the third Chechen War, US militia crazies or what. Maybe I got my answer.”
“Maybe. They killed some people, so I got to keep them on my radar now. Just wanted to let you know, since you asked. We’ve been up all night and we have some wounded passengers to look after before we can sleep. I’ll be in touch.”
“Thanks.”
Alton walked across the NVA village to the infirmary. Several people were getting cuts cleaned up, two people had broken bones. He walked over to the stretcher with the guy in the coma. A young woman sat, holding his hand.
“Your friend?” he asked.
“Boyfriend,” she answered. “I’m Lina, he’s Raefe.”
“Hi, I’m Alton. Do you know how he got this way?”
“Some racist motherfucker hit him in the head with a rifle butt when he didn’t like them splitting us up, white and black.” She told him the story.
“You  OK?” he asked. “Anything I can do for you?”
“No, you already done it,” she answered. “Us Efricar fugees, this shit ain’t nothing new. I’ll be OK. Why’d you come after us?”
“I been watching the Snakeheads for awhile. That trainjack, it was on the net, but they didn’t say anything about the Snakeheads. Still, it stuck in my mind — why hold up a train full of migrant workers? Didn’t make sense. Kept bugging me and I started digging into it. Started putting two and two together. I just felt that the NVA had to take a stand or why bother?”
“Glad you did. I thought you guys were mostly into ecotech and all that.”
“Yeah, we mostly are. We liked what the original NVA did in Nigeria, cleaning up all that oil pollution in the rivers, trying to rebuild the local culture, but not in some backward looking way, like all the jihadists. And we liked how they steered between the corrupt politicians in Lagos and the Boko Haram crazies up north. Trying to figure out what that would mean here. But Goodstuff Benjamin, he made it clear that NVA is also an army — we speak truth to power, but we back it up, too.”
“I’ve got to think on that,” Lina said, always wary of men with guns. “I’m just happy we can sit here and talk about it. But I’m worried about Raefe. His pulse is good, he’s breathing OK, but he’s been out cold for three days. Nasty bash on the side of his head.”
“We got a friendly doctor on the way,” Alton said. “It’s crazy, but I feel strength coming from this kid. He may be lying there still, but I feel like he’s definitely on the scene.”
“Authentic,” Lina said. “Lately, he surprises that way.”

            <Title>Des uncovers attack plan</Title>
            <Text>Ever since Des had told him how the waveform had harmonies that might be useful, Raefe had been trying to train himself to find them. At first, he wondered if Des had been mistaken. No matter how he tried, he could not find feel any minds other than in the giant broad rainbow of thoughts he always heard. Then one day he had been sitting on a bench on Cambridge Common when a young woman walked by with a baby in a stroller. He thought, that baby is going to cry and seconds later it did.
And then he thought, mom’s going to give the baby a monkey and laughed. What an odd thing to think! And then the woman pulled a stuffed animal out of the large bag handing on the stroller and handed it to the baby. It was a toy monkey. The baby stopped crying.
This must be it, he thought. I sensed some communication between them. Do mothers and babies have their own lane in the waveform? He stared away from the pair so they wouldn’t notice him. He closed his eyes and slowed his breathing. He could hear the mother’s mind in all the usual ways but now he could hear her mind wane, almost pause and then…there it was! She had shifted her thoughts in the waveform to the baby’s frequency or wavelength or whatever it was. Just for a few seconds and then she was back. He shut out everything but her mind, being careful not to touch it enough to alarm her. And he saw how she did it, unthinkingly. It was a bit like squinting, a bit like changing your focus from far to near.
The next time she did it, he was able to mimic her. And then he heard it, the baby’s mind. It was a note of contentment. The mother smiled and went back to her previous thoughts.  Did all mother’s do that? All babies? He had to tell Des. 
Des was always easy to find. No one on Earth had their mind in as many places as him at one time, and no one had quite his mental signature.
“I’ve done it,” Raefe said. “What you explained to me.”
“Wow! What’s it like?”
“Just starting out. Follow me now.” And Raefe replayed his memory of the mother and child.
“Oh, that’s interesting!”
“Yes, much more here than just a back channel, eh? Let’s talk more about that when it’s safe. Do you think we can try to have this conversation there?”
And he felt Des make that switch that the mother had. And Raefe followed and he still felt Des’s mind. Nothing was really different, it just felt a bit odd, like singing a note that was at the edge of your range.
“It’s quieter here,” Des said. “Like we have the room to ourself. Almost — I can hear occasional blips from the child.”
“It’s really just a baby — probably can’t even talk yet.”
“I’ve actually never tangled with a baby,” Des said. “I’ll have to ask Anti if she does with her kids.”
“There’s so much the Guardians never told us, it makes you wonder how much more we don’t know about entangling. But let’s put that aside for the moment. I’m anxious to hear what you’ve learned about our old sparring partners.”
“Still digging, but so far, it’s not good. They’re definitely planning something and soon. I think they want to test their abilities on more than just a prisoner in a chair. And I think that means that they will try an action somewhere nearby.”
“We’re as near as it gets to them,” Raefe said.
“I agree and I think you may be in danger,” Des said.
“Can you find out more?”
“Yes, but so can you,” Des said. “But maybe you shouldn’t — they know your mind. Who else is adept in your circle? Who you can trust?”
“Tosh, for sure,” Raefe said.
“Of course,” Des said. “We should ask him if he’s willing to scout them. It’s not without risk.”
“I’m happy to ask him. I’m sure he’ll say yes. But I don’t know if I can explain what he should be looking for. I can, however, show him how to tangle like this.”
“I can tell him what to look for. Tell him to find me when he’s ready. He’ll need help, too. Are there three or four people who are safe to train for this?”
“Yes, for sure. But how can we prepare ourselves? Are we talking about picking up and moving? Fighting back somehow? Figuring out ways to protect ourselves?”
“Might be moving at first, but I don’t think for long. Once they deploy, I feel like we’ll probably be able to figure out how to defuse their attack. Like I said when we talked before, they don’t really get what they’re doing. People here are working on counter measures, too. We just need to buy time.”
“Okay. I always have a bag packed. Force of habit. Find me this way, though. Don’t hesitate, day or night. And think about how we want to use these new channels. Who else? Mom, Mari, of course, and now Tosh. But who else?</Text>

            <Title>Raefe comes to Thunberg</Title>
            <Synopsis>Des tells him he has been experimenting with scanning his own brain and shows him how to do it.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It had been a whirlwind month at Thunberg for Raefe. After Radisson and the boat trip, the welcome mat had been rolled out for him.One team leader after another had introduced themselves, proudly described their team’s role and accomplishments, and invited him to take part in their activities. And he had. For the last four weeks, he had been part of all sorts of production teams. He had helped build a house, made from bricks he had helped make, made from chemicals he had helped to make from the air and the soil. Trees and grasses had been planted, irrigation had been constructed. He had seen the 3D printers, the AI farm that churned out the patterns for them, the solar and wind farm that powered them all. Four new homes had been built from what seemed like thin air. They would be net negative carbon homes, slowly drawing down the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In a century or two, if the world followed suit, they might be back to mid-20th century levels. Twice as long, preindustrial levels. If they could survive that long, they would succeed in reverting to a more natural state. By that time, many species would be long extinct, but at least they would be returning the planet to a broad range of niches for life to slowly reinhabit and for humans to coexist with.
Today he was feeling his age. He wasn’t actually a citizen of Thunberg, so his presence on the work details was optional. This afternoon he was going to exercise that option and beg off helping to build a water filtration station. Still, he was restless and decided to go for a walk along the river.  Before he could make his way to the footpath along the banks, he felt Nila tickling his mind. They had met up when he first arrived, and talked a bit over the weeks, but he realized that he had never really had a good long talk with her. She had the afternoon off, so he invited her to go for a walk with him. He found her where the village path met the river path, all smiles.
They exchanged pleasantries for a bit as they walked east.
“You know,” he said, “I’ve never explored what’s east of the village. Have you?”
“A bit,” she said. “It gets wilder. I don’t think any people actually lived here before the thaw, at least not for a very long time. I’m not even sure animals did. It might have been mostly ice and snow except for a brief summer.”
“I imagine the river had fish. And where there’s fish, there’s birds, at least, I would think.”
“Yeah, probably,” she said. “I mean, I’m just a city kid. But it just seems so untouched. Almost blank.”
“We’re always talking about how we should be humble toward nature. But some times we forget that much of the planet — all of the seas, for example— were places we could only travel through. Not settle. The marks we’ve left on them were completely inadvertent.”
“Right, not like we chopped down all the forests up here,” she said. “Tall trees haven’t been here since before the last ice age. And now, they probably will grow here in the coming years, for better or for worse.”
“Seems like humanity’s motto now,” he said. “’Let’s try something new, for better or for worse.’ Ironic, given that the last 400 years or more was driven by such certainty that we were the best thing to ever happen to Earth.”
“I used to get in big arguments with my mom about that. I’d say, why are you always down on anyone who’s trying to do something new? What have we got to lose? And she’s say, oh, there’s nothing new about all of this. People who have nothing are always trying to take stuff from people who worked hard to build a better life.”
“Can’t tell you how many corpos I’ve heard say something like that,” Raefe said. “You try and take it apart piece by piece — Who did the work, actually? Why did you force them to take what they need? Why was it so important to you to possess more than you do need? But it’s an ancient belief system that’s been honed to take root in a way that makes it hard to dislodge.”
“It’s like a fucking virus,” she said. “It not only makes you sick, but forces you to replicate and infect others.”
Raefe laughed. “Did you tell her that?”
“Not exactly,” she replied, smiling. “If I thought arguing with her would have changed anything, I would still be in New Kendall.”
“So you’re going to stay in Thunberg?” he asked.
“Well, now that’s a tough one,” she said. “But probably not.”

            <Text>Secret experiments
Hanakori has picked the location with great care. On the slopes of Anonto’s only active volcano, there is an ancient lava tube. Deep at the bottom, there is boiling lava that sends hot air out of a vent at the top. But there is also small chute that leads to it, whose entrance is hidden by rocks that block its view, but still leave room to enter. The shape of the tube prevents too much heat from entering it. But the entire area is filled with masses of swirling ions generated by the lava below. There is so much quantum activity that most Guardians could never penetrate the static to entangle with him, let alone an ordinary Anontan. 
Hanakori, on the other hand, has made a study of quantum noise and has perfected his own filtering techniques. So the cave is safe from prying minds. Still, he trusts no one.
“Anatope, prepare a quantum key for this meeting. No one must know what we are discussing.”
All 17 of them absorb the four-dimensional construct that will allow them to converse in isolation, their waveform impossible to comingle with any other without their knowledge.
“This meeting couldn’t come at a more crucial time,” Hanakori said. “The most naïve of the Guardian ambassadors, Aleron, has gone beyond her usual silly projects — recently she had cadets catch fish in their teeth — and is now revealing herself to the barbarians of Earth. These are nothing more than killers, and yet she has blinded herself to their natures.”
“What of it, Hanakori?” Putnomo interrupted. “Let her waste her time while they destroy themselves.”
“You are many light years from them,” Hanakori answered. “We are only six. She may already be breaking her oath and leaking technical information to them. I believe her objectivity may be compromised.  If she persists, in a millennia or two, they may well develop the means to threaten not only us, but other nearby species.”
“Hanakori, you are a politician and you excel at the age-old craft of frightening the populace. I am a scientist,” Putnomo said. “Earth  could not become a threat to us in ten millennia, even if they survive.”
“Are you willing to bet the future of all life on that, Putnomo?” Anatope interrupted with disgust. “Perhaps you won’t feel so complacent when you learn that Salmerikon  tells you that the Guardian Council says you must make do with less energy for your lightspeed engine development. When he tells you the energy is needed to continue shifting humans to timelines where they haven’t blown themselves up, you will surely reconsider.”
 “Enough,” Hanakori thundered, the waveform vibrating with his intensity. “Let us not forget our purpose today.””
“Thank you,” Putnomo said. “Whatever our differing opinions about Aleron and Earth, we can all agree that the most important thing is to press ahead with our work on e12.””
Only they know that e12 is the latest iteration in their top-secret research they have been carrying out for more than a thousand years. 
 “I have excellent news to report,” Putnomo said. “About 1,100 years ago, we Guarded a very unusual species on the outer edges of the Eta Carinae nebula. It was the only life, let alone intelligent life, that we have ever found that was composed of only organized gas and plasma. We learned very little about it before Eta Carinae erupted in a partial nova that destroyed the region. For those of you who are new to our efforts, it was this encounter that started Hanakori and myself and a few others to realize that with some effort, this kind of life could be immortal.
 “Three things had to be solved to make that happen. The first – reducing an individual’s consciousness to free-standing waves ––– is already something all of our species could do, if we had not bound ourselves foolishly to retain our ancient forms. The second was how to overcome entropy – how can a waveform, in essence, eat while still retaining its essential nature? The third was how to continue to manipulate matter while remaining pure energy.””
Hanakori could hardly contain his impatience. Putnomo was always so impressed with himself. “So what have you learned recently?”
He let them see his laboratory, hidden by a cloud of comets. Inside was a force field in which only a large plasma cloud existed, suspended by intense magnetic fields. They watched as Putnomo donned a helmet on his homeworld, nearly a billion kilometers away. For a few seconds nothing happened and then Putnomo allowed them to entangle with the plasma cloud itself, through him. And then he broke his connection with them.
The waveform shuddered as they all gasped. The plasma cloud retained much of Putnomo’s consciousness. In fact, it shifted gradually as they entangled with it.
Putnomo reconnected with them. “Yes, I was able to project my consciousness into the cloud, and while it couldn’t think entirely new thoughts, it did react to you in small ways. For the first time, we have created consciousness in a cloud of plasma.”
The waveform pulsed with approval and delight. Even Hanakori was impressed.
“Are there fundamental issues you still need to address?” he wondered.
“Not fundamental ones, no. We have maybe a decade or two of engineering before we can attempt a full transfer, and then perhaps some more time to ensure stability. But there is every reason to believe that we have found a way to preserve consciousness for all time. In short, to be immortal.”
“And what about the third obstacle,”  Anatope asked. “Does any of this bode well for addressing that?”
“We have been working in parallel on that. We chose the confined plasma precisely because we have known for millennia how to control it. It was one of the main technologies of the controlled fusion era. Reversing that, having the plasma control ordinary matter, is challenging but conceptually well understood.” Putnomo was in all his glory now. “I feel strongly that we are perhaps 100 years away from a demonstration combining conscious energy and material control.”
Hankori steered them back to the immediate threat. “All the more reason to not waste time or resources on foolishness. The lightspeed engine project is our cover story, and we need to keep the project alive, even if it’s mostly fake.””
“What is your proposal?” asked Putnomo.
Hankori hesitated. He wasn’t interested in fully revealing his plans. “For now, we should all exercise vigilance over this ridiculous project with the humans. And we must lay the groundwork for us to turn the Guardians from the  fostering of any kind of conscious life to the further development of our species, who are the highest form of consciousness.”
“What is at stake,” he continued, “is nothing less than the evolution of conscious life itself. In a million millennia, only 20 species have in the entire galaxy have reached the stage of enhanced life. Should we spend another billion years hoping to find a few more? And leave ourselves vulnerable to forces beyond our control? To the whims of supernovas? To attack from far corners of the galaxy, or from beings in other galaxies who have gone beyond us in lightspeed travel or solved the riddle of faster than light travel?”
“We have earned immortality, and we deserve it. Let us turn the Guardians from this foolish philosophy of naïve benevolence to one of true Guardianship – of our species, and our future.”
The meeting is over, and Hanakori feels minds drop away. But Anatope lingers.
“Are you not concerned about this development with this Raefe?” he asks. Hankori was being unusually eliptical about it.
“I am quite concerned,” Hankori said. “But I have a plan.”
“Care to share it,” Anatope asks. “We’ve been in this together for a long time.”
“And we will share a victory toast. Soon. For now, the most good you can do is to keep an eye on Aleron. She is such a foolish being. She will be an important unwitting ally.”

            <Text>NOVEL WITH PARTS

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
Create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel. For instance, Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being’s first part is entitled “PART ONE: Lightness and Weight”. In that example, you would name the part, “Lightness and Weight” (the “Part One” will be added during Compile). You can choose not to include these titles during the Compile process.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) Some chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information. (The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; placeholders will be replaced during compile with the information you provide in the Project Properties tab of Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings…, or you can delete them and enter whatever text you like.)
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Standard Manuscript Format (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the menu button next to it (this is already selected by default).
Click “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter\Paperback Novel folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected.
Click “Compile”.

To compile to e-book format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter\E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (This does not affect the cover image.)
If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to click “Cover” in the left sidebar and select the image from the “Cover Image” menu button.
From the “Compile for” menu button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
Click “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
Part subtitles: If you don’t want to include the titles of your “Part” folders in your compiled manuscript, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” for the “Level 1” folder item. Then click on “Section Layout…” and remove the colon and space at the end of the title prefix (“Part &lt;$R&gt;”).
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” for the “Level 2+” folder item and the “Level 1” and “Level 2” text items. (Conversely, if you do want to include chapter titles for formats that don’t include them by default, tick these items.)
Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Page size: The “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking the menu button beside “Paper Size” in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings. Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are contained directly inside the “Part” folders (that is, at the same level as the current “Chapter” folders).
Move the chapter folders to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile dialog, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, select them and choose Format &gt; Formatting &gt; Preserve Formatting.
Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available in Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format (with Parts)”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” format; and “ADE E-Book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book (with Parts)” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in Adobe Digital Editions on a PC.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Text>Unenhanced feelings
November 3, 2048
Aleron looked out across the auditorium, filled with a dozen species of air-breathers from as many planets. The room had adapted to them, providing perches for the hawkish Rayva, long pallets for the large, bearish Mondoni, and seats of whatever size were needed by the other species. On the other side of the auditorium’s thick glass walls was what the students called The Tank — a series of liquid-filled chambers of various temperatures and chemistries for eight different marine species. She felt all of their thoughts merge into a complex waveform washing over her. Her mind rapidly adjusted and became another element in it. The cadets were eager to hear her thoughts.
“You’ve all gotten your assignments, the species you will be studying for the remainder of your training. I can sense that you all are anxious about being effective Guardians working with species that can only communicate in a limited way with you. With species that live in the world all of our ancestors lived in, whether that was 10,000 years ago, as the A’Mopto, my species, did, or one million years ago as you Alaxazayawa did, or only 700 years ago, as the HooHooHu did.
“And that world is one dominated by unenhanced experience of whatever original organic senses your assigned species have evolved with. Most will also have some electronic or mechanical aids – mine have computers, books, videos, audios and other means ––– but even those they experience through the senses.”
“How is that different than us?” one of the students asked.
“OK, class, who knows what the heaviest isotope of strontium is?”
Almost instantly, the entire class waveform resonated with “Strontium 105.”
“Correct. Your enhanced minds accessed a number of databases that contained that info, and barring corrupted data, you all knew the correct answer instantly. If you were unenhanced, some of you would know that from past experience, some of you would misremember it, some of you might not even know what the question meant. And that’s just a simple fact. Everything they learn, everything they know and remember, is through the unfaithful lens of their senses.”
“But here’s the odd part,” she continued. “Eventually you will get to know an unenhanced being and you will see that they view this as natural. They will view you as less than natural, part machine, and they will be suspicious. But mostly, I want you to sense the mixture of knowledge and emotion that is their mental lifeblood, and feel how that balance is different than yours. You can get a clue from the external sensory stimuli that they create. I’ve prepared sampling from the species called humans that I work with of these sorts of artificial experiences, which are common in many unenhanced species.” 
She gave them a glimpse of what Raefe saw in the vids he watched, a few hours of programming that their minds could absorb in minutes. “What’s the first thing you notice about them?””
“Very imaginative!” one of the cadets exclaimed. “Their ability to build unreal but realistic worlds is impressive. But there’s so little information embedded in them.”
“Yes, everything is sound and color. A world where people can do magical things, but they never even speculate about how,” another thought.
“But hard to ignore,” a third added. “And impossible to turn off, at least some of it.”
 “We can feel the two most important things about these experiences,” Aleron summarized. “First, we can all blend our own direct experience and memory with enormous amounts of data outside our own minds.  Not so the unenhanced — they must process over time – sometimes even a lifetime – to penetrate the surface of their own experiences. Perhaps most importantly, as some of you just pointed out, up to 100% of the content of these documents and images are emotional. For example, in the vid you just watched, a fleet of human spacefighters defends their planet against a massive alien fleet. And the planet is saved. Adno, how would you interpret that?”
“They seem to have a deep fear of other species,” the large, tentacled female replied from the coldest of the water tanks. “And a strong need to convince themselves they can defend their planet.”
“But they’ve never contacted other species,” Toneva, one of the avian Rayva, protested. “Why would they think space holds nothing but threats? And why would an advanced species care so much about them?”
“Precisely,” Aleron agreed. “And there are so many other illogical ideas in this vid. How could Earth possibly win against such a force so technically superior? No, none of that makes sense. In fact, that is not at all the point of this story. Anyone think they know what is?”
She could feel them weighing different ideas, none convincing to them. 
“No one? Don’t feel bad — younger species have their own logic. This vid is one of hundreds, if not thousands, with a similar plot. What’’s important to grasp is that it details a struggle with what humans call ‘aliens’ — and in most of their languages, that word does mean other species from space, but it more commonly means other humans from other political units and cultures. What the hero is literally doing in these vids is keeping someone — his family, his town, his country, his ethnic group — safe from aliens. But deep down, many humans experience this as keeping their political or cultural unit safe from the more common aliens — humans who are slightly different from them. And many other species repeat this pattern.”
“Are you saying that humans routinely destroy large groups of other humans because they are different?” Adno asked.
“Sadly, yes,” Aleron said. “But all of our ancestors did the same. What I want you to try and grasp here is that the humans who would never do that, who might even vigorously oppose that, will still watch this vid and cheer for the hero and thoroughly enjoy it. They will not be aware that in part their enjoyment comes from this symbolic purging of aliens. They will feel the emotion, but they won’t be fully aware of its content. But sometime in the future, they may actively carry out this preprogramming.”
“How can they truly feel something if they are neither aware of it or understand it?” asked a student.
“You are asking that because you can get to the truth about so many things in a nanosecond and then you can form feelings based on how that truth meshes with what you already know and feel. But most young species develop a complex system of emotion and thought running in parallel, intertwining and recursive. To put it simply, ideally they act emotionally, analyze the results logically, and modify their emotions accordingly in an endless cycle. Realistically, emotions can be hard to change, truth hard to find, and yet they still must act to survive. Over time, this cause them to develop deep culturally reinforced behavioral patterns that eventually run counter to their true long, term survival needs. That is the most common cause of the failure of intelligent species to survive.”
She could feel the waveform rebelling against this concept. How could such species be called intelligent? They sounded more like species that had not yet crossed that threshold. A very smart predator, but not at all like real intelligent life.
“Ah, now you see how it works. They don’t conform to your notions of intelligence. So you think they are not. And from there it’s only a small step toward being willing to destroy them if they do something threatening.”
The rebellious waveform collapsed. The cadets were ashamed, which she was glad of.
“So now you have begun your training as Guardians. You begin to understand that all intelligent life takes twisted paths to develop. And that we have much work to do if we are to foster that life and avoid the traps of our ancestors.”

            <Synopsis>Raefe and the team run the new game, with it's empathy algorithms. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Changing the rules
July 12, 2049
Raefe sat in the back of the small auditorium, watching images flow into and out of the big vid screen upfront as if it were some new installation from Maru Imani Baraka, the Afro-Japanese artist who was all the rage among people who enjoyed watching semi-autonomous colorful blobs dance with each other willy nilly. This was, after all, pure theater for the Reagan Institute people.
His reworked code had allowed the team to fulfill their grant. Storage farms full of the data his code had generated would keep the RI people busy for years. For only a few million dollars, they would be able to propose wringing billions of dollars of social benefits out of the system with a more informed hope that it wouldn’t spark riots or unintentionally bring the wheels of commerce to a grinding halt. Meanwhile, everyone oohed and aahed as the  Civilization Project slides traced their incomplete history of humanity. “Wait until version 2!” was the mantra. All it lacked was a catchy theme song.
When it was done, Roshi and the RIers went off amid prodigious mutual backslapping to celebrate the completion of the project. Raefe found Elise and Joe back in the lab.
“You missed the big show,” Raefe said. “Roshi had them gasping with delight. Like six-year olds watching their first DisneyDream vid.”
“She suggested we wouldn’t really like it that much,” Joe said.  “She knows we know the whole thing is a sham.”
“And she wants us to keep going with our version,” Elise said. “RI was a big cash score. Now she wants some academic cred from us.”
“So what did you learn from the new code while I was gone?” Raefe asked.
“We’re not sure,” Elise confessed. “On the one hand, for some stretches of time, the new sim comes tantalizingly close to recreating the main outlines of history.”
“But then, it goes off the rails completely,” Joe added. “Major events in history never show up, major events in the sim never actually happened.”
“I think I know why,” Raefe said.
“Did you find a mistake in the coding?” Elise said, surprised. 
“No, it’s not that,” Raefe said. “It’s what I saw in Africa that made me think about it.” Well, that’s a not entirely true, he thought, but I’m not ready to tell them about entanglement…yet.
“Say more,” said Joe.
“You asked me to code  vectors for collaboration, competition, hierarchy, equality, and along various dimensions. National, sexual, and so on. What if all of those things interacted with each other?”
“But don’t we already account for that?” Elise said. “When the economy is going full blast, we weight things one way. When it’s middling another, very poorly, different again.”
“What if there were another force at work, that more fundamentally changed our collaborative behavior, for example?” Raefe said. “What if this force made us more collaborative regardless of the economy or wars or other factors you built in? What if, in fact, another force actually overcame the forces that drive wars or economic inequality? Or if its absence drove them?”
“What are you getting at?” asked Joe.
“Empathy,” said Raefe.
“Empathy?” said Elise, skeptical. “Why would that be different than any other interpersonal emotion — love, hate, greed — and so on?”
“Because empathy is more basic than that,” Raefe said. “Empathy is hardwired into not just people, but all mammals. And many birds. And who knows what other animals. You look at it as a consequence. It’s actually a complex attribute.”
“Of what?” Elise asked.
“Of being able to understand what your fellow creatures are thinking by watching what they’re doing. Your brain says “Oh, she’s waving. When I wave it means I’m glad to see you. So she must be glad to see me.” And all this happens way below the conscious level, fed by sight, sound, smell, gestures — a whole host of signs we’re only partially aware of. Animals evolved to collaborate within their own species without the elaborate thought processes and  communications abilities we have. They have an innate ability to get past the immediate competition for food and mates to remain a pack or herd that travels together, protects their young, distributes their food, and polices their members, up to a point.”
“Holy shit, you’re right,” Joe said. “You’ve just defined civilization, except it’s with animals. We were so focused on technology and resources that we missed that.”
“If you had been with me and seen the people who had saved Lina, you couldn’t have missed it.”
“Yet all those people are victims of the worst kind of aggression,” Lina said. “Where was empathy then?”
“Exactly, that’s the question,” Raefe said. “How do empathy and self-interest get reconciled in our brains, and then how does that translate to social and societal behavior? Why does it all go so wrong sometimes, and other times, so right?”
“Computational empathy,” Joe said. “There’s some groundbreaking shit. If only I had any idea of where to start.”
“Try this,” Raefe said, sending Joe’s puter a cloud address. “It’s just a start, but on the plane home I went back into the code and added empathy vectors in. They work both positively and negatively, so you can play with them in both directions. But you’re the math guy. I don’t know how to make them dynamic and I don’t know how to build a network so that they interact with other vectors. But I’m pretty sure that empathy can drive a reduction in competition or inequality, and that a lack of it can drive the reverse.”
“What if we’re just poking at another surface variable,” Elise said. “What if empathy is itself just a reflection of something deeper?”
Like entangement, Raefe smiled to himself. No flies on you.
“Then that will show up in the sim,” he said. “It’s just an idea I had. Are you willing to build it and run it?”
“Hell, yeah,” Joe said. “This is some deep shit.”

            <Synopsis>Putonomo reveals his science project. Hankori sets Anatope to watch Aleron.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Hanakori has picked the location with great care. On the slopes of Anonto’s only active volcano, there is an ancient lava tube. Deep at the bottom, there is boiling lava that sends hot air out of a vent at the top. But there is also small chute that leads to it, whose entrance is hidden by rocks that block its view, but still leave room to enter. The shape of the tube prevents too much heat from entering it. But the entire area is filled with masses of swirling ions generated by the lava below. There is so much quantum activity that most Guardians could never penetrate the static to entangle with him, let alone an ordinary A’Moptan. 
Hanakori, on the other hand, has made a study of quantum noise and has perfected his own filtering techniques. So the cave is safe from prying minds. Still, he trusts no one.
“Anatope, prepare a quantum key for this meeting. No one must know what we are discussing.”
All 17 of them absorb the four-dimensional construct that will allow them to converse in isolation, their waveform impossible to comingle with any other without their knowledge.
“This meeting couldn’t come at a more crucial time,” Hanakori said. “The most naïve of the Guardian ambassadors, Aleron, has gone beyond her usual silly projects — recently she had cadets catch fish in their teeth — and is now revealing herself to the barbarians called the People. These are nothing more than killers, and yet she has blinded herself to their natures.”
“What of it, Hanakori?” Putnomo interrupted. “Let her waste her time while they destroy themselves.”
“You are many light years from them,” Hanakori answered. “We are only six. She may already be breaking her oath and leaking technical information to them. I believe her objectivity may be compromised.  If she persists, in a millennia or two, they may well develop the means to threaten not only us, but other nearby species.”
“Hanakori, you are a politician and you excel at the age-old craft of frightening the populace. I am a scientist,” Putnomo said. “The People could not become a threat to us in ten millennia, even if they survive.”
“Are you willing to bet the future of all life on that, Putnomo?” Anatope interrupted with disgust. “Perhaps you won’t feel so complacent when you learn that Salmerikon  tells you that the Guardian Council says you must make do with less energy for your lightspeed engine development. When he tells you the energy is needed to continue shifting People to timelines where they haven’t blown themselves up, you will surely reconsider.”
 “Enough,” Hanakori thundered, the waveform vibrating with his intensity. “Let us not forget our purpose today.”
“Thank you,” Putnomo said. “Whatever our differing opinions about Aleron and Earth, we can all agree that the most important thing is to press ahead with our work on e12.”
Only they know that e12 is the latest iteration in their top-secret research they have been carrying out for more than a thousand years. 
 “I have excellent news to report,” Putnomo said. “About 1,100 years ago, we Guarded a very unusual species on the outer edges of the Eta Carinae nebula. It was the only life, let alone intelligent life, that we have ever found that was composed of only organized gas and plasma. We learned very little about it before Eta Carinae erupted in a small nova that destroyed the region. For those of you who are new to our efforts, it was this encounter that started Hanakori and myself and a few others to realize that with some effort, this kind of life could be immortal.
 “Three things had to be solved to make that happen. The first – reducing an individual’s consciousness to free-standing waves –– is already something all of our species could do, if we had not bound ourselves foolishly to retain our ancient forms. The second was how to overcome entropy – how can a waveform, in essence, eat while still retaining its essential nature? The third was how to continue to manipulate matter while remaining pure energy.”
Hanakori could hardly contain his impatience. Putnomo was always so impressed with himself. “So what have you learned recently?”
He let them see his laboratory, hidden by a cloud of comets. Inside, a force field in which only a large plasma cloud existed, suspended by intense magnetic fields. They watched as Putnomo donned a helmet on his homeworld, nearly a billion kilometers away. For a few seconds nothing happened and then Putnomo allowed them to entangle with the plasma cloud itself, through him. And then he broke his connection with them.
The waveform shuddered as they all gasped. The plasma cloud retained much of Putnomo’s consciousness. In fact, it shifted gradually as the entangled with it.
Putnomo reconnected with them. “Yes, I was able to project my consciousness into the cloud, and while it couldn’t think entirely new thoughts, it did react to you in small ways. For the first time, we have created consciousness in a cloud of plasma.”
The waveform pulsed with approval and delight. Even Hanakori was impressed.
“Are there fundamental issues you still need to address?” he wondered.
“Not fundamental ones, no. We have maybe a decade or two of engineering before we can attempt a full transfer, and then perhaps some more time to ensure stability. But there is every reason to believe that we have found a way to preserve consciousness for all time. In short, to be immortal.”
“And what about the third obstacle,”  Anatope asked. “Does any of this bode well for addressing that?”
“We have been working in parallel on that. We chose the confined plasma precisely because we have known for millennia how to control it. It was one of the main technologies of the controlled fusion era. Reversing that, having the plasma control ordinary matter, is challenging but conceptually well understood.” Putnomo was in all his glory now. “I feel strongly that we are perhaps 100 years away from a demonstration combining conscious energy and material control.”
Hankori steered them back to the immediate threat. “All the more reason to not waste time or resources on foolishness. The lightspeed engine project is our cover story, and we need to keep the project alive, even if it’s mostly fake.”
“What is your proposal?” asked Putnomo.
Hankori hesitated. He wasn’t interested in fully revealing his plans. “For now, we should all exercise vigilance over this ridiculous project with the People. And we must lay the groundwork for us to turn the Guardians from the naïve fostering of any kind of conscious life to the further development of our species, who are the highest form of consciousness.”
“What is at stake,” he continued, “is nothing less than the evolution of conscious life itself. In a million millennia, only 20 species have in the entire galaxy have reached the stage of enhanced life. Should we spend another billion years hoping to find a few more? And leave ourselves vulnerable to forces beyond our control? To the whims of supernovas? To attack from far corners of the galaxy, or from beings in other galaxies who have gone beyond us in lightspeed travel or solved the riddle of faster than light travel?”
“We have earned immortality, and we deserve it. Let us turn the Guardians from this foolish philosophy of naïve benevolence to one of true Guardianship – of our species, and our future.”
The meeting is over, and Hanakori feels minds drop away. But Anatope lingers.
“Are you not concerned about this development with this Raefe?” he asks. Hankori was being unusually eliptical about it.
“I am quite concerned,” Hankori said. “But I have a plan.”
“Care to share it,” Anatope asks. “We’ve been in this together for a long time.”
“And we will share a victory toast. Soon. For now, the most good you can do is to keep an eye on Aleron. She is such a foolish being. Let me know at once if you sense anything notable.”</Text>

            <Text>White Christmas
December 22, 2081

Raefe woke with a start. He could hear noises from out in the hall. It was still night, just a bit of moonlight filtering in through the small window high up on his cell wall. Now he could see dark shapes running by the small window in the cell door. He dressed quickly and stood on the wooden chair, faced pressed to the window.
The shapes were prison guards, running back and forth, yelling to each other. Between the thickness of the door and their accent, he couldn’t make out anything they were saying. He tried to read their thoughts, but they were a jumble of fear and panic and confusion. Something bad was happening, that much was sure.
“Inmates, step back from your doors,” boomed the PA speakers in the hall. He jumped down and pulled the chair back. The door popped open. “All inmates, report to the cafeteria.”
He walked down the hall, eerily reminiscent of the student housing he had briefly lived in more than 30 years ago. After a week in jail, the way to the caf was now familiar. He joined a parade of men, most of whom were grumpy about being awakened from drunken or drug-induced stupors. A few showed the ill effects of having been in a fight. Many were swearing at the absent guards. Raefe decided silence was his best option until he knew what was going on.
He felt Gordo’s thoughts reaching out to him from outside the jail.
“Are you OK?” Gordo asked. “I felt a surge from you a few minutes ago.”
“Yeah, I’m OK. We were just woken up. Something’s going on.”
“It’s the weather, it’s worsened. Maybe they’re shipping you out.”
“Where to?”
“No idea. But everyone here is ready to come help, if you need it.”
“Thanks, I’ll let you know.”
The cafeteria was dark, lit only by some kind of battery-powered emergency lights. The wall clock said 5:03 AM. There were half a dozen uniforms against one wall. Two had electroguns, the rest more lethal armaments. There were about three dozen inmates scattered around the room. A man in a suit stood on raised platform, bullhorn in hand.
“If you’ll all kindly take a seat, we’ll make this brief,” he said. “Thank you. Most of you know that the last three months have been unseasonably cold. In the last week, we are told, things have taken a turn for the worse. We’re already seeing the heaviest snows ever recorded in Scotland, and those storms are headed our way. We’re being told that within three days Newcastle will be hit by a blizzard that could last up to two weeks. Electric lines will go down, wind turbines will freeze, and solar panels will be buried. Our emergency batteries can only last for 48 hours if we have to use them.”
Faced with the prospect of a being stuck in a jail with no heat or light, the inmates started to grumble.
“We have considered evacuating the jail and moving all of you temporarily to facilities in the South. For a variety of reasons, we have decided against that. Given that all of you are here for minor offenses, and will undoubtedly give us cause to arrest you again in the future, we have gotten permission from a magistrate to release you on your own recognizance. You must, of course, show up for your trial date, but for now, you’ll be free to go. We’ve woken you up early so that you can contact friends or family to come get you. All prisoners must leave by noon today. The prison will be closed after that.”
Raefe had expected a big cheer from the other inmates, but the room was quiet. He could sense that they were uneasy, fearful of what they would be walking into outside. They grabbed breakfast rolls and coffee like they might not see food again for a week. Raefe did the same, his mind reaching out to find Gordo.
“They’re kicking us out of jail. What the hell is going on?”
“Remember that controversy a couple of months ago about whether the Gulf Stream was being submerged? Well, it’s settled. Gone diving. Ocean surface temps in the North Atlantic have dropped by more than five degrees in the last few days. And the current has reversed course — no more warm southern water bathing England. Now it’s Greenland ice melt coming south. Scotland is getting battered by 40 mile an hour winds, temps of minus 10, and now a snow storm that’s expected to last for days. Actually, no end in sight.”
“The warden or whatever he his said the storm’s headed here. I have to leave by noon.”
“We’ll send someone to meet you at the prison. They can be there by half ten. OK?”
“Can’t wait. Hey, someone’s coming. Let’s talk later.”
He saw one of the guards walking his way, not one he’d seen before.
“Miller-Epstein? Come with me.”
He followed the guard down the hall, into a small office. Another guard sat behind a desk, but a vaguely South Asian man in civilian clothes sat alongside him.
“Do you know who I am?” the man asked.
Ah, that voice, Raefe thought. I know you.
“You’re Benjamin McDornish.” Son of an Indian mother and a Northern England father. As rabid a racist as any of the snow white members of the Northern Alliance that he lead. If there were Muslim or Slav or Chinese heads to bash, you have to prove no man or woman is more enthusiastic than you, don’t you, Raefe thought. 
“Very good. Do you know why I’m here?”
To scare me, Raefe thought. To tell me that the full weight of your racist thugs will be applied if I don’t leave Newcastle by midnight. Or that you know where Lina is. Or really anything that a man desperately on the wrong side of history says to pretend that’s not true. He let McDornish’s thoughts wash over him. The man though of him as prey. Right now, he wanted to play with his catch. Raefe decided not to cooperate.
“No,” he said, keeping his voice quiet and flat.
“You’re going back out on the street in a few hours, and I want you to understand something.”
Raefe stood, silent. McDornish was going to try and goad him a few more times, he was pretty sure.
“No doubt your friends will come get you. They’ll tell you how dangerous this storm is. The storm is not your biggest problem.”
This guy has watched too many old vids, Raefe thought. He’s going to tell me he is.
“A good coat and a fireplace will save you from the storm. They won’t save you from me if I want to hurt you.”
He wanted Raefe to ask him why he would hurt him. Raefe stayed silent, his face expressionless. McDornish stood up, as if to menace Raefe, but the steam was leaking out of him now. He turned to the guard.
“Get him out of here. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, Epstein.”
The guard walked him silently back to his cell. He had nothing much to pack so he read for awhile. At 9AM, the doors all opened. He went to the intake room and reclaimed his civilian clothes and a few personal things from a clerk. He checked his coat pocket — no one had stolen his gloves or hat, thankfully. The hot water heater was already turned off, so he skipped the shower. He dressed silently, feeling the other inmate’s mix of emotions. Glad to be leaving, scared to not know why or where, putting whatever face on it their temperaments led them to. He had been kept away from them during the week, isolated. There was no one to say good bye to.
There was a vid screen in one of the guard offices. The door was open as he walked by and he stopped to watch. Somewhere north, howling winds were filling the streets with snow. Vehicles were buried, you couldn’t see more than 20 meters, and there was no one on the street. A weather map came on the screen. A huge band of white covered all of Northern England, Scotland and Ireland, extending northward almost to Iceland and eastward halfway to Denmark.
At 10:30, he buttoned up his top button and stepped out of the jail on to the street. Two of Gordo’s mates hustled him into a car and they went across the Tyne to Gateshead. They wound their way through the ruined tenements off Whitehall Street until they came to Gordo’s squat, an intact second floor flat sitting on top of a street-level that was little more than sidewalls and rubble. The insides had been torched during one of the battles between Hindu and Muslim refugees in ‘74. The usual crowd of students from the university, unemployed workers, and neighborhood toughs  seemed slightly more animated today, the threat of catastrophe pushing them out of their usual routines.
“Come on up,” he heard Gordo’s thoughts. Inside Gordo’s flat, there were piles of backpacks and supplies.
“We’re evacuating to warmer ground,” Gordo said. “This neighborhood will be buried by the blizzard and the city will leave it that way until nature melts it. We’d be buried alive if we stayed.”
“Where can we go?” Raefe asked.
“Cornwall,” Gordo answered. “The last of the Gulf Stream still reaches there. Warm winds will turn the snow to rain down there, but at least we won’t freeze to death.”
“How are we going to get over the border into the South?”
“We’re going to Liverpool. A boat will take us south of the border to Wales. There’s a large forest area, Snowdonia, used to be a park for campers and the like. There’s some people will takes through there, and then well, it’s complicated, but there are people who will get us to Cornwall.”
“You trust them not to turn us over to the corpos?”
“Don’t know much about Wales, do you?”
“Nothing,” Raefe laughed.”
“These lads, their great-grandads were thrown out of work by the first of the corpos, back in Iron Maggie’s day. Four generations is nothing at all for them to hold a grudge, especially considering the corpos in the City take ever opportunity to stick it to them. You’re safe with this lot — they’d never do anything to help the City.”
“Does Lina know the plan?”
“Yes, we’ve been  in touch. She has some ideas she wants to discuss with you, so whenever you get the chance…”
“Right. When we’re on the road.”
“Perfect. Grab some kit — we need to get out of here while we can.”
Gordo had kept Raefe’s clothes and puter while he was in the slammer. Someone had put them in a pack, along with winter gear and some food. He put the coat and the pack on and grabbed some boxes of food. There were about twenty people packing three good-sized box trucks with Northern Electric written on the side. Gordo laughed at Raefe’s puzzled expression.
“We’ve got a rental agreement,” Gordo said. “Very low rate. Gives us a ready reason to be on the road. You’ll be in that truck, with Claire. She actually does worth for Northern and knows the drill, so she’ll do all the talking if it comes to that.”
Raefe walked over to the truck Gordo had indicated.
“Where do you want the food,” he asked Claire, a short, very dark skinned woman who looked to be about 35.
It sounded like she answered “All the way up front,” her thick Scots accent turning the words into taffy.
“And me?”
“You stay in the back until we get near Leeds. Can’t have McDornish’s men spotting you around here. We’ll switch off after that.”
There were six of them in the back, sandwiched between the food up front and boxes of spare parts for wind turbines in the back. They’d pass no more than a cursory inspection if it came to that. Someone outside pulled the truck door down and the inside went dark. Claire started the motors, and they were off, bouncing down the rough streets. He heard a voice talking quietly on a mobile and the interior lights went on.


Claire had pulled down a side road into an old abandoned barn. She opened the back door.
“Right, your with me,” she said, pointing to Raefe.
They pulled back on the main road. The snows hadn’t reached here yet, but the traffic was very light.
“Where are the other two trucks?” he asked.
“Gone different routes,” she said. “Better that way, draws less attention. No reason for three trucks to be heading away from an emergency.”
He touched her mind lightly. She hadn’t learned to entangle, maybe she never would. He could sense that she was calm, used to dodgey circumstances.
“You really work for the electric company?” he asked.
“When there’s work, yeah. Northern England’s a bit of a part time affair, you know.”
“But you’re from Scotland?”
“Aye, born and raised. Me dad was a tidal power engineer in South Africa. During the civil war there, he went to Scotland to catch on at one of the island power stations. He met me mom there — she was a clerk up from Glasgow to do the accounting and such.”
“So you grew up on one of those remote little islands?”
“Was born there, but they went back to Glasgow after a hurricane wrecked the plant. Was hard times for them, and me, in the rough part of Glasgow.”
“And from Glasgow to Newcastle?” he asked.
“Bad judgment.”
“How so?”
“Let’s just say I never felt at home in Glasgow. Even the way I talk, people still would ask me where I was from. Ask any black Scot, you’ll hear the same. Some go all the way back hundreds of years there, too, but no mind. Even the posh ones. Never had our own tartan, I guess.”
“No better in Northern England, is it?”
“Worse. But I was fooled by all that talk when the Northern Brigades rebelled against the City. They sounded like proper revolutionaries to me, out with the old and all that. Sounded good. Was good, for a little while. Then it was, the North for Northerners, even if half of them are Hindus now. And I was back to where was you born? Maybe if I was a little lighter and had a different face, I could have passed for a Hindu, but they saw me and I was nothing but an African here to take what jobs they still had.”
“This island is like America, that way,” he said. “There was no one here at all thousands of years ago — The whole place was a hundred feet of solid ice. Like maybe Scotland will be hundreds of years from now, the way things are going. Everyone came here from somewhere else. And it’s just a shouting match about who’s here the longest, who’s the true Brits and so on. America’s the same — the only true Americans are mostly gone and everyone else thinks a few generations qualifies them.”
“Indeed. You think it will ever change?”
“Has to,” he said. “Change or die, those are the choices.”
“But how? I see them risk their lives for McDornish and his bunch. And all they get out of it is what they call Northern Pride. How do you fight that?”
“Anyway we can,” he said. “Any way we can get people to see that we can only survive the world we’ve made by banding together and making it right again.”
“But what’s your plan? We’re risking our lives to get you South. When we get you there, what will you do to make me feel I risked my life for a good reason?”
“You already answered that. You’ve been risking your life for years, just trying to walk down the street. There is no God or Jesus or Vishnu or whomever who is going to lead us out of this wilderness. There’s just us. And there’s a lot of us, most of us, even, everywhere. Many ideas about the future. We’ll all figure it out, bit by bit.”
He could see that she wasn’t persuaded.
“You want me to tell you that if we do such and such, in a few years, this will all be over and life will be great?”
“That would be nice,” she said. “You think I’m stupid to want that?”
“To want that?” he said. “No, who wouldn’t want that? To believe that there’s a shortcut to that, that might be stupid. Your father’s country, they fought for four or five generations just to get the right for a black person to sit next to a white person in public. We have a whole world to change.”
“What makes you think we’ll do better than my father’s country?”
“Because they thought it was just a matter of taking from the people who took from them. Actually, they took some of the first steps on the road we’re on, letting the old oppressors own up to their sins and then accepting them back into society. Take McDornish’s gang — say we somehow could kill all of them. But they have families, friends who then will hate us and we’ll never end that cycle of victor and vanquished. Most of them are no different than this lot — people with their backs up against it.”
“I’m not like them,” she said, her face cloudy with anger.
“No, you’re not,” he said. “Now. But like you said, they seemed righteous when they started. But they forgot something.”
“What?”
“That the point of fighting is not destroying your opponent. It’s changing what made you need to fight. It’s finding the connection that binds, not cleaves. Do  children play the game of musical chairs here?”
“Yes,” she smiled. 
“Life cannot just be a game of musical chairs, don’t you think? People didn’t struggle for thousands of years to make a better life just to turn it into a game of winners and losers, more and more losing until there’s just a few winners.”
“But that’s human nature, isn’t it?”
“Ah, but which human nature? The human nature of the first people who figured out how to make a fire, or a bow and arrow, and showed everyone else how to do it, gladly and for free? Or the human nature of the drug corpos, who get uni students to discover life saving drugs for next to nothing, than want to patent them so only those who can pay can have it? What we call human nature isn’t really natural. You can’t find any other animals that are willing to kill half of their own kind.”
“So back to nature, is it? A dogs life. I didn’t have you figured for a back to nature type. More like one of them teachers at the uni, what I heard.”
He smiled. “Maybe I think we should go forward to nature, not back. I just feel it in people, that they could live without fear and hatred and violence, but they can’t figure out how. I just want us to give it a go, to try, before we finally top ourselves as a species.”
“Yeah, okay, I can respect that. Still, you might need a hard girl like me along the way, right?” she said, grinning at him.
“Yeah, probably,” he laughed. “Then we’ll have to figure out how to soften you up.”

            <Text>Tribal news
Traveller’s Perch
January 20, 2099
Even 20 light years away, Raefe’s sadness weighed heavily on Far Flier. Unlike the humans, her species had nothing like crying, no cathartic release of emotions. Yet her limbs felt heavy. She imagined that this feeling kept her airborne ancestors from taking flight, keeping them hidden in nooks and crannies on the high cliffs until the feeling passed, until they felt confident enough to soar out into the open air. And here she was, she might as well be hidden in her quarters in this sparsely settled quarter of Traveller’s Perch, far from the Guardian complex, far even from her lover Diver’s quarters. 
That had been Far Flier’s idea. In the wake of the Warren cabal’s defeat on Earth, Adno had exposed Hankori’s role. But Adno had underestimated the rot that infected the Guardian Council. While Green and others had, at the last minute, helped sabotage Hankori’s plans, they remained aligned with him. Fundamentally, they liked his immortality plan, just not him. During the crisis, Adno had won their help in undoing the plot and she had expected that afterwards, they would collaborate in removing Hankori. Instead, they had used their knowledge of Hankori’s plans to force him to share greater power with them. Far Flier had become their scapegoat, Adno next down the list of those who would be blamed. So she had made a public show of distancing herself from Diver to spare her from retribution. At first Diver had been hurt, but they had resumed their life together out of the spotlight, and Diver had come to understand that for the moment they had little choice but to fly this path inside the clouds.
So it was Flier who took the risks to tangle with the Earthers, although it was often using the wavelengths and techniques that Adno had taught them. In their arrogance, the Guardian Council had not bothered to learn these methods, thinking Flier and her allies now irrelevant. She would use the same wavelengths later in the day to tangle with Diver and let her feel what Raefe was going through. But there seemed little they could do about it for the moment.
“Still, I must try,” she felt Diver say, her thoughts coming as a surprise. “I cannot do nothing.”
“You were listening? I did not sense you,” Far Flier said.
“You forget that I was the first to entangle with Raefe,” Diver said. “Even now, he does not always know how to control his thoughts in the waveform. The pathways that Adno showed us often contain his mind reaching out to connect to all sorts of people. I usually ignore it, but you, too, could feel how obviously distressed he his. It was me who set him on this path. As a Guardian, I cannot help him. As a person, I must.”
This was the Diver she had always loved. Still, she worried.
“And as a Guardian, you must not do too much” she said, more of a request than a question. “Intervening has its own perils.”
“If I were rescuing a person in a burning building, you wouldn’t warn me that they might fall off a cliff next year.”
“True. But what if they believed that their whole town was responsible for the fire and then tried to kill them all?”
“What if, what if. What if they were going to make a great discovery had they lived? Two can play that game.”
Flier felt her ferocity and was hurt by it.  
“You are right,” she said. “You are saying that we should choose life when we have the chance. In time, you will see that I am not just being an old woman about this — the path you are considering is not always safe. But what is, I suppose? You will be careful?”
“Always,” Diver responded. 
Flier sighed. “Well, then, good luck.”
*****
It had been almost 20 years since Diver had been stripped of her ambassadorship. Since then, she had been reassigned to a variety of minor duties within the Guardian organization. Really, what were the major duties for the Guardians anymore? Other than Hankori’s team working on his immortality project, no one seemed very interested in searching for new species, or even keeping up with the dozen or so on their watch list. If Adno’s people weren’t continuing to do that on their own, Diver doubted it would be happening at all. Her only consolation for her separation from  Anti and Mari, their children, was that at least they were still helping Adno’s school in their secret work as unofficial ambassadors.
She needed to talk to Mari. It wasn’t hard to find her in the waveform.
“Mom, is something wrong?”
“No. And yes,” Diver said. “Not with me or Flier. Well, no more than the usual. But Raefe…”
“Yes, I felt it too,” Mari said. “He grows weak in his resolve.”
“True,” she said, “but that’s not  what’s bothering me. He’s old, you know. Humans are short-lived. You have not known anyone who has died — it’s so rare among us. But with them, they can see the end. They are tired, but sometimes they also relax. Think of how you feel when you take a long flight over the water and can see land on your way back.”
“Ah, I see what you mean,” Mari said. “Sometimes I just let the winds glide me back, even if it takes a bit longer. After a long trip, what’s a few more minutes?”
“Yes, it must be something like that,” Diver said. “Not that I would really know either. But I have watched them for a long time, and I have seen it happen in other humans as well.”
“There’s not much you can do about it, is there?”
“Him growing old? Not unless I want to repeat Hankori’s plot with Everywhere, no. But that’s not what’s bothering me about Raefe. I believe that he is disheartened for another reason. He has lost belief that humans can change. He doesn’t know it yet, but that idea is starting to bubble up inside him and that dawning awareness is beginning to crush him. His empathic abilities have always had a downside — depression — and I fear he will spend his remaining days overcome by it.”
“Ay! That would be so tragic, in so many ways. Do you see a way out?”
“I wish I did. I have not entangled fully with him since returning to Traveller’s Perch. I known only what leaks into the waveform, not his full mind. I don’t really know what the knot of it is.”
“Are you thinking of contacting him?”
Diver sighed. “I’m thinking of it. I guess that was what I needed to talk with you about. Am I crazy?”
“Of course! You love to dive off cliffs and hunt your own food,” Mari said, letting Diver  feel her smile. “And your idea of being sane is asking your exiled daughter, who flies as a scout for a giant school of marine people on a world with only one small island, if this is a good idea. We both know that you will fly this path, that you only search for the best currents to glide on.”
Diver laughed for the first time in awhile. “How did I wind up with such a smart daughter! I will not speak of this lightly though. Don’t worry if you don’t hear me mention it.”
“Understood. Please give father mother my love.”
“And you to Anti. But I think it best you not speak of this to Adno. She would only want to help and I don’t want her to risk that.”
*****
Diver lay in their bed, curled in a semicircle opposite Flier, who was still asleep. Several days had passed since her talk with Mari. Contrary to her daughter’s image of her, Diver had become quite cautious in the wake of all that had happened. She felt the long, calm energy of Flier, even in sleep. Flier had lived nearly three times longer than her, and in those 800 additional years had reached the pinnacle of their society, been cast down unfairly, changed sex and given birth. Diver thought that the last 20 years must have felt like diving from the highest cliff on Traveller’s Perch and seeing nothing but rocks below. Yet if Flier seemed often sad and a bit aimless, she also seemed to have gained an inner steadiness. She wished deeply that Flier had a purpose to put that steadiness to. Flier had been her guide star in the night and she wished that it was still so, that they could return to those days of purpose and adventure.
But she would have to find her own way on this journey. She would tell Flier soon enough, but only when she had made sense of what came next. She let Flier sleep and rose quietly. It was time.
She walked out of their door, down the small path that wound through their little village. No one else here had anything to do with the Guardians. They mostly worked in the small fruit growing farms on the hillside, minding the genetics, monitoring the robot pickers, checking whether the farm was unduly influencing the wild surroundings. Flier had become interested in that and some days she volunteered to wander the area, looking for signs of disruption. As a result, Flier had learned of many wonderful little nooks and crannies of the region that were rarely frequented and she often like to hike with Diver to them.
But today she didn’t have the patience for a long hike. She stopped at Cliff Nest’s small restaurant where their lane joined the main path through the village and had a quick breakfast of berry tea and some melon steaks.
“Off to work?’ Cliff Nest asked.
“Not today,” Diver replied. “Off for a fly. Heard anything about the winds?”
“Yes, good today,” he said. “Just one sun this morning. Steady off the water, deep into the hills. Want something for later?”
She thought of using her enhancements to synthesize energy from the gravity field, but thought the better of it. She would do it the old way. It was probably nonsense, but sometimes she felt it was easier to empathize with Raefe if she kept things closer to his way of life.
“That would be nice. Just a little something for the trip.”
He gave her some dried fruits and some smoked fish for her lunch. She slid them into the pouch in her flight suit and walked off to her favorite launch point, a large boulder on top of the biggest hill outside the village. Her mind was clear now. She could even feel the simple thoughts of her ancient bird cousins as they glided on the winds around the village. Soon she was among them, feeling the warmth of Prime on her back and the steady push of a thermal as she left the village at her tail and headed inland, past the farms, toward the wilds. She could feel other people working in the orchards and kept going until she felt no more minds nearby.
She found a natural grove just inside the wilds. A circle of large boulders stood in the middle of a thick stand of fruit trees that were being rested from cultivation. No one was allowed in the wilds unless they had a purpose like Flier’s inspections, but this was close enough to give her privacy. And, she realized, a kind of peace of mind. She wanted that for her time with Raefe.
She remembered her training, settling her mind, her breathing, finding the doors in her mind, opening them up to feel the energy of life. She let it wash over her, life a warm rain on her feathers, washing away the grime, letting her colors shine, but more importantly, allowing her to be more accepting. It wasn’t hard to find him, like seeing an old friend in a crowd. She hesitated, wondering if he would know her after all of these years. Would he be angry that she had never contacted him after Hankori’s plot failed? She sighed, thinking there was only one way to find out. She let her mind flow out  into the waveform and touch his.
“Hello, old friend,” she said.
“Is that…” he began to ask.
“Yes, your old Martian friend,” she said. Her paranoia wanted him to not say her name, nor she his, and so she alluded to the Mars Girl personna she had first used with him, hoping he would remember.
“I don’t know what to say,” he said. “I had forgotten what your mind is like. Are you well?”
“Much like you, I suspect,” she answered. “Life can be complicated.”
“Ah, I see,” he said, and she could feel that he had absorbed the subtext of her comment. “Complicated indeed. But here we are, me an old man and you, perhaps at loose ends.”
What a quaint phrase, she thought. She had forgotten that humans like things “tied up,” not too loose. She’d have thought that their short lives would lead to the opposite conclusion. After all, very little could happen in the 70 or so years they lived that would be definite — it would all ebb and flow, twist and turn, for centuries. Even for her people, change was a series of shifting tides, as she had found out.
“Perceptive as always, my old friend,” she said. “Things have been difficult here — I think you know some of the story and it hasn’t changed that much. Most of your old friends here have, to use your phrase, been fired. And the new management isn’t interested in your project, if you catch my meaning.”
“I can feel your caution, so I will not ask for details, although part of me wants to know where the hell you have been for the last 20 years. So I will only ask, what brings you to this moment?”
Why am I contacting you, that’s what you want to know, she realized, and I don’t really know. She dug deep and opened herself partly to him, letting him feel that she was saddened by his despair, by the prospect that he might die soon, and that she would have sent him down this path and then left him to find his own way. But he should know, even if they had been in touch daily, she would never have been able to hold his hand throughout the entire process. Still, she was a bad friend to him, she realized, to have not given him at least emotional support.
“I can’t say I haven’t missed out chats,” he replied, “and Lina has too. In truth, I have had all the emotional support a man could want from her and my wonderful children and so many people in Everywhere. You know what that the Citizens of Everywhere are, right?”
She was embarrassed that he would even ask. “Yes, our watery friend kept me informed about your doings back then. We were both very impressed.”
“I think we were all so impressed that we pulled it off, that we thought it would sweep the globe like a warm breeze, gently moving everything in its path. Like some benevolent magnetic field aligning everyone. Instead, we seem to have stalled out. And meanwhile, our climate crisis deepens, and with it, the human toll mounts. And with that, empathy sometimes seems too much to ask. Just this week, my greatest accomplishment was in getting some people not to kill others. Not to stop hating, not to stop depriving others of food or water or shelter — just the most basic don’t kill them. That’s what it’s come to.”
She felt his memories of what he was referring to and she could see that he had felt like a man standing on a slippery rock in the middle of a raging river, hoping not to be swept this way or that by the current. And that it had left him profoundly weary.
“You are so strong!” she said. “When you see yourself surrounded by raging waters that threaten you on all sides, also remember that you have parted those waters, made them flow around you. Not just you, but all of you in Everywhere and all those who are doing similar things.”
“You take such a long view,” he said. “Even on the days when I feel like a rock, I’m aware of the water wearing me down. Someday I will be sand, dissolved in the river. Do you know what that feels like?”
He had never asked her that question before. She was always the teacher, he the student.
“No,” she said, “you are right. I have much to learn from you, I see now. Because here too we have had humbling experiences, we are dealing with some of the same forces. Not on the scale and scope, not as dominant across our worlds. But we are, I fear, even less prepared than you feel, because we had long deluded ourselves that the past was dead and buried. Yet here we are, among my people, facing corruption and the threat of being caught up in totally insane schemes. Things do move slower here, so we have time to learn, time to repair.”
“I had no idea,” he said. “I thought you had just lost interest in our silly little world. Adno tried to explain it all to us, but we weren’t that interested, I have to say. Problems of our own, I guess. It’s hard to empathize with people you’ve never seen or touched, people who are just a dream that happens when you’re awake.”
“Yes, it is,” she said. “It has been for all people we have ever met, on any planet. Maybe it’s not an ironclad rule, but all intelligent life we have found has evolved to deal the world in front of it. Yes, we can imagine, we can conjure up images, write equations that describe things. But we live in the world in front of us, more than anything, I guess.”
“Do we? I talk to people every day who don’t want to live in the world in front of them. They want to live in a world that probably never existed, a world they imagine that happened before they were born, or in a world that will never happen.”
A world that will never happen, she thought, isn’t that where Hankori is taking us?
“Impossible dreams, yes, we have them, too, that also distract from our real tasks” she said to Raefe. “If Far Flier were with us, I know he would have something very wise to say about that. He’s 1,200 years old, you know. Gives you a lot of perspective. And now it is me who realizes how I have missed our little chats. Your species has much less time than mine for self delusion — urgency can clarify. Maybe we can find our ways together?”
She felt him startle.
“I have no idea of how I can help you,” he said, “but if you think so…”
“More like I feel so,” she said. “I think we worry so much that we’ll give you some technical secret you’re world is not ready to handle that we forget that you are intelligent, living beings who have your own perspective. Not more or less, just different. And difference always holds the promise of revelation.”
She realized that she had not yet come to see humans as fully intelligent. She had been so enthusiastic about their potential that she had failed to appreciate that the gap between their worlds was great, yes, seen from a certain perspective. But small, as well, when you looked at it from another side. Wasn’t that the lesson of Hankori’s treachery? And if that was true, were the Guardians over-cautious in helping people like the humans? She was going to test this boundary.
“Listen, old friend, perhaps the time has come to talk less in riddles,” she said, “and more in practical terms.”
“I’m all ears,” he said.
“You are struggling with the fact that the wave of empathy you helped unleash did not transform everyone on Earth into an empath. Probably I helped give you the impression that it would, because I am only now coming to see what it means that your lives are so much shorter than ours. My enhancements tell me that it was about 500 years ago that humans first crystallized what you call science. And that was after centuries of increasing interest in rational thought — learning to use observation and then mathematics to understand things, to make new things. Am I right?”
“Yes, I think you are thinking of Galileo,” he said. “But it’s more complex, don’t you think? Science did sweep the globe, leading to industry, leading to carbon overload. And yet, it was also refusal to believe science that kept us from changing things in time.”
“Far Flier and I talked about this when you and I first met. Your species is unusual. Most species become more advanced emotionally before they make the kind of progress you have made through rational inquiry. So your species has a lot of odd ideas about owning nature, owning people, or at least their time.”
“So those are not universal ideas?” he asked, genuinely surprised. 
“Not as far as I know,” she said. “It’s a big galaxy, so I doubt you’re alone in that. But of the Guardian species, none evolved that way. Maybe you are the Galileo of empathy,” she laughed. She could feel his discomfort at being put on such a pedestal.
“Well, I imagine there are people who would like to burn me at the stake” he said. “I know you are trying to cheer me up here, to be helpful. But I still don’t understand what it is you think I can do about all of this. After almost 50 years, I’m out of ideas. Maybe it’s someone else’s time.”
“I’m sure it’s many other people’s time, don’t you think?” she said. “Time to do what, though, that’s the question. If you could just make it so, what would you want to see happen?”
“Huh,” he grunted. “Maybe that’s the problem. We’ve stopped asking that, we’ve been so consumed by staying alive. Now I think I need to remember why.”
*****
Flier had felt Diver approaching her quarters and reached out. She made no attempt to shield her feelings. She felt Diver’s frustration and confusion, but also her determination to help Raefe.
“Tough conversation, eh?” she said as Diver walked through the doorway.
“I suppose so,” she said. “I’m wrestling with what to make of it.”
Diver gave Flier her memory of it.
“Not the Raefe I remember,” Flier said.
“How so?” she asked.
“He always felt so innocent to me, somewhat childlike. I mean like one of our children, in their first few decades.”
“And now?”
“Well, I don’t think I have much to compare him to. He would still be a young person in our culture, but he’s an elder in theirs.”
“Like you,” she pointed out.
“Huh,” Flier said, “I suppose that’s true. Does he remind you of me?”
“No, not at all,” she said. “You always seem to find an answer. You have this deep knowledge of history that seems to help you put things in perspective. He’s trying to rewrite history and he has really nothing to go on. Except that we told him he could.”
“Well, he can, don’t you think? When he brought those 10,000 people together to form Nowhere, nothing like that had ever happened on Earth. And it wasn’t just that — forming this web of empaths, he did that. Earth will never be the same.”
“But he won’t live 2,000 years to see that. I think we forgot that part.”
“Perhaps you’re right. Neither of us has ever lived in a world where people die so quickly. What do you think it means?”
“I’m not sure. But I feel like it might mean that we have been to cautious, too withholding. How will humans advance if they can make so little progress in each generation? All it will take is one or two generations of backsliding and they could be in grave danger of extinction.”
“That has always been true. It has never been our role to rescue, just to guide.”
“I reject that as a principle. Sure, that’s a nice idea. But you can’t guide someone if they die because you refused to rescue them when they asked. And they want guidance, too! He wants to understand, I’m sure many others like him do, too.”
“You think we should get more involved, eh?”
“I’m mulling it over.”
“How would we be different than Hankori if we did?”
“Because we would be helping them to advance, all of them. Not just experimenting on a select few for our own ends.”
“That seems clear, but is it always?”
“No, I agree. But can we say that choosing life is better than not? If not, what is it that we are actually about? What good is our empathy if not in the service of life?”
“I admit, you have me there,” Flier said. “Still, I don’t understand what it is you actually want to do to help him.”
“I don’t either,” she said. “But I want to figure that out, and I want your help.”
Flier was touched. “I will find it hard to refuse. I have been of no help to anyone for 20 years.”
Diver softened. “Do not mistake my passion for the humans with anger for you. You have always been the rock from which I launch into the winds and to which I return to land. I am only asking for the benefit of your many years of experience and your deep knowledge of what Guardians have done through the ages.”
“And you will have it,” Flier said, letting Diver’s words hum in her chest in a way that sounded much like her mating call. She was happy to see Diver smile.

            <Synopsis>Aleron informs the Guardians of Raefe's progress.
Salmerikon visits Aleron. They mate.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The focus shifted to Aleron. She felt the overlapping waves of the committee, the patterns of interest, skepticism, affection, hostility. She let her report flow calmly.
&quot;Ordinarily, I would have told you about the steady progress we’ve made with the People. You all know that we had shifted a promising receptee, Raefe, into a new timeline to prolong his development. But unexpected events have just recently taken place that put the whole situation into a different phase.”
She gave them her memories of some of her discussions with Raefe.
“So he is near death?” Hankori asked.
“Fortunately, no. He was, in fact, able to contact another promising candidate, Alton Winchester. He’s not as far along, and so all Raefe could do was get Alton’s mind thinking about the situation, and Alton took it from there. He organized a rescue and got medical care for Raefe.”
“Will he return to normal?” Anatope asked.
Aleron smiled. “He will return to better than normal. I’ve received an extensive analysis from our medical programs. I won’t bore you with the details of human physiology, but the conflict triggered an intense burst of hormones that  initiated a series of subtle transformations. In short, Raefe’s ability to entangle has increased by an order of magnitude.”
“Well, we are glad your charge has not died on you,” Hankori said. “But I think this shows that despite your best efforts, these People can do nothing but harm themselves and each other.”
“You are quick to judge,” Salmerikon said. “Let her finish her report.”
 “You are right, Hankori,” Aleron said. “Human society is what you say. It is a long time since you were an ambassador like me. I fear you have forgotten that every society stuck on the brink of self destruction is like them. Including the ones that ultimately cross that threshold and never look back.”
“Yes, yes, that is always your answer,” Hankori said. “We did it, others will follow. What evidence do you have?”
“Evidence? How legalistic of you,” Aleron said. “Perhaps do remember well ancient societies, with their endless litigous debates that never seem to care about the truth. I am only giving a report, not evidence. But I will report this: The first thing he did with his new powers was reach and spontaneously entangle with his mate, attempting to heal her wounded psyche.”
This was what they Guarded for, these moments of hope that they could build on. But she could feel unconvinced opposition in their wave function.
&quot;Since your intervention, this one has made strides,” Hanakori conceded. “But he is one of 9 billion. And he has taken baby steps and very slow ones at that.” 
&quot;It seems slower to us than it does to him,&quot; Aleron replied, acknowledging while contradicting. &quot;The more I entangle with them, the more I see the imbalance between their rational and emotional lives, and the consequent slowness with which they come to grasp new ways.&quot;
&quot;Precisely. And yet they are near the brink again, in his new world. Which makes me wonder why we continue with this Earth,&quot; said Anatope. Aleron was not surprised. He and Hanakori had long been impatient with what they saw as lost causes.
&quot;But they are making progress,&quot; she insisted. &quot;We have seen this before. About 10 of their generations ago, their urbanization process threatened to kill them off in waves of disease. They had no understanding of their own biology. Their medicine was based either on superstition or trial and error. Yet within three generations, they solved the riddle of bacteria, the major threat to them, and have ever since been gradually spreading new practices throughout their societies. And we have other examples. This species seems to work fastest when time is shortest.&quot;
&quot;I don't see it that way,&quot; Hanakori replied. &quot;They are a classic case of a society stuck in the Optimization phase. They have learned much about the physical world, and most of them are in love with the notion that there is a physical answer to every problem. The only significant agents of progress in their society favor more technology, their opponents less or just different technology. At the same time, many of them still engage in magical thinking, refusing to face facts.&quot;
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Anatope said. &quot;They have made little progress in understanding their own inner workings and how their minds interact with these changes they are constantly implementing. And what progress they have made seems entirely focused on each individual. From your reports, I see no evidence that they have come to understand in any deep way how their individual natures, small group natures, big group behavior, and species behavior interact. They constantly replicate mistakes of the past, each time with more optimized technology. We know this is the path to self-destruction.&quot;
&quot;Yes, we do,&quot; Aleron agreed. &quot;If it were not true, we would have no mission there. But now we have a catalyst in Raefe, and a other promising individuals who are only slightly behind him, who are beginning to break through to a new paradigm. We have succeeded with such allies before with other species, many times. The simulations still allow for a reasonable chance of success.  I ask only for patience.&quot;
&quot;You ask for more,&quot; Anatope responded instantly, as if waiting to pounce. &quot;You ask for energy to maintain the entanglement, indeed for more and more to spread it. You ask for more Guardians.&quot;
&quot;I ask what all Guardians have always asked for,&quot; she replied. &quot;That we spend our time and energy as needed to save life and nurture it to sustainability. What better use do we have for our time and energy?&quot;
She was puzzled. Once again she had felt the hard edge of judgment from Hankori's cohort. They often came dangerously close to talking about &quot;worthy&quot; species, an idea she thought the very opposite of what being a Guardian was. It was an old idea that plagued many advanced species, who found it hard to resist looking at intelligent life that was millennia behind them in development as pets, or worse, garden plants, to be tended until they became boring, or worse still, pests to be eliminated. Shedding that notion was one of the key steps to becoming a Guardian species, but it was never shed all at once, or for all time.
But Anatope's bunch had never made an argument based on resources. Why now? Her effort with the People was one of thousands underway by hundreds of Guardians, each of which consumed a relatively small part of the energy they were able to extract from the vacuum. Why pick on her or her project?
Even as she pondered this, she could feel a shift in the wave function.  Salmerikon, always encouraging her, now felt stern. But she could feel Anatope shrink, too, from him.
&quot;We are not here to debate whether we are Guardians,&quot; Salmerikon said flatly. &quot;We are only ambassadors, and we must carry out the will of all of our kind to be Guardians. Anatope, Hanakori, you are free to raise the wisdom of guardianship with the Whole. In the meantime, our choices with any species we are Guarding are limited to how we may help them, not whether. And now I think there are others who have news to report, as well.&quot;

            <Title>Des learns more about sec plan</Title>
            <Text>Raefe had been wandering around Porter Square for a few hours, taking stock of how things were going. The weather had been benevolent for the last few weeks. People had finally finished cleaning up from the last hurricane and were enjoying the brief spring that would soon give way to the heat and humidity of the long summer. But it was nice to feel that life was just burbling along, that there were no disasters to prepare for and no crises to attend to.
He bought a tea from Tommie’s cart and a burrito from the Salvadorean stand near the old subway station and headed back to Tosh’s apartment. He climbed the stairs up to the third floor. Unusually, he could hear people talking and laughing as approached the door. Tosh rarely had visitors during the day. He could feel it was someone he knew, but couldn’t quite place it. No point in trying, two more steps and he’d see them.
He opened the door and Des was standing in the middle of the kitchen, regaling Tosh with some story.
“Hey, look what the cat dragged in,” Tosh said. “Why didn’t you tell me Des was coming?”
“Probably because I didn’t know,” Raefe said, smiling. And he hugged Des. As they embraced, he could feel Des’s thoughts: they had to talk, soon, but not here. And he knew it was probably not good news. But he sat and ate his burrito, and made small talk with Des and Tosh. No need to set off alarm bells with Tosh, which would set off alarm bells with the core group that kept things together in this part of Cambridge, which would, well it was just better that they keep things on the downs.
So they waited until the food was done, the tea drunk, the small talk spent. He offered to give Des a tour of the Norcamb yards, so he could see what had come of the standoff with New Kendall over the killings. They started down Mass Ave. toward the yards, waiting until they were a safe distance from Tosh, just in case he was listening and their thoughts leaked a bit.
“So I think I understand what New Kendall has going on,” Des said. “It’s a bit shocking and I didn’t think you’d want half of Cambridge to know, just yet. In a way, it’s my fault.”
“Good thinking,” Raefe asked. “But why do you think it’s your fault?”
“Well, all these years, I’ve been experimenting with using my abilities to tap into the waveform to navigate the quantum fields in computer networks. That was how I stopped old man Robertson back in ‘82.”
“And now New Kendall can do that, too?”
“No, but apparently they spent a lot of time analyzing how their network was compromised. And they seem to have come to the conclusion that what we do when we entangle somehow involves electronics.”
“But that makes no sense. Old man Robertson was directly in touch with the Guardians. He would have known that there was more too it than just some gadget.”
“But did he tell anyone that?”
“Oh, good question,” Raefe realized. “I could see that he might tell young Kenny, hoping that he would be able to get future help from the Guardians. But why would Junior tell anyone? He would want people to think he’s the special source of all power, not some aliens light years away. But OK, so they don’t get it. So what?”
“Well, their obsession with finding how we do it did yield some results. After all, if I managed to tangle with electronic fields, that tells us that once you can establish entanglement, by any means, you may be able to then manipulate those connections in various ways. And that’s what they’ve done. They’ve found an way to decohere our entanglements, that’s how their helmets work. They inject massive amounts of quantum noise into the waveform. Theoretically, we could still entangle with someone wearing one of their helmets, but our poor little brains would collapse trying to make sense out of it. It would be like trying to listen to a whisper in a thunderstorm.”
“Interesting. I wonder if we could learn to recognize any signature in their noise that we could then learn to ignore.”
“I wonder that, too,” Des said. “Probably, but I don’t think it will be quick or easy to get there.”
And Des explained that the noise wasn’t just a nuisance. It was patterned to actively disrupt their abilities. Engaging with it would be painful, exhausting.
“And they have a second version of this device which generates much louder psychic noise,” Des continued.
“Ah, the weapon they’re banking on.”
“Exactly,” Des said. “But here’s the curious thing. During all of this, they’ve never actually understood that our thoughts ride on the waveform. They think we do it all ourselves. They think we’re some kind of flashlights that beam invisible rays at each other.”
“Rather than creating fluctuations in a tiny part of the ‘flashlight’ that shines everywhere.”
“Exactly. I don’t think I ever fully grasped that until I could see what they did and how it differs from what we do. And I think I finally understand something about the waveform that the Guardians didn’t tell us. The waveform has been here since the Big Bang. The Big Bang rang all the matter in the universe like a giant bell, and it’s been vibrating ever since. We are just using those vibrations like a giant carrier wave.”
“Why is that important in this context?” Raefe asked.
“Because the waveform is like any other wave — it has harmonics, octaves, reflections, interference patterns.”
“Meaning?”
“It’s not one thing. It’s a bit like a chorus. There’s a melody, but many of the singers are singing a harmony. If you know the harmony and you know how it relates to the melody, then you can recreate the melody just from the harmony.”
“So we could ‘sing harmony,’ you’re saying, if we learned this trick of translating it to the melody, and they would never know?”
“Yes, I think so,” Des said. “I think we could also learn to sing the melody higher or lower, to continue the analogy. Their weapon wouldn’t work if we weren’t entangled on the part of the waveform they thought we were. We might even be clever enough to penetrate their helmets and read their thoughts if we did it right.”
“But you’re talking about training millions and millions of people to tangle a new way. It’s taken almost 30 years to get this far — we’d be risking everything. And couldn’t they just change their devices to adjust? Maybe make them auto-tune to our minds?”
“Maybe, it’s a fair question. But I have to think that there’s more here that we’re not seeing yet. Wouldn’t the Guardians have faced the same threats in the past?”
“You’d think, but I don’t know. And I don’t know if we’ll ever know.”
“Yeah, it’s been years since they’ve contacted us. I think we’re going to have to figure this out on our own. And soon.”
“I agree. Drop whatever else you’re doing. And if you need help, ask for it. Quietly, though.”
They had reached the old bus yard. Raefe showed Des how they were using the waste from the Boston towers to create a kind of concrete and dirt plateau. Later, they would build small houses on it for some of the fugees. It would stay above water for at least another 100 years, given the current warming trends. If somehow mankind managed to get its act together, maybe 1,000 years.
“Well, I’ll head back tomorrow,” Des said. “With any luck, things like this bus yard project will return to being our biggest worry in a few months.”
If only, Raefe thought, keeping it to himself. Why rain on the little shred of optimism in Des’s voice?</Text>
            <Notes>Des learns that NK is developing electronic technology that can detect and imitate tangling. They plan to weaponize it, which is why they were building the helmets to block signals, to protect their soldiers from this weapon.

He tells Raefe. Des thinks it may not work, it’s a fantasy. NK doesn’t  understand what the waveform really is. Des is starting to understand it a little more — it’s based on the big bang, an echo that everything since resonates in some way with.</Notes>

            <Text>Flying solo
Aleron was excited  this morning. She had made up her mind about Raefe. And she was going to fly.  
Most people on A’Nonto cherished their distant past as partially airborne creatures, but she was one of the few A’Mopto who had learned to use their enhancements to actually ride the air currents high above the canyons as their more avian ancestors had done naturally. People who didn’t hadn’t experienced the unenhanced lives of other species thought her foolish or eccentric. But  ambassadors often cherished the rawness of such experiences, the sheer physicality of them.
She felt her body generating her morning nutrients and suppressed them — she had other plans for food today. She ordered the room to open the front wall and reshape it into a balcony. She looked out over the canyons hundreds of meters below, still flooded to remind everyone of  A’Mopto’s last brush with environmental suicide 10,000 years ago. A breeze brought the first hint of warmth from Prime’s dawn to her face, and decorated the water with a dance of foam, pink in the sun’s rising red light. Higher in the sky, the Twins still shined like orange eyes against the black of space. Prime’s other two planets,  B’Nonte and C’Noono, were on the other side of A’Mopto this morning. Soon they would perform their complex dance across the day, the changing light powering the thermal cycle that all life on the planet lived by. 
She smiled, thinking of the stories the ancients had about their sky. Prime was Mother, and the Twins were First Father and Second Father. The planets were their children. They thought the Fathers were doing a mating dance with Mother, and that the children were approaching her for food.
Aleron checked her flight suit, making sure its wings would release properly, transforming her body into something close to what it would have been more than 10,000 years ago. Standing on the edge of the balcony, she let her enhancements feel the winds. She dove, arms tight at her side, and kicked to release the small wings tucked between her three large toes. She used these small wings to guide her descent. She felt the sun on her back, the wind hard on her face as she angled toward the water at over 100 kilometers a second. At 30 meters above the water, she flung her arms wide, releasing her main wings, breaking and angling nearly vertical to the water. The pressure was enormous, but nothing her enhancements couldn’t handle.
She hit the water with arms and feet together, plowing into the back of a school of silvery fish. Her mouth closed around a good sized one even as her legs were just breaking the surface. She arched her back out of the water, extended her feet, and thrust her arms out into the air in a swimming motion. Two more thrusts, and she caught the bottom of the air currents and tacked upwards toward her balcony.
Sitting on her haunches, the sun full up now, she ate the fish methodically. She chewed slowly, savoring the texture and flavor of wild food much as she imagined her ancestors had done millenia before. Maybe she would let Salmerikon relive it with her later. Or did he still catch his own fish once and awhile?
Her body alive, her mind aware, she instructed the room to fetch transportation. She was ready for Raefe now. A few minutes later, the room opened a portal in its back wall and she stepped into a small subway car, half full with neighbors also headed toward work. At the Guardian Center, she found her way to her usual spot on the inner ring of the wormhole interface.
Surprisingly, Raefe’s mind was easy to find today. The fear and stress that she was worried about had triggered changes in him. Intrigued, she probed his memories. At first his strong empathic abilities had overwhelmed him but since she last entangled with him,  his mind had responded by reaching out more strongly to those around him. And she saw that the crisis had intensified his connections with Lina. He was still confused, unstable, a raging storm of desire to do something that will make a difference, and lack of confidence that he can. Part of him cannot bear so much sadness and loss around him, part of him cannot bear not being able to do anything to alleviate it.
She knew that she should discuss this with the Guardian Council in two days, or at least Salmerikon,  but she felt that Raefe’s life hung in the balance. He was the most promising of the two or three thousand humans they monitored.  Losing him would set them back years, maybe a whole generation. Did Earth have that much time? She made a mental note to dig deeper into the available timelines, but she was pretty sure there was little good news there. Time for her to act. She’d had learned an old Earth saying — rules are made to be broken.
It was already night on Earth so she could reach out to him, make first contact in his dreams. With humans, that would be the safest way. 
But right now, he and Lina had snuck out of the camp. Aleron realized they were going off to couple. Humans were usually calmer after sex. Good thing they’re not like the Glynx, who only mated once in a lifetime, after which their whole tribe celebrated for days. She dampened her entanglement with Raefe so as not to risk distracting him. An hour later, she is glad to see that they both have drifted off to sleep in a good state of mind.
She had learned to infiltrated many human’s dreams and Raefe’s were no different. In his memories, she found images of friendly females that sometimes appeared in his dreams. One was a character in the Vids humans watched,  a 2 meter tall woman, longer and leaner than real humans, with very long straight yellow hair, who had a sort of enhancement. Aleron found the hair odd and so modified the image to match her own purple and green shades. Raefe was dreaming he was sitting at his workplace. She walked up to him.
&quot;Mars Girl?&quot; he asked.”Is that you? What have you done to your hair?”
&quot;I'm Aleron. I come from space, just like Mars Girl. You’re Raefe, right?&quot;
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot;
&quot;Let’s just say that you have a special gift that interests me. You are just beginning to come to grips with it, but your world desperately needs people who have this gift.”
“My world? What world are you from?”
 “I live on Anonto, about 20 light years from you. My world was like your world about 10,000 years ago. Now we try to help worlds like yours survive and move forward.&quot;
&quot;I don’t understand. You've traveled here to see me?&quot;
&quot;Traveling with my body would take many lifetimes. But we can send energy — information — through wormholes.&quot;
&quot;So, you're just some kind of holo vid?&quot;
&quot;Not exactly. More like we each live on one end of a giant guitar string. Whichever one of us plucks it, we both feel it. So right now, my brain and your brain are playing a song — having a conversation — over these many light years. We can do that because we are entangled, at a quantum level, with each other.&quot;
&quot;Quantum level? How does that work? Did someone plant a chip in me?&quot;
She sensed his fear. She had unintentionally triggered images of possession — their culture was still so steeped in ancient superstition. She made herself smaller, changed the surroundings to his childhood home. They were sitting on a couch, school children. Her face now reminded him of a childhood friend, Samantha.
“Raefe, you don’t need a chip,” she smiled. &quot;Sometimes you feel like an antenna, right?”
“And I can’t turn it off.”
“That’s because you are extremely empathetic — much more than most humans. You feel other people’s feelings very strongly.”
“Yes!” he said. “It’s too much sometimes. How do I do that?””
“Many ways that you don’t realize. You smell the hormones that leak from all people, you have  finely tuned mirror neurons that very interpret people’s gestures and movements, but most of all, deep inside, unknown to you, you are entangled with the electric waves that are their thoughts and feelings.”
“Are those the voices I hear but not quite make out?”
“Yes, those are the voices in other people’s heads, the little dialog you all carry on with yourself.”
“I’m almost relieved. My head has been so filled with moaning and anguish from all sides, I was beginning to think I had a connection to Hell.”
“Relax, there is no Hell. You are perfectly sane and your abilities are growing. Your mind wants to reach out, to feel others and to let them feel you and other people, too. While it is not something encouraged right now in your world, it is something humans will have to get better at if they are to progress. If your world is to survive, connection and empathy must become more important than competition and aggression. There are others like you, and you all can help lead humans away from self destruction.”
“Lead humans? You’ve got the wrong guy. I can barely get through the day anymore. I’ve disappointed my family, my girlfriend, and myself. If it wasn’’t for me, my brother might still be alive. I can’t help anyone.”
He was in worse shape than she had realized. She was going to have to cross another line.
“Don’t you think you’ve helped Lina?”
“You’re joking,” he said. “If it weren’’t for her, I’d probably have killed myself. I don’t know why she bothers with me.”
“I do. It’s not my job to manage your love life, but I will say this: you live in a world filled with Linas, and they need the same kind of empathy you bring her.”
“Thanks for the pep talk. But what is your job? Why are you here?
“Think of me as a midwife. Imagine you’re giving birth to yourself. The new you will be someone you are very proud to be. But first, you must go through the process of birth. Are you ready for that?”
“Slow down! Give birth, new me — I feel like I just started being me. Not sure I want to get rid of me yet.”
She can feel his mind frantically reviewing vids of alien possession, demons. 
“Sorry, sometimes I forget how strange it must seem if you’ve never entangled with another person. I can give you a sense of it.” She found every point of entanglement she could. ““Can you feel that?”
“Yeah, I do. It’s like I’m seeing you in three dimensions. More like four or five, like I’m seeing the outside of you, but also your feelings and thoughts, all at the same time.”
“That’s it. Now every little touch you feel in your mind, touch back.”
“I can’t really touch you. It’s like I’m a school of fish and you are too, and we’re passing through each other.”
“Now imagine more and more fish in each school until there’s only a small amount of water between your fish and my fish. I’m silver fish and you’’re gold fish. Can you see that?”
“Yes!”
“One more step. Feel how we each disturb the water between us. Move and feel how the water moves. Now I’ll move. Can you feel the vibrations in the water as I move?”
“The vibrations — that’s was how you speak to me?”
“Brilliant! Now you’ve got it. When you feel your headaches, when you feel like the people around you are shouting their thoughts at you in a giant jumble, you’re feeling that water, just all mixed up. If you can focus, you can feel how each little eddy and whorl comes from a mind, how they form a giant chord, and you will learn to separate their melodies.”
“I believe that. Sometimes I sense something like that.”
“It’s no worse than being in noisy place and hearing a lot of voices. It’s just that these voices go deeper into your mind, into what you call your feelings and sometimes, what you think of as your soul. Someday, all humans will be able to do this. But your mind can do this now.”
She had shifted the scene to a subway car. He and Lina were sitting in the seat next to her. Lina was asleep on his shoulder.
“Soon you will awake and you will remember this. Next stop, Somerville. Have a good day!”
She slowly withdrew from his mind, letting his subconscious finish the dream.

            <Text>Bad dreams
September 5, 2048

People are screaming all around him. He can’t see more than a few feet, but he knows something terrible is happening down near the harbor. He hears metal bending, then shredding. He hears water, lots of it, banging cars around, getting louder, drowning out the screams.
Raefe bolted awake, sweating, temples pounding as they always did when he had these visions. He started the deep breathing exercises the therapy app had given him. This must be the remnants of that hurricane, it’s just a storm. In, out, in and — why is the water getting louder? He can feel the screams of drowning people. He shook Lina.
“Get up! We have to get to the roof.”
He yanked her arm, pulling her up out of the bed. She grabbed at her Voice and they ran up the back stairs in their underwear, yelling “Wake up, get to the roof!” to the other residents of their three-container TinyStack, banging ferociously on the third-floor door as they run by. The water sound was loud now, they could barely hear their feet on the stairs.
They got to the roof, Kiko and Kayam right behind them. They bent into the wind, trying to see what was happening. Hurricane Fatima drove sheets of rain toward them. 
“Look!” Lina yelled over the wind. “The storm wall must be shot.” They can barely see that usual bright necklace of lights and gates that is the harbor sea wall, disappeared. Huge waves slammed the shore, cars tumbled like driftwood into buildings. The sea has already pushed the Mystic River fast over its banks, churning inland past the TinyStack.
Kiko pointed wordlessly off to the right. A small ship surfed a 30 foot wave, headed from Boston Harbor toward the Mystic Tobin Bridge. The ship twisted and for a minute it looked like it would pass under the bridge that towered 50 meters above it. Then the water threw the boat back into the farthest pillar. A mile away, they heard the sound of the bridge bending over the roar of the water. The pillar bent, twisting the whole bridge. The bending freed the ship and it continued on until it smashed into a building only blocks away.
The streets were 5 meters deep in sea water all around them and dawn was hours away. They look up at the elevated highway only meters above their TinyStack. They found a track for maintenance robots on the highway stanchion. They wedged their feet between the rails and climbed up. The meet a ragged column of survivors on Interstate 93. The rain is everywhere, there is no escape from its driving needles, but they turn their backs on the flood and march north, away from the harbor.
Raefe could barely look at the survivors, freezing, dressed in underwear, pajamas, blankets or nothing, footsteps silent in the wind and rain. His brain was wracked by a kind of lightning that brought a thunder of drowned screams. He put his hand on the back of Lina’s shoulder. His white hand was like a flashlight on her brown back, and he followed it through the rain. 
They get to the top of a big hill. Lina turns around and shakes him.
“It’s OK, we’re safe,” she says. “We made it.”
He nods and wonders, But when will the screams stop? 
They all turn and look back over East Somerville, now a drowned urban swamp. There are no more streets, just dirty water and short buildings like fat trees sticking out of it.
“So that’s what the apocalypse looks like,” Kayam said, his arms wrapped tight around himself.
“Yeah, where’s Jesus?” Lina answered, annoyed.
“No, no Jesus coming,” Kayam said. “Not like that. No free trip to heaven for the true believers. Look around — you telling me this isn’t the end of our world? You think we’re the only people right now standing on a hill looking at something like this?”
“Kayam, stop it,” Kiko said. “Now’s not the time. Come here.” She embraced him, sobs and tears leaking out of both of them.
“Sorry, K,” Lina said. “Didn’t mean to jump on you like that. You know how I am about all mumbo jumbo.” Kayam waves his hand as if to say, it’s OK, even if nothing is.
“There’s our TinyStack!  Over there.” Raefe said, pointing. He asks what no one has wanted to. “Do you think Miguel got out of the first floor?”
“No way,” Kayam said. “Water was already over back door when we got to the roof.”
“Rest in peace, Migs,” Lina said. “Sorry we didn’t have more time to get to know you.”
“Shit, Kiko,” Raefe suddenly realized, “Where’s your food trike?”
“Serving the fishes,” she said. “You’re going to have to find a new place to get Cubanos and Korean barbecue.”
“Starting to see your point, Kayam,” Lina said. 
Raefe stared at the only home he’s had since leaving his parents. From here, their little TinyStack just looked like bright painted shipping containers stacked under a bridge.
The first light of day brought a dull, gray shine to the city. Traffic was sparse. Lina’s Voice finally found the Net. She sent a text to her parents in Sofricar and gave her Voice to Raefe to call his family. In Raefe’s ear it’s loose, smaller than his, but he jams his finger in to make it work. He talked to it quietly, resetting it to work for him. The Voice took awhile, but it was able to get through to Vermont. 
“Dad, it’s Raefe. Just wanted to let you know I”m OK.”
“Hey, son, so happy to hear your voice. I’m seeing some crazy stuff on the Net — 10 million people homeless, no power to 100 million?”
“I don’t know, Dad. My ‘puters lost in the flood, we had to leave in a hurry. I’m using Lina’s Voice. We just walked all night to get out of the flood. We’re just standing on hill. I’m hoping some cops come by, or any one who knows where we should go.”
“It’s chaos, Raefe. They’re saying the government can’t even find its own people. Digi and Brightstar Defense and some other big corpos say they’re going to help. You know how that works — have a problem and call Brightstar for help, now you’ve got two problems.”
“It just keeps getting, worse, Dad.”
“I’m afraid so, son.”
“How’s Mom? How’s Benny?” He only heard silence. “Can you hear me?”
“Yeah. Raefe, I’m afraid I have some bad news. He was  working a fish ranch out off Stellwagen Bay. The boats that were supposed to get them off never made it. He’s gone, Raefe.”
“Oh, Dad, Benny’s gone?” Raefe couldn’t believe it. “What was he doing out there? I thought he was finishing up engineering school.”
“Well, he wanted to. But when your mom got the ultra-pneumonia, he signed on for a three month contract. Big bucks, he thought we could get her into a hospital.”
“Dad, this is so awful. I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine what you’re going through up there. How’s Mom taking it?”
“Honestly, I haven’t told her yet. At least now, I can tell her you’re alright. But she’s weak from the u-pneu. I’ve been keeping her meds up, getting them cheap from Mexico and Canada. But she needs a hospital.”
Raefe knew his father had a good contract writing code for Muskworks, but insurance wasn’t part of the package. Never was.
 “I want to help, Dad. I’ve been down in TechTown recently and I had a line on a full-time job before all this. Soon as this mess clears, let me see what I can do.”
“Well, we’ll talk when you get settled. I’m happy to hear that. I just don’t want to see you be a contract lifer like your old man.”
Raefe could see him, sitting in their apartment in the endless townhouse flats south of Burlington, staring out at the wind farms on the ridge. On the wall, the photo of Justin Miller and Charlotte Epstein holding newborn Raefe, little Benny looking up, standing in front of a brownstone in Brooklyn. He loved that picture. They’re smiling about their future. No one thought that The Slide was only months away. A secret US weapons test in space would cause a massive communications satellite failure. The Net would disappear for six weeks, tipping the creaky world financial system down the long incline it was still on.  Millions of Justins and Charlottes — billions around the world — would ever have a full time job again. Nor would they ever smile quite as effortlessly.
“My old man is that guy smiling with his girl in the picture on the wall,” he said. “Don’t forget that smile. You give Mom my love.”
“Will do. You take care of yourself. And say hi to Lina.”
Raefe turned to Lina and Kayam and Kiko.
“My dad says the Net is crazy with rumors. One hundred million without power, 10 million homeless. Corpos already feasting on the carcass. My brother was on some fool mission to save my mother — working some fish farm. He’s dead.”
He stood numb, feeling like a giant antenna receiving a million channels, all with bad news. Yesterday he was just another kid struggling to find work and keep it together. Today they were all human driftwood washed up on the new shoreline.

“Stop fidgeting, please,” Lina said. “Since we’ve been back on the train, you haven’t sat still for 5 minutes. You could have walked from Richmond to Philly, as much as you sat down.”
“Sorry,” he said. “I felt sick, I guess from all that adrenaline. But my mind’s going a million clicks an hour.”
“Me too. It’s been quite a day.”
“It didn’t start out that way. We had a nice time in Miami, we did some good building the power station. In my dream, you had this look on your face. Everything’s going to be alright it said. We’re going to make it so. I wish I saw that on you now.”
“You told me I said that you were going to make it alright.”
“You did, it’s true, but it felt like you meant we were going to do it together.”
“I like you Raefe, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”
Raefe stared out at New Jersey going by, the abandoned refineries, the far edges of the New York metropolis just beginning. He hadn’t meant anything romantic by his comment, which didn’t stop Lina’s remark from stinging him.
“I didn’t mean it that way, no offense. The ‘we” was, I don’t know, young people, people on the losing end, really, whoever fits that ‘we.’ And after today, getting ahead of ourselves is exactly what I want to do. How can a moron like that threaten so many ordinary people, just because he’s what, white, American, Christian.  I’m pissed off — I guess after fear comes rage.”
“Authentic, I’ve been there. But here we were, trying to do good. What else are we supposed to do?”
“Whenever we — me, you, whomever, say that, we really mean ‘I can’t do anything about it.’ But I really feel like answering the question — what are we supposed to do?”
“People been asking that for a long time.”
“I know. Did I ever tell you about my Aunt Layla?”
“No, who’s she?”
“My grandmother’s cousin, but we called her Aunt. She’s in her seventies. She’s a pistol, my mom says she always was. She graduated high school, class of 2000, the original millennial. She remembers a lot about that time, and what her people told her about the time before that. It’s not what we were told. They weren’t just the people who used up the planet and streamed each other cat videos while it happened.”
“What were they?”
“She told me that her generation was the first generation of the Slide. Even her older sister expected that each generation would have it better than the one before. They had wars and racism and all that, but it seemed like it was always getting a little better. No one was prepared when it started seriously going the other way, even though they had kind of griped about it before it actually happened. They were all in shock.”
“Every pig eventually finds the trough is empty.”
“I know, that’s the way we look at them. But her parents, and their parents, plenty of them saw how wrong it was. They tried to sound the alarm, they tried to change things. They just didn’t know how. And the corpos already had their fingers in the government and the schools and that didn’t exactly make for intellectual clarity.”
“So nothing’s changed,” she declared, case closed.
“Not my point. I know it was just a dream what you said, but it’s running around in my head all day. Why aren’t we trying? I don’t mean you and me, I mean all of us. Well, most of us. How many people do you know are as evil as the people who ruined your dad’s life, or who totally stopped any attempt to keep the ice caps from melting?“
“Authentic! You know I hate that shit, too – why do I have to hoard carbs ‘cause some corpo bastard spewed soot everywhere for centuries. Everyone contributed, but everyone wasn’t equally to blame, everyone shouldn’t be equally to shame. “
“That’s just some crap they feed us on the ‘net,” he said. ““My aunt say that had already started when she was our age, all these corpos rigging it so we have to pay their freight.”
“Maybe your aunt was just some white chick who found out how the rest of world was living all along.”
 “You know, she said the same thing. That’s what I mean – they were actually wrestling with all of this shit, not just narking out on vids. Anyway, a rising tide floods all coasts, as they say. Everybody acts like we reached Level 17 of some really sooty sim, and we just have to find the magic charm and it will be OK. So far, it’s not OK.What about the future? Are we just going to root around in the marshes for good junk for generations?” 
“Are you serious about this? Or is this just end of vacation blues? I like your vapor, but I really don’t see how anyone can untangle this mess.”
“What about what Alton said — we all have to figure that out?”
“You know the Chinese thought they had it all figured out 100 years ago. Look how that turned out. Shit, America was God’s gift to the world 300 years ago and now it’s mostly in the toilet. Whenever someone’s in my face talking big ideas, I turn around and make sure there’s no one behind stealing my wallet.”
Raefe laughed. Lina was nobody’s fool.
“Ok, ok, I get your point. But lately, I feel like something’s brewing. You’re not the only person who doesn’t listen to all that crap. Practically nobody does, it seems. And they seem fine for it. Look at our neighborhood — everyone in the world lives there. Nobody’s pulling shit like that Davis kid. Everyone likes that you can eat different kinds of food every meal, and hear different music, and you can travel around the world just by talking to people in a coffee shop.”
“I don’t think we’re really having an argument,” Lina said. “I feel that way, too, a lot of times. But the man who did this to me,” she touched her scar, “he looked just like me but he still held a knife to my head and raped me. And marked me so everyone would know. And you know why he did it? Because he got paid by the Chinese, with all their fine talk about making our lives better, like $5 to terrorize our village and that included raping a 10-year old girl. So you’ll forgive my skepticism.”
He didn’t know whether to hug her or hold her hand or say sorry or say nothing.
“Oh, fuck, I’m so sorry. But you know what -- I trust you, Lina. I trust that you would never become that person just for revenge, that you wouldn’t do unto others as they have done to you. You would want to make the world better, not worse.”
“I might want to kill that motherfucker, but not just for revenge, you’re right. And I love that about you, that you always move toward the light. I just don’t always know where the light is, except the other way from the dark.”
 “I need to find that out. After this trip, I can’t just study for tests and hope that I get a not too terrible office serf job and we can afford side by side Tinies. It’s time for me to start poking my head out of the cave and seeing what’s out there.  I can’t quite believe that 200,000 years of evolution and 10,000 years of civilization can only end in a long slide to oblivion.” </Text>

            <Title>Raefe comes to Radisson</Title>
            <Text>Customs had been much easier than he had anticipated. Canada, it seemed, was happy to have people interested in the new territories. Although the US had stopped issuing passports a decade ago, his Cambridge resident papers had been enough and they issued him a visa. Best of all no one had recognized him, an increasingly common and surprisingly welcome occurrence. And now he was finally headed north, through farms and small towns. Soon, even that thinned out and vast stretches of forest covered low mountains.
He thought of his first trip to Africa, the long bus ride from Nairobi to Garissa, then the motorbike ride to Dadaab to reunite with Lina. He had never been outside the United States before that. Nairobi was both exactly like and completely different than cities he had been familiar with. The hustle, the bustle, the millions of people going to and from work — that was every large city. The many miles of broken down slums, the tin roofs, mud streets that encircled the center city, that was only just starting in the US back then.
And then there was the countryside — the many miles of dry, dusty plain already thirsting for rain, already populated by animals looking thin and scared. He realized it was almost exactly 50 years ago that he had made that trip, the one that had changed his life. And here he was again, yet another strange countryside that foretold another kind of future. One where, if everyone was lucky, many millions of people from the hot, dry places and the new submarine coastal towns could peacefully settle this newly thawed band near the Arctic Circle. Because if they couldn’t, the future was even more uncertain and perilous.
And there it was, that feeling again. That the wave was always going to come, just as it had on Truro Island in his old timeline all those years ago. And before that, the terror of the rising waters that night in Somerville, the night that had taken Miguel. He hadn’t thought of Miguel in years. He couldn’t remember what he looked like. He could still see their other neighbors, Kiko and Kayem, and their coffee cart, in his mind. He let his mind wander deep into itself and caught just a snatch of something Miguel had once said, about wanting to save up to go visit his abuela, his aunt, in Nicaragua. No more would come. Sometimes he felt that was all any of them were to the rest of humanity — just a little fragment, deprived of any context or connection. That the connections he had reached out for everyday since he had come to this timeline were nothing more than just a hedge against that.
So be it, then. How was that different than life had ever been? The people who climbed down narrow shafts into caves deep under ground to paint animals by torchlight, hoping for a good hunt? They left a handprint, too, as if to say, the spirits know me now and so will every person who comes this way. It was the picture, not the hand, that we know them by. And so it would be with him and everyone else — if there was a future, it would be their works, not their names and stories, that they were known by, if at all.
If only we could hold that thought! That was the only true reincarnation, wasn’t it? That he could play some part, however small or anonymous, in making sure they had a future. It had come to that — it was more important that there be people in the future than who they admired and remembered in the past. Well, that was really most of human history, when you thought about it.
And here he was, hurtling into the newest part of the world, once again away from his family and friends. He was getting too old for this. The day would come when it would be too late. And he couldn’t let that happen. Soon, he thought, soon I will find a way to get back to Lina.
His thoughts were interrupted by a loud screech as the train suddenly slowed. Horns blared, metal ground and the train came to a lurching halt. He opened his window and looked toward the front of the train. Hundreds of caribou were travelling across the track, headed who knows where. With the window open, he could hear their snorting, their hooves. A gust of wind brought the musky smell of the herd. There were only low trees and scrub up here, and this massive herd.
“They’ll be gone soon,” he heard a voice behind him. He turned to see a middle-aged man, bushy beard and work clothes. “They hate the metal and they’ll rush over the tracks. It makes them nervous.”
“No rush!” Raefe said. “I’m enjoying them. Never seen so many animals at one time.”
“That’s nothing,” the man said. “Before the melts, the herds were ten times that size. Basically, all the caribou in Canada travelled together over the frozen tundra. Now that it’s thawed out — they don’t know where to go. They’re confused about which way to go. They just wander.”
“Oh, that’s terrible,” Raefe said. “I hope they figure it out.”
“Them? They’ll be fine. The truth is, it doesn’t much matter which way they go now. There’s grazing in every direction. Out here, no place for wolves to hide and ambush them. Eventually, they’ll eat the place bare. But not in our lifetimes.”
And just like that, the herd had passed. Away from the iron, they ran with a more measured and coordinated pace. As they receded, it was only the sway of hundreds of antlers that you really saw in the distance. The train blew its horn once more and lurched back to motion.
The herd had gone now, just like that. The train rolled on through the endless flatlands of the old tundra.
“We’ll be there soon enough,” the man said. “See those birds out there?” He pointed to the horizon. “Those are gulls. So we’re approaching the Bay.”
“Thanks,” Raefe said. He started to strike up a conversation but something restrained him. He liked just being here on his own and he suspected the man did too. A few minutes later, he began to have second thoughts, but now he could see a town. The man had been right — they were almost there. Soon they were slowing as they entered the small town, lurching to a halt at a small station. Raefe gave a wave to his train companion and headed off. Noreen’s house was nearby, but he wanted to get a feel for the town first.
Radisson reminded him of what small towns in North America were like when he was a boy. The main street was bustling — you had to pay attention walking down the sidewalk to avoid being jostled. The town looked like everyone had moved in before it was finished. First-floor shops did business while you could hear saws whining and nail guns thumping from the second and third floors. There were many more vehicles (all electric, of course) on the street than in Cambridge and they both drove and parked without any apparent regard for lanes or lines. It seemed like every other pedestrian had a backpack, and a bulging one at that. Radisson was a town on the move and on the make. He wondered if Thunberg would have the same anarchic energy. He let his mind graze the waveform and it was a heady brew of excitement, anxiety, determination, all spiced with a dollop of hope.
He grabbed a burrito from a food stall, filled with stuff he didn’t recognize but liked. The new lands had new cuisine, it seemed. Probably a good thing, he thought. If people are willing to change what they eat, the sky’s the limit, and he laughed to himself at the thought. He found another stall that had coffee — real brewed coffee— and downed a cup, hoping it would clear away the train cobwebs. He wanted to be on his toes with the Thunberg people. It was time to meet them.
He found Noreen’s house and knocked. Somehow he had pictured this strapping middle-aged woman in his mind. She was small and gray-haired. She was the oldest person he had seen since getting off the train, it occurred to him. Not quite his age, but comfortably close.
“Hi, are you Noreen Cheecho?” he asked.
“Yes, what can I do for you?”
“Nila Edwards gave me your name,” he said. “I’m interested in going to Thunberg.”
“She did, did she? And how do you know her?” Noreen asked. He could tell she was suspicious.
“We know each other from the Boston area. Not well. But I was telling her I was interested in Thunberg and she said I should look you up.”
“Ok. And who are you and why are you interested?”
“I do a lot of work in the Boston area and just generally trying to get people together. You know, with all of the changes in the climate and the whole breakdown of civilization thing. I want to understand what new towns like Thunberg are doing and whether we should be doing some of that in the Boston area. Sorry, I should introduce myself. I’m Raefe.”
He felt Noreen’s mind slam on the brakes a bit. He was used to it by now, if also tired of it.
“Welcome. She mentioned you. Raefe Epstein Miller, right?”
“Yup, that’s me. One name will do, though.”
“I was half expecting you’d show up one day, but I thought maybe you’d call ahead, if you know what I mean.”
“Sorry, didn’t mean to surprise you. I’m just me, you know. I don’t need a red carpet or anything. In fact, I hate that stuff. No need to fuss.”
She smiled. “Ok, Raefe it is. Come on in. I’ve got no carpets at all — too muddy up here. I hope that will be fine.”
“Dandy,” he said. She had gone from suspicion to deference to annoyance to amusement in about a minute. Not stuck in one place, this one, he thought, or short on emotional range. If I was going to stay here, we’d probably become friends. She wanted to make him lunch, give him coffee, but took it in stride when he declined. She did, however, indicate that normal procedures would have to be suspended in his case. She could take him to Thunberg tomorrow, but she’d have to let some of the leaders know he was here first. She tapped out a message on her phone. They made small talk while they waited for the others to arrive. He was happy she didn’t want him to do parlor tricks like guess what she was thinking. He still got that sometimes. Probably she knew empaths, it occured to him. He wondered how important empaths were in the scheme of things up here.
A short time later, two women and a man gave a knock and let themselves in. They introduced themselves. Kaitlyn was their health officer here in Radisson, Maggie and Jim were some kind of administrators in Thunberg. Introductions completed, Jim dove right in.
“So what brings you here?”
“Here to learn,” Raefe said. “I want to see what new experimental towns like Thunberg are doing. I see the stuff on the feeds, but I want to get more of a sense of what these communities are like for the people who live in them?”
“Interesting,” Maggie said. “We’re happy to get the exposure, but I’m curious why.”
He could feel that the three women could tangle mildly. They weren’t fully in control and some of their thoughts were leaking out. Concern, mostly, that world-famous REM was here to horn in, mess things up, not really sure. Was he a threat, really, was what they were worried about. Threat to what, he wondered.
“Where to start?” he said. “In the 20 odd years that Everywhere has existed, we’ve brought many people together and tried to create new ways of living. In one sense, we’ve done well — human beings haven’t killed off the human race, and we haven’t succumbed to the worst of all the many disruptions. In other respects, we’ve accomplished very little. Many days it feels like we’re just kidding ourselves, that we’re just delaying the inevitable. The old is gone, but what is going to be the new way?”
“And you think towns like Thunberg might be the new way?” Maggie asked.
“I don’t know. That’s why I came to look. There are many millions of people in Everywhere and billions of people watch what it does, and other groups like it. Maybe we’re too big and messy now. I want to see what other people are doing, what new ideas are out there. I wanted to see if towns like Thunberg offer any lessons about how we can build on what we’ve done, make it more stable, more of a platform for the future. More sustainable, but not in the old sense of the world. I mean, can people sustain your way of life in large numbers. To put it bluntly, should Boston be the next Thunberg?”
“So you’re not thinking should Thunberg be the next Boston?” Jim said.
“Huh,” Raefe said. “I guess not. I’m not even sure I know what you mean by it.”
“That millions of people from the coasts should come up here and join in,” Jim said.
“No, I wasn’t thinking of that,” Raefe said. “I wasn’t really thinking that far ahead. Please, I think you think I have some grand agenda here. I’m just an old man who’s frustrated with how things are at the moment and searching for new ideas in new places.”
He saw that Kaitlyn was watching him intently. The others turned to her and she gave a quick, small nod.
“We can take you there tomorrow,” Kaitlyn said. “I don’t know if we have the answers you are looking for, but you deserve a chance to figure that out. Not everyone who shows up here falls into that category.”
He wondered what that meant and what they were concerned about. He wanted to tangle with Kaitlyn but thought better of it. They might take it the wrong way, like he was trying to read their secrets, or influence them covertly. Even after all of these years, he was wary of how people would react to his abilities. He had always feared that someday there would be a reaction to empaths, and that it might turn ugly. That it had never happened was actually a mystery to him, but he never lost the feeling of being careful with his abilities.
“I appreciate that,” he said. “There are so many people around the world trying to keep their heads above water, literally and figuratively. None of us can be expected to find a total solution on our own — all we can do is what seems to each of us to be the way forward. But it’s so important that what I learn, or what you learn, or a the people building floating cities off the coast of Vietnam, or whomever, all learn from each other. So that’s what I hope can happen during my visit.”
“How long do are you intending to stay?” Maggie asked.
“Honestly, I don’t know,” Raefe said. “If you’ll have me, at least a few days or weeks so that I can get the feel of things, see how things really work here. I plan to visit other communities, too. Whatever time you can give me, I will make what use of it I can. In the end, I want to be able to talk with others around the world about the newest and most promising projects. Not because I hope everyone will move to this or that experimental community, but because everyone can adopt their ideas and bend them to their circumstance.”
As he said it, he realized that was what they wanted to know: Are you going to leave? Or are you going to have your followers come and take over? Even here, at the end of the Earth, at the end of the world, people still wanted to cling to their power and office, however small it was.
“Yeah, we’re cool with that,” Jim said. “Why don’t you rest up, see the local sights, and tomorrow Noreen will take you upriver to Thunberg.”
And with that, he and Maggie and Kaitlyn left.
“Well, I think you at least eased their fears,” Noreen said. “And I’m glad.”
“I guess I am, too,” he said. “What were they afraid of?”
“Oh, I’m sure you could tell better than me,” she said. “Someone with your abilities. But I know that they get protective of Thunberg. And not for no reason — you can’t imagine the number of ambitious scam artists we get. Maybe it seems kind of tawdry to you, but I hope you keep that in mind.”
“Sure,” he said. “Trust me, Everywhere has been visited by every sales person of every kind of economic, political and cultural snake oil you could imagine. And it takes its toll — you can become very dismissive of other peoples’ ideas, other sorts of passions. And in the end, that’s the real tragedy these power-seeking con artists bring about. Because we have a generation to set in motion a millenium of repair and restoration and it would be great to be able to focus just on that. But then again, if we lived in that kind of world, we wouldn’t be here at what used to be the end of the Earth having this conversation.”
“Agreed,” she said. “I’m starting to think maybe it’s good you’re here—we can’t pretend we’re the only ones with good new ideas. Anyway, you can have the room in the back. You’re welcome to eat here with me. Or I can take you out for dinner on the town — they make a good fish stew at Barnies, there’s good local brews everywhere. Or if you want some time on your own — go for it. But we’ll be leaving at dawn.”

            <Text>Keep on trucking
“We’re going to Liverpool,” Gordo announced. “A boat will take us south of the border to Wales. There’s a large forest area, Snowdonia, used to be a park for campers and the like. There’s some people will take us through there, and then well, it’s complicated, but there are people who will get us to Devon.”
“You trust them not to turn us over to the corpos?”
“Don’t know much about Wales, do you?”
“Nothing,” Raefe laughed.”
“These lads, their great-grandads were thrown out of work by the first of the corpos, back in Iron Maggie’s day at the end of the industrial era. Four generations is nothing at all for them to hold a grudge in those parts — it’s baked into the culture for centuries, just like here. And of course the corpos in the City take every opportunity to stick it to them, so no, the fire’s never gone out. You’re safe with this lot — they’d never do anything to help the City. You’re their hero.”
“Does Lina know the plan?”
“Yes, we’ve been  in touch. She has some ideas she wants to discuss with you, so whenever you get the chance…”
“Right. When we’re on the road.”
“Perfect. Grab some kit — we need to get out of here while we can.”
Raefe had nothing but some clothes and his puter to toss in a pack, along with winter gear and some food. He put the coat and the pack on and grabbed some boxes of food. There were about twenty people packing three good-sized box trucks with Northern Electric written on the side. Gordo laughed at Raefe’s puzzled expression.
“We’ve got a rental agreement,” Gordo said. “Very low rate. Gives us a ready reason to be on the road. You’ll be in that truck, with Claire. She actually does worth for Northern and knows the drill, so she’ll do all the talking if it comes to that.”
Raefe walked over to the truck Gordo had indicated.
“Where do you want the food,” he asked Claire, a short, very dark skinned woman who looked to be about 35.
It sounded like she answered “All the way up front,” her thick Scots accent turning the words into taffy.
“And me?”
“You stay in the back until we get near Leeds. Can’t have McDornish’s men spotting you around here. We’ll switch off after that.”
There were six of them in the back, sandwiched between the food up front and boxes of spare parts for wind turbines in the back. They’d pass no more than a cursory inspection if it came to that. Someone outside pulled the truck door down and the inside went dark. Claire started the motors, and they were off, bouncing down the rough streets. He heard a voice talking quietly on a mobile and the interior lights went on.
Gordo was up front with Claire, for now. He recognized Ea, a dark-haired, quiet girl who looked vaguely Persian and was good with electronics. Her girfriend, Trina, sat next to her, nervously twirling her blond curls. Brian was almost Raefe’s age, his Irish face lined with years of hard work on the docks. Sitting closest to the back door were Mikey and Ganesh, brothers in their late ‘20s. Gordo had recruited them from one of the Hindu skinhead gangs after the ‘74 battles — they had turned sour on a life of hunting Muslims otherwise just like them. They both had old British Army submachine guns with large magazines.
“For McDornish’s gang,” Ganesh said, as if reading Raefe’s thoughts.
“Do we have intel on them?” Raefe asked. “I hadn’t really thought about old Benjamin the true Briton. What’s he doing?”
“I hacked their shit,” Ea said. “He don’t know what to do. If he goes south, he’s nobody. Worse, if anyone recognizes him. If he stays, he’s frozen dinner for the next 1,000 years. But it’s his freezer, way he sees it. His lads are in an uproar.”
“We hear some of them are taking old Benjie’s Viking heritage spew seriously,” Mikey said. “Rape, pillage and leave. Not this truck.”
“Used to getting their way with people, that lot,” Ganesh said. “It’s what they know. Fighting the climate just confuses them. But we’ll straighten them out.” He patted the stock of his gun.
“We can be quiet about it, too,” Trina said, hiking up her jeans to reveal a large knife in her boot.
“Not that I’m not very glad you’re here,” Raefe said, “but before you starting shooting and slashing, I can tell you if you need to. I’ll know how hard they’re going to play it. If they’re just out for a little intimidation, let me talk it through with them first. Always better not to leave bodies behind.”
“If you say so, guvnor,” Mikey said, unconvinced. “If you say so.”

            <Title>Mik talks to his dad</Title>
            <Text>Mik had told his parents the news and they had taken it well enough. But he knew they weren’t finished with him. He had been dreading another Talk About His Future, and making himself appropriately scarce. But they knew he would have to make his final decision this week, and he knew they would find a way to lobby him for their plan for his life. And now that moment had come.
Under the guise of shopping for a suit to wear to graduation, Larry had maneuvered him into a trip to New Kendall’s one mall. Or “nice for the men in the family to have a day out,” as Larry put it. Nice for whom, Mik wondered. He doubted his dad really enjoyed this, either.
But here they were, taking the 20 minute walk to the store. Larry burbled on about his fantasy football team leading the league in goals, how clothing sales were up in so many parts of the world, things were getting better, the new century was going to be exciting, and then he just seemed to run out of inane things to say and they walked quietly.
“So, listen, before we get to the store, I just wanted to make sure you’re set with your choice this week. I know it can be hard to sort it out. If you want to brainstorm, happy to do that.”
“Thanks, dad. I think I’m pretty set on AI interfacer. Like I told you before, it’s something that interests me and I think I could be good at it.”
“I’d like to think my son could be good at almost anything,” Larry said. “And that if the corporation also thinks you’d be good at marketing or logistics, that it’s worth considering why.”
“They don’t tell you that,” Mik said. “It might have nothing to do with me. Maybe they just need more of those people. They didn’t even give Junior a choice. They’re sending him to learn some Indonesian language just because he looks vaguely like people over there and they’re desperate to crack that part of the world.”
“I think you’re being a bit cynical there,” Larry said. “I’m sure there’s more to it than that.”
Mik let it sit. “Anyway, I did think about marketing and logistics. The truth is, I don’t care at all about stuff like marketing. What does it matter who buys what from whom? Really? It’s not like anybody cares if everyone actually has food and clothing — they just want to make sure the people who buy it buy it from New Kendall.”
“Guilty as charged,” Larry said. “And why not? If they buy it from us, we know it’s well made, it won’t kill you, and the money won’t go to some warlord somewhere who will use it to buy guns and cause more trouble.”
Ah, the “we’re the good guys” speech, Mik thought.
“I get that there are bad people in the world, dad. I’m not four years old. But are we always the good guys?”
“We’re not perfect, Mik. I know you have your criticisms and that’s normal. How will things change if you don’t get involved?”
“I wish I believed that things would change if people listened to us kids. But I can’t find any examples. We’re the ones who change. We get on the treadmill and the corporation tells us when to run and how fast.”
“Whoa, son. Who have you been talking to?”
“No one, dad. And everyone. Lots of people think that.”
“Not in my experience. But if you feel that way, how is being an AI interfacer any different? I just worry that you are backing yourself into a dead end because you’ve somehow formed a very negative opinion of things around here. And you’ll just get more frustrated when it turns out to be a dead end. Whereas, if you got involved with more dynamic areas like marketing, you’d get a chance to experience what New Kendall is all about. Be part of something bigger.”
Mik weighed his words. One part of him wanted to tell him about the night on the bridge. Another part knew that could spiral out of control and go places he didn’t want to know about, much less go to.
“Aren’t we all part of something bigger anyway? Isn’t everyone just trying to learn how to live in this messed up world that constantly surprises us with unexpected storms, glaciers dropping the ocean, fires, droughts? I already feel that. I just want to do something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m somehow making it worse.”
“I was hoping that you’d see it differently,” Larry said. “This is going to be a very important year for us, for the world. There’s a new century around the corner, and we’re trying to turn that corner. All of us. And I was hoping that you would be on the team with me, working hard to, as you say, make things better. I just think it’s going to be exciting and challenging and it would be great for us to experience it together.”
“Honestly, Dad, this has nothing to do with you and me. I’m not doing this to make you feel bad, or look bad. I can’t really explain it. It just feels more comfortable to me,” Mik said, having made up his mind that he was not going to open the curtain on his desire to contribute as little as possible to New Kendall’s drive for world domination.
“So your mind’s made up?” Larry asked.
“Mostly,” Mik said, not wanting to say the part about it was that or follow Nila out of town.
“Ok,” Larry said. “I just wanted to make sure you’d thought it through. Well, we’re here. Let’s go get you a suit!”
* * * * *
Tomorrow he would submit his choice, AI interfacer, and it would be done. He didn’t even really know if it mattered. The ocean didn’t care what your job was when it came roaring up the Charles. The old maple grove near Nila’s theater didn’t suddenly start giving maple syrup again just because you came to your senses and chose Marketing. He’d do his job, go home and do whatever. With whomever. It was all to play, and that was more exciting to him than what team he was on.
“But I couldn’t tell Larry that,” Mik said, trying to explain his awkward shopping trip to Nila.
“I never tell Val or Mitch anything,” Nila said. “They’d just use it against me.”
“What puzzles me,” Mik said, “is how they act so blind. If I have to hear one more time about ‘the new century,’ I’m going to throw up.”
Nila laughed. “People used to believe that saints and spirits and all sorts of invisible things were going to save them. Now it’s a calendar. Doesn’t that just say it all?”
“Right, like the world’s big problem is that no one knows what day or date it is.”
“You should have heard Kenny Junior’s speech. He actually told them that his father was right, that all the people who tried to stop him were just doomsday naysayers, whatever that means. Like it isn’t doomsday.”
“Do you think he really believes all of that or does he just pour it on for the troops?” Mik wondered.
“I couldn’t hear any notes of doubt, let’s just say that,” Nila said. “And anyway, as long as he’s going to say it and back it up, does it matter?”
“Huh. Maybe not,” Mik said. “What about your folks? Are they pressuring you to join Security?”
“No, because I told them I am joining Sec,” she said.
“No way!”
“Oh, I’m not really. But if I told them that, there’d be a drone following me around everywhere. Like instantly.”
“So what are you going to do?”
“I think you know,” she said.
Mik had been dreading this moment. “Yeah, I guess I do. And I’m not surprised. But sad.”
“You can do the same,” she said, her voice softer now. “It would be nice.”
“It would be,” he said. “But I’m just not ready to do that yet. I’m not as brave as you.”
“I don’t feel brave. Furious, desperate, yeah, brave, no. Brave would be getting up at school and asking who wants to come with me.”
“I think it’s brave that you even think these things. I admire what you’re doing. I just can’t bring myself to face so many unknowns, all at once. Especially after watching those fugees trying to cross the river. It wasn’t just that we shot at them. It was how much they had to risk, just to stay alive. That’s one thing we never learn at New K — how to stand on your own.”
“They’re not on their own. They have each other, and Everywhere. We’re more on our own here in New K.”
He thought about that. Maybe she was right. But he was actually scared of what would happen outside New K. He really had no idea of how he would make a life for himself outside of the corpo world.
“But I know you don’t see it that way,” Nila said. “I’ll miss you.”
“And I’ll miss you. I’ve never known anyone like you. Or felt like I do about you. How long do we have?”
She shrugged. “Who knows? But not long. I haven’t figured it all out, but when I do, it’s best you don’t know.”
He leaned over and kissed her. Their kiss trailed off. She kissed him on the forehead and stood up, turned around and walked away. He wanted her to stay, he wanted to talk more about this, but he knew nothing would change. He thought of their first kiss and smiled.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Hanakori and Anatope conspire</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter &lt;$n&gt;
Anatope and Hanakori discuss their progress and strategy. Hanakori begins by telling Anatope how important it is to manage their follow conspirators.  
Anatope, you and I understand our true nature and that of species in general. As we draw closer to success, we will need to be ever more vigilant to manage our brothers. The quest that has taken us this close to success on E12 and our vision to establish a higher order among all species will be challenged by our own limitations. This is what has held back the Ranoldi evolution and that of others—this fear of achieving true control of our universe. Through e12 we will finally rid ourselves of doubts that we have artfully disguised as some type of altruistic vision among all species. 
“So what are you suggesting Hanakori? I share your concern but feel that we must count on our fellow conspirators if we are to succeed. Look at the technical progress that Putnomo has made.”  
And that’s exactly the paradox Anatope. The closer we get to our ultimate vision—to this higher order and new relationships, the more even our high capacity brothers might start to waiver. Petty jealousies like I have detected recently can lead to our undoing.
By the way, I just received an urgent encrypted message from Levilon saying that he wants to share something. This is what worries me. We need our fellow brothers but can we really count on them to make the right decisions and to stay strong? Yes we recruited them because they stood our as un-poisoned by the ridiculous Ranoldi credo. And yes, each brings a clear capacity. BUT……I still worry.
Anyway, I will follow up with Levilon. I assume that his little committee has come up with something. I’ll let you know.
In the meantime I want you to spend even more time with Putnomo. Is it really possible that we are within let’s say 20 Ronaldi years of success? Think about it Anatope. No more fear of an uncertain future. Our ability to provide order and meaning to the universe; to save other species from having to navigate the great unknown. You and I——and others of course once things settle—will be able to make decisions for the common good. For the good of the universe!  It’s truly a remarkable point in time.

            <Text>Game on
February 23, 2049
Something tugged at Raefe’s consciousness, pulling him back from the intricacies of wiring up Titan Towers, the new sim game his team was working on. Without turning around, he knew that Mike, his boss, was walking across the floor to see him. What he couldn’t tell was why, but at least he didn’t feel anything overtly hostile.
“Hey, Raefe, got a minute?” Mike asked. Raefe turned around, acting vaguely surprised.
“Sure, Mike, what’s up?”
“How far along are you on the Titan sim?”
“Pretty far along. I’ve plugged in all the physics algorithms — local gravity, Jovian gravity, solar radiation, that kind of thing. Herbie is working on the projectile stuff —— asteroids, comets and so on. All I have left is to install the low-G effects and then the behavioral algorithms. How will people react to solar storms, alien attacks? You know, the usual.”
“That’s good, sounds like we’re in the home stretch. You do a lot of these sims. Do you like the work?”
Uh oh, Raefe thought, danger ahead. He still couldn’t feel any serious negativity from Mike.
“It’s fine. If you do a lot of these, you start to see that they’re all pretty similar. On the one hand, you’ve got an environment with built in limitations and threats. On the other hand, you have humans who have a range of probably responses to each other and the environment. And you want to make this opaque but not invisible to the players. They want to discover what makes the sim world work, and master it. But the outcome is always known — life or death, rich or poor, win or lose.””
“No flies on you. That’s a pretty good summation — a lot of guys take many years to see that.”
Raefe blushed. Had he said too much?
“Anyway, I suspected you had a pretty good handle on it, because I usually see your name near the top of the efficiency reports I get. Now I know it’s probably because you’re quite clear about what to do and not that you’re using mind enhancing drugs.”
No, not repeating my old man’s mistakes, Raefe thought.
“Thanks, I guess.”
“Sure. But what I wanted to ask you about is whether you’d want to work on a different kind of sim. Same technology, but different reasons and very different algorithms. And it’s not a game, at least not a pay-to-play one.”
“Huh, sounds interesting. So what is it?”
“Well, it’s part of something called the Civilization Project over at MIT. Have you heard of the Cosmos sim?”
“Where they replay the history of the universe and tweak stuff to see how it all turns out? Sure. Aren’t a lot of our physics codes dumbed down from that?”
“Yeah, because our customers don’t have quantum computers to run the full code. Anyway, in a similar vein, they want to simulate the evolution of society.”
“That doesn’t sound new. Weren’t some of the very first sim games about building a city, or farming?”
“This is not that. They’re starting with monkeys and ending with our world.”
“OK, that’s cool. Yeah, sure, I’d be interested.”
“MiniWorlds is partnering with them on this. In the end, we’ll get a lot of fresh behavioral code that could give us much richer sims. And guys like you will learn new algorithms and new coding techniques. I can’t really explain more than that. What I’d like you to do is go to a briefing at MIT next week. I’ll let your team leader know you won’t be here. Then let’’s talk.”

            <Title>In this chapter,</Title>
            <Text>In this chapter, something triggers a conflict in Nigeria and Raefe and/or Lina go with Alton. They witness firsthand how violence emerges from small conflicts unbidden. They see how entanglement can make that less likely by revealing people’s true motivations.

Lina and Edna can sense that a group of raiders has Edna’s daughter and are about to rape her. Edna remembers her own gang rape from the past. She makes the men feel what she felt then. They’re taken aback and don’t know who or what is making them feel this. Their leader wants them to proceed. Raefe senses that he is a sociopath, that he cares nothing for his own men, or their stated cause. He thinks they are weak and inferior and need him. He lets Alton feel this and together, they let the raiders feel this. They desert their leader.
Later, Alton tells Goodstuff about it. They talk excitedly about this as a new direction for their “army.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Conflict arises for the first time. Mik has doubts. He and Nila talk through how they decided to come here. Still valid. She tells him her dad.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Mik was somewhere between excited, exhausted and relieved after his first week in Thunberg. Excited, of course, to finally be here, in a place that was definitely not New Kendall. Exhausted from work — kids in New Kendall were told that the school’s rigorous physical training would make them fit for the new world they were inheriting, but that was nothing like being fit for a new world you were creating. And mostly, relieved that he and Nila hadn’t made the worst decision of their lives. Things would be hard, but promising. And they wouldn’t have to kill people or otherwise act like total dicks. That was good enough for now. Who could see further than now, anyway?
He and Nila were still bunked in the New dormitory, awaiting their assignments. There had been an awkward moment when Ralph, their unit leader, had asked if they were a couple and wanted to bunk together. He realized that he had sort of hoped that might happen, but Nila just smiled at Ralph and said, no, just friends. She went off to the end of the building for women, he for men. At least they hadn’t put him with the children. Childhood seemed to end at 16 here, so he was thrown in with a dozen or so guys of various ages.
Life seemed to start early in Thunberg, but that was mostly because the days were still pretty short this far north and even if he got up at 7, it was still mostly dark. So he shuffled down the dark corridor to the dining hall, looking for Nila. They had been eating meals together, although it was starting to dawn on him that in time maybe they would each settle into new friendships. Nila, at least, was acting like that. Today, though, she was sitting by herself at the table near the corner and he grabbed some food and coffee and went over to sit with her.
“Hey, don’t I know you from somewhere?” he said.
“Can’t be. I’m from nowhere,” she said. They had fallen into this silly joke on the second day and so far it was sticking.
“What’s up?” he returned, having nothing really to say.
“Not much,” she said, deciding not to mention that she had heard from Raefe. She might tell him later, out of earshot of so many people. She wasn’t sure what the reaction would be if others found out. “Ralph was here a few minutes ago. We’re going out to do maintenance on wind turbines.”
“Cool,” he said. “Although I have no idea what that involves.”
“Hard work, according to Ralph,” Nila said.
“Same as everything else, then?” he replied.
She laughed. “You noticed?”
“Yeah, everyone’s big on that here. But, hey, we are soft compared to them, you have to admit.”
“Totally. But we’ll toughen up. No magic to it.”
“I guess. No harm in it either.”
An hour later, the sun just lighting up the landscape, they were in a group of 20 people walking up a trail to a ridgeline where a dozen turbines stood. These had no blades — just six-story high cylinders with vertical corkscrews inside that turned in the wind. A screened covering kept birds and small animals from getting chewed up inside. Still, some got stuck and they would have to remove them, along with leaves and sticks and whatever else got plastered to the screens. There were rungs welded onto the outside of the cylinders. Ralph divided up some of the crew into two-person teams — one to climb and remove debris, the other to stay just below them and collect the debris in large sacks that could be lowered to the ground, where they would be emptied.
Mik was paired with Yohan, who seemed in his early twenties. Yohan had only been in Thunberg a few weeks more than Mik and Nila. Mik asked him what he wanted him to do.
“I don’t know, man,” Yohan said. “I’ve never done this before. We were mostly tilling land before this. I guess we’ll figure it out.”
So Yohan started climbing. Mik waited until he was four rungs up and followed, the long sack trailing behind. They worked slowly up, cleaning the screens. It was mostly leaves, which was fine with Mik — he was hoping they wouldn’t have to deal with half-dead birds stuck in the screens. Soon he was lost in the rhythm of taking the hand-offs from Yohan and before he knew it, his sack was full.
“Yohan, relax,” he called up. “I have to empty my bag.” He clipped a carabiner to the bag and a pulley to a rung and starting lowering the rope.
“Wo, man,” Yohan said. “We’re pretty high up.”
Mik looked out. He hadn’t even noticed, but they were. They had climbed maybe four or five stories already, plus they were on this high ridge. It felt like they were 20 stories up.
“Yeah, how about that,” he said. “It’s more rolling than I realized.”
Yohan didn’t say anything. Mik looked up to see Yohan standing stiffly on a run, clasping it tightly.
“You OK?” he asked. 
“Not really,” Yohan said. “I’ve never been up this high. I didn’t think I was afraid of heights, but I’m having trouble with this.”
“Well, let’s go down,” Mik said. “We can find something else to do, I’m sure. Can you make it?”
“I don’t know,” Yohan said. “I’ll try.”
He started to lower his right foot down to the next rung but couldn’t bring himself to let his arms stretch to reach it. He was frozen. Mik wasn’t sure what to do. Ralph was down on the ground, already about 100 yards away. If he yelled, Ralph would hear. Maybe Ralph would be pissed off that they couldn’t figure it out by themselves. Mik decided he would try to help Yohan.
“Don’t move, I’m coming up to help,” he shouted up. He climbed up two rungs and he was just below Yohan, who was now a danger to them both.
“Ok, Yohan, here’s what we’re going to do,” he said, trying to sound confident. “I’ve got this rope that you can clip to the rung. I’m going to clip it one rung below you and then pass the rope up. I’m making a big loop in it — put that over your head, bring it down below your arms, and then up into your arm pits. That way, if you slip, the rope will catch you after a rung or two.”
He reached up and handed the rope to Yohan, who was now clearly losing it. But he managed to get the rope around him and took a halting step down, and then another. He couldn’t manage undoing the carabiner, though. But the rungs were wide, and Mik climb past him to reach the carabiner, undo it, and go down two rungs to reclip it. They repeated this over and over, and slowly they made their way down. Mik could see that others had noticed — there were anxious glances their way, and Ralph was at the bottom now, craning up to see what was going on. But Mik didn’t tarry long looking down — he was worried about Yohan, who was still shaking and sweating above him.
Finally, they made it to the bottom. Mik unhooked Yohan, and they slumped on the ground, exhausted. 
“You guys done already?” Ralph asked.
“No, we had to come down,” Mik said.
“Why?”
“It’s my fault,” Yohan said. “I guess I kind of freaked out up there. I looked out and we were so high up. I got nervous.”
“Well, alright, I guess that happens sometimes,” Ralph said. “Take a deep breath and when you’re over it, give it another go.”
“I don’t think that would be a good idea,” Mik said. “He wasn’t kidding — he was really having a hard time up there.”
“A lot of things we do here are hard,” Ralph said. “Repairing the world is hard. We all have to learn how to stretch ourselves.”
“If you stretch him, he’ll just snap,” said a voice from the small crowd that had gathered. Mik recognized Nila’s voice.
“Let’s give the guy a chance,” Ralph said. “If you’re going to make it here, you have to push yourselves sometimes.”
“I’ll take his place,” Nila said. “He can take my job here on the ground.”
“Thanks!” Yohan said, gathering up his rope to give her before anyone could argue. 
Ralph looked annoyed and skeptical. “Alright, but somewhere along the line you’re going to see that’s not the way.”
Mik was just glad that he wasn’t going to have to be under Yohan up there again. Ralph might be pissed off, but if Yohan fell on to Mik it was the end for both of them. Nila started up the rungs and he followed behind. Neither talked much — they just wanted to finish up and get down. Later that night, though, they went for a walk after dinner and found a secluded spot.
“What the fuck happened up there?” Nila wanted to know.
“You saw how high we were,” Mik said. “I guess Yohan was never up that high and discovered he doesn’t like heights. He was really freaking up there. I was scared he was going to let go and hit me on the way down.”
“Yeah, I could feel his fear when I came over. And shame,” she said. “That was good thinking, by the way, what you did. I don’t think I would have thought of that. Would have been nice if Ralph had recognized that you just saved at least one life. What an idiot!”
“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe you have to be that way up here.”
“Why?”
“I don’t know,” he said. “I don’t know anything about what it’s going to be like living here yet. I’m just trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.”
“Very kind of you, considering he could have got you killed.”
“True, but still,” he said. “But I definitely owe you for taking Yohan’s spot. Thanks.”
“You’re welcome,” she said. “I just hope that sort of thing isn’t common around here.”
They walked back to the dorm and went their separate ways. But Nila was furious, still stewing inside. She had only caught a glimpse of Ralph’s emotions during the whole incident, but she wasn’t happy about what she felt. Ralph was clearly more interested in how quickly they could get the whole job done, and annoyed at Yohan for slowing them down. He didn’t seem to care at all that Yohan was terrified and humiliated by the experience, all needlessly. That all seemed too New Kendally for comfort. Not that Thunberg wasn’t amazing — but now she was realizing that maybe all of its residents weren’t amazing.
She debated finding Ralph and hashing it out. Maybe Mik was right — give him the benefit and all. Before she could make up her mind, she saw Ailyn in the doorway. Ailyn was one step up Thunberg’s heirarchy from Ralph. His boss, Nila thought, although they didn’t really like that word here, or what it implied. Ailyn waved her over.
“Hey,” she said. “Heard you had some adventures today. I thought maybe we could go for a walk and talk about it.” Nila didn’t get the sense that “No, thanks, I’m beat” was going to be a good answer. She grabbed her coat and tagged along. Ailyn played tour guide as they walked through neighborhood, until they reached the edge of the settlement. She pointed to a path off into the brush and they headed off.
“So I heard from Ralph that you two had kind of a thing out there today,” Ailyn said.
“A thing?” Nila said, trying to keep an edge out of her voice. “What kind of a thing?”
“A disagreement,” Ailyn said. “Out in the field, where we try not to have those kind of things.”
“Did he tell you about Yohan?” Nila asked. “Because that’s what our ‘thing’ was about. He could have died out there. Are you trying not to have that kind of thing out in the field, too?”
“Hey, ease up,” Ailyn said. “I know you think you were right, and good for you. But you’re new here, and maybe you want to dial it back a bit until you get a feel for things.”
“Look, I don’t know what Ralph told you. Yohan and Mik came down from the tower and Yohan was pale and sweaty and shaking and he looked like he was going to puke. Ralph was giving him the suck it up speech, but Yohan was just blank. And Mik clearly didn’t want to go back up with him and have the guy fall on him and kill them both. So I volunteered to do Yohan’s job. I’d think you would be thanking me for stepping up.”
“Well, yes, that was…I don’t know, brave of you. So thanks. But we don’t run on personal bravery here. We run on being a community that pulls together, where everyone pulls their weight, faces their fears, and does their best for everyone else.”
“Cool. But what are you saying, that Yohan wasn’t doing his best for everyone else? That he’s some kind of slacker who needs to grow up, or toughen up, or some kind of up? Cause all I could feel was fear of heights there. You don’t kick that from a pep talk.”
“When you say all you could feel, you mean you tangled with him?” Ailyn asked.
“No, not really,” she said. “That takes two, and I don’t think he can. But I don’t need to tangle to sense those kind of emotions — he was broadcasting fear. I don’t even think you had to be an empath to see that. And Mik was right with him the whole time, and he was saying, whoa, this guy’s not going to make that. Ralph should have just listened.”
“This isn’t about him or you or Yohan. It’s about the whole community.”
“And what is the community without him or me or Yohan or you or any of us?” she asked, starting to lose patience with Ailyn.
“The community is about doing what needs to be done. We’re not living in a world where we have safe choices. Only the best of bad ones. The sooner you learn that, the more you’ll be able to contribute.”
I could almost imagine my mom saying all that, Nila thought. How disappointing!
“I believe in what you, what we, are trying to do here,” Nila said. “But I grew up in an enclave, which isn’t so different than this. It had a different, completely opposite goal. But I’m thinking, hey, what you just said isn’t that different than what the bosses at New Kendall would say to us kids when they wanted us to knuckle under. Or even what they would say to our parents. I thought things would be different here.”
Nila could feel immediately that she had just said the wrong thing. Now Ailyn was thinking that she was just a rebellious but spoiled teenager.
“And you don’t?” Ailyn said.
“No, I realize that came out wrong,” Nila said, trying to find some common ground. “Look, I even get the idea that maybe along the way, saving the world and all that, some people might get hurt, some might even get killed. I took a risk going up there, didn’t I? But can’t we save that for the really big and worthwhile things? I’ve never noticed that the people who behave like robots are the ones who are really making a difference.”
Ailyn stopped walking. Nila knew she was trying to decide what to say, but wasn’t even sure what she thought — Nila had not dazzled her with her logic.
“Here’s what I think,” Ailyn said. “You’re a smart person, you want to deeply commit to things, but maybe you’ve also been sheltered from hard choices. So I’m not going to beat you up for that. I would ask that you respect our ways here for the moment. If you disagree, fine, voice it. But no more taking matters into your own hands. Yohan could have refused all on his own, and that would have been different. We find many people take weeks, even months, to get the vibe here. Some never do. So let’s see how that goes, OK?”
“I guess,” Nila said. At least she’s not kicking me out, she thought. Mik’d be furious if I dragged him all the way up here and got booted practically immediately. She had to admit that maybe she had been sheltered from hard choices. She’d thought coming here was a pretty hard choice. But maybe when you make one hard choice, there are more to follow. “Yeah, let’s see how it goes.”

            <Text>Family planning
May 26, 2049
Aleron gazed out over endless sea, the wind whipping her feathered crest.
“Once our ancestors could cross that ocean with no tech at all,” Salmerikon said. “Now, we wouldn’t get far at all with these engineered flight suits.”
“Funny how the ocean is now harder for us to cross than space itself,” Aleron said. “Now that we all live on this continent, we have little reason to go to the other continents. And there’s machines to take us there when we do. Still, it’s been years since I soared over open water. Do you want to glide for awhile?”
“I have a better idea. Well, at least a different one. Can you swim?”
“Can you?”
“Yes, centuries ago I visited Fourth World for some Guardian business. You have a student from there — Adno.”
“Right. The water world.”
“They have small floating platforms for visitors, but after awhile I felt stupid asking them to come to the edge of the platform every time we wanted to meet. Our flight suits have a fail-safe mode for water, did you know that?”
“No, I didn’t.”
“Well, if you go too deep they warn you. If they detect that you’re hurt or unconscious, they slowly move you to the surface. This is in case you fall into the water flying through the canyons. But it will work in the ocean, too. So I decided I would see how our ancestors might have felt, going underwater to look for schools of fish.”
“That must have made the Fourth Worlders feel good,” she said, remembering that Adno’s people had little taste for the ironic.
“Indeed. Fortunately, we were strongly entangled and they understood I meant them no harm. They may not be the most subtle species among the Guardians, but they don’t confuse us with the flying fish of their world that prey on them. Anyway, after our long flight here, I think you’ll love the wonderful cooling feel of the water.”
They dove off of the edge of the cliff, circling down against thermals rising from the water. They were only 20 meters from the water now. The wind whipping the water would drown out any conversation, but Salmerikon’s thoughts reached her just fine.
“Watch what I do and follow me,” he thought. And he headed straight down into the water, a plume shooting up almost to her as the water closed around her feet. 
She tucked her wings in and stretched her feet to the sky. The water came fast and pushed her face back into her head, just for a second, and then she was wet and cool and weightless in a world of deep bluish green. She sensed Salmerikon off to her right and watched how he used his limbs to navigate in the water. She turned to follow him down a few meters. Strange spongey rock towers  rose from the bottom, and all manner of small marine creatures swam around and through the holes in the towers. Salmerikon took them closer. The water had currents like the air,  only they were thick and viscous to move through. Everything slowed down. The towers were alive, she could feel their energy. Many schools of fish circled the towers, occasionally passing through each other as if some quantum field kept them from touching. Now and then, the light from above lit up the fish. She was enchanted.
“Come,” Salmerikon’s thoughts said. “Our enhancements will only allow us to stay under for a short time.”
He kicked upward toward the surface, his wings clearing the water and immediately grabbing the air for a lift as his enhanced legs thrust free of the water. She followed suit and amazingly, was airborne again. She let the rising currents take her back to the cliff.
“Wow, why have I waited 400 years to do that?” she said. “That was amazing. A whole other world under our beaks.”
 “Well, I’m glad you suggested this little picnic. Have some rainbow fish.” He passed her a container with several of the small fish, seasoned with herbs. “My life recently has been quite turbulent. Nice to be out here with just you, so quiet and peaceful.”
“I sensed that you had something on your mind,” she said. “What’s going on?”
“I don’t know where to start. I had wanted to talk to you about one thing, and then something else happened and now I’m very conflicted.”
“Maybe I can help sort it out. What was it you originally wanted to talk about?”
 &quot;It may seem odd, after I tell you the second. But anyway, do you know how long I have been a Guardian?&quot;
&quot;Since before I became an ambassador, but no, I don’t know how long.”
&quot;It's been more than eleven centuries.&quot;
Ah, now she understood. &quot;So you will transform soon?&quot;
&quot;In a year or two, I will change to a female.&quot;
&quot;And you’re worried that we cannot be lovers then?&quot;
&quot;Who knows? Our hearts will go whichever way they want. Either way, we will be friends. After our recent conflict, I realized how rare it is to find someone who both loves you and challenges you. And how much I cherish that.”
“And I, as well. In both directions — love and challenge. I think you’ll be a wonderful girlfriend for me, and not my first. So you can rest easy on that score.”
“Good to know. The point is, it has been a long time since I fathered a child. It would mean a great deal to me if you would join with me for that, before I change. It will be a long time into the future before I can mother my own child, and I don’t want to wait that long to be a parent again. I’m feeling the need to leave more behind than just memories.&quot;
In only her fourth century, she had never thought much about birthing a child. Salmerikon was her first lover who had even passed into parent status.
“Wow. My first reaction is, frankly, awe. None of my childhood friends have reproduced. I haven’t had to think about it much.”
“And you may not want to when I tell you the rest.”
He recounted Hankori’s ultimatum.
“Salmerikon, I’m so sorry that it’s come to this. How can I help?”
“Help? I don’t think you can, as far as stopping him. He has won, for now. I will have to find a way to step down, and make it look like I’m just stepping aside for a time. I will remain a Guardian, but a quiet one, while I watch and wait. Hankori, he is another story. I am beginning to believe he is a rare bird.”
“How so?”
“Of course, you can’t repeat this for now. But I believe he is insane, or at the least, mentally unbalanced.”
“How can that be? We were all raised to believe that mental illness had been eliminated thousands of years ago. That our entanglements and our enhancements and all of our technology make it impossible for our minds to go so far out of balance as to be what you say.”
“I don’t know how it can be. But the facts are there and disturbing. His bizarre record on Earth, where most of his prized contacts turned out to be psycopathic dictators like Kim Jong Il — you should read up on him and you’ll understand what I mean. His current project. His penchant for dramatic confrontations. More and more, I’ve come to believe one hypothesis explains them all.”
“So you’ve discovered the true nature of his current project?”
“Not completely. But at least one piece of it I know: he wants to abstract consciousness from the body.”
“Don’t we do that now, when we travel through the wormhole interface?”
“No, not at all. You project thoughts and feelings from your consciousness, but it stays firmly rooted in your body. Imagine if your mind was literally elsewhere.”
“What would be the point?”
“I don’t know. But it seems insane, doesn’t it? To split the mind and body that way?’
“Yes, I agree. And deeply troubling. How can you give the Guardian leadership over to him if that’s true?”
“I’ve thought long and hard about this. We’re not used to dishonest conflict, to sneak attacks. But that’s what Hankori is orchestrating, I’m sure. And at some point, the Guardians who still hold to our original mission must launch a sneak counter attack. Which means feigning surrender in order to eventually defeat him and his allies, whoever they are.”
“You are so brave, Salmerikon. In 10,000 years, no one has had to do this.”
“Sadly, in the nearly billion years since Na’wra’s Explorers discovered other intelligent life and founded the Guardians, situations like this have occurred from time to time, even if not on our world. Part of my initiation as head of the council was to read the ancient archives and to learn how prior leaders met these sorts of challenges. So, what you call bravery is just what I have prepared for quietly for centuries.”
“Call it what you like, it will require courage.”
“And I fear, companionship. When I imagine what lies ahead, you are always in the picture.”
“You know I have deep feelings for you, Salmerikon. I want to say yes to what you are suggesting, even if I don’t know exactly what it means.”
“It means that we would lead a dual life for decades, perhaps centuries. The life people will see is that of two minor Guardian officials, not very important people, going about their work, perhaps raising a child. The life only a few will know is being part of a shadow Guardian organization that monitors and ultimately resists whatever Hankori is planning.”
“I don’t think I should answer this now. This is an occasion to enter alakh, to go deep inside and know my mind as fully as I can. When I emerge from it, you will know my mind.”
“That is all that I can ask now, that you know your mind and be true to it and share it with me.”

            <Text>Preface
A billion years ago
A group of fighters stand on a battlefield, bone weary, dirty, hunger their only nourishment. They can only see a few stars in the night sky through the smoke of battle. The roar of battle is over for now, the world quiet as the remaining armies of all three Houses pause in the carnage that has consumed their world for 30 years.
 In a clearing, one of the fighters stands on hood of a personnel carrier. Naw’ra, a low-ranking officer in the army of the Second House, addresses a a few dozen officers from all three armies.
“Brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, we have fought this great battle for many years. One in three of us who was alive when it started has now fallen. Our air is thick with smoke, our water with blood, and our land covered with our dead, and the dead of all else that once lived here, and with poisons that will kill for years. We have fought each other for land, for wealth, for power, and we have exhausted all three in doing so.
“The three great Houses of U Maw have defeated each other and themselves in the process. I tell you that the soldiers of the Second House will fight no more. I ask the First House and the Third House to put your weapons down. They will help you no more.’
“How nice for you if we do,” shouts someone from the Third House. “I guess you want us to give you our food and children, too.””
“I want no such thing,” Naw’Ra answers, and pauses, slowing her breathing down, remembering that she has come to persuade, not to fight. “I want you to remember that before there were three Houses, there were the clans, and before the clans, there were the bands, and before that, there were just the Maw’u’I, talking animals who could not only imagine the future, but make it real. And in only 150,000 years, they settled all the lands and lived mostly in peace, however simple their life seems to us now. We are those same creatures, but we have lost our way. We let ourselves believe that peace and cooperation was stagnation and that only war and competition brought progress.”
“What do you expect us to do?” shouts a solider from the Second House. “Tear off our clothes and live like savages?”
“Our answer is to move forward. I ask your patience for a minute, and you will begin to understand. I need only your stillness and quiet.” 
Naw’Ra nods, and one soldier in each of the other houses nods in return. She and her two coconspirators anxiously search for each other’s minds. They have quietly honed this skill over many months, but never with so much on the line. Her confidence builds as she feels the first fringes of  the other minds, and then the feeling of profound connection enfolds all three of them.
 As if their three minds have a fourth, their joint consciousness, they encircle the group around them, entangling each soldier into a vibrant mental chord. 
The soldiers gasp, feeling the connection. Now Naw’Ra speaks to them directly in their minds, her thoughts and feelings mingle with theirs. After  drowning in the fear and boredom of battle, there is something about touching the core of so many others that is deeply restorative.
“Yes, you feel it now, don’t you? How little are the differences that have driven us to fight all of our lives. How unfounded are our fears of each other. Now  I know your heart and  you know mine, and we have taken the first step toward peace.”
“Yet we fight for our homes, Naw’Ri,” a scarred old veteran shouts out. “Maybe 50 years ago, we could have all gone home and forgotten it. Now, there is nowhere for most of us to go to, and we fight for the last good lands and waters. What do you propose?”
“You are right, old soldier. We need more — we need a home whose air and water doesn’t bring disease, whose land can support food. Someday, this planet will be that again, but for now, it cannot. Peace must bring progress. And so, our small group from all three houses has been working secretly on a project that will give us a new start. And now we will show you.”
All of them are still now, their minds filled with a strangely different sky, a subtley different landscape. They see a pristine world for the first time. The air tickles their nostrils, fresher than anything they have ever breathed. This new world beckons.
Soliders fall to the ground, stunned and joyful. They are looking through the eyes of a few dozen souls on this new world. They have joined the first people to leave their world. The settlers are from all three Houses. And now they are from none.
“Who are you?” one soldier shouts at the sky. They all feel the response.
“We are your fellow citizens, waiting for you to join us as explorers, and as builders,” says A’mon, from the new world. “Look at the red planet just above your eastern horizon. We are there, yet we can know your thoughts and feelings, too, and you can know ours, as if we were in the same room.”
“Go home to your armies and your leaders,” Naw’Ra says. “Tell them that a new era has begun.  I will train you to entangle and you will train your families, your neighbors, and yes, your leaders.  I have laid down my arms, and so have many others in the three armies. From this day, we are no longer three houses, but one — Guardians of this world. We have been fortunate to have ripped open the fabric of reality and to have seen more deeply into it than anyone before us. And now can begin the work of transforming our lives, our homes, and our future.”

            <Title>Mik meets Ines</Title>
            <Text>It was Decision Day and he had made his. School let out early so they could all celebrate. He waved off Junior and Seanito. He wasn’t in the mood. He hadn’t seen Nila since coffee at Mo’s. Maybe she had actually done it and run away. He hoped she was OK, but he was angry at her and sad for both of them, all balled up together.
His feet pulled him inexorably toward the Broadway Bridge. That was the place where everything had started to really come apart for him. It was just a block long piece of road over a small, occasionally raging, swollen river. Today, though, it was calm. There weren’t even guards at the bridge. But the gates were down, the cameras on and they would be here in seconds if anyone tried to cross into New K.
He still couldn’t figure out why people were killed over this little stream. It looked pretty today, green trees and some early spring flowers along the banks. He could see people on the other side, but they paid no attention to him. I’ll bet New K is way more obsessed with them than they are with us, he thought. They’re just living life.
“Too bad your masters can’t see that way,” a woman said from behind and he turned around. She was standing in a doorway, hard to see unless you were right where he was. She looked familiar.
“We almost met once. I come to your school with Raefe Epstein Miller. I’m Ines.”
He remembered her, walking down the street with Raefe and some other people the day after the attack at this bridge.
“You were the one trying to cross with the zip line, weren’t you?”
“Yes.”
“I was there, you know. They make us kids help watch during the storm. Me and another kid, we were over there.” He pointed to the building where he and Junior had watched that night. “I thought they were going to kill us to shut us up. Cleaning up loose ends, you know? It was outrageous what they did to you.”
She nodded. “So everyone over here isn’t an animal. REM, he preach that. I don’t always believe it. But here you are.”
“What are you doing here? How did you get in?” Suddenly he wondered if he was going to be a human sacrifice for New Kendall’s sins.
“Relax, you’re safe, Raefe sent me.”
“Oh. Why?”
“He wants you to know Nila is safe. She had to leave quick time. The Secs were going to swoop her away.”
“What? Why? She’s just a rebellious kid.”
“They learn she tangles.”
“And they were going to arrest for that? She can’t be the only one.”
“Verdad! But maybe the only one who tangles with REM himself. They were, how can we say, concerned. I think you know they get dangerous when they’re concerned. Maybe not just arrest her either.”
“Oh, man. It’s my fault. She was trying to sort out what to do. We have to pick jobs and she was being squeezed into ones she hated and I told her, maybe she could live on your side and we could still, well…”
“Ah, you care for her. She must care for you, because she strong that someone had to let you know  she’s OK and not to worry. So I don’t think she blames you, either.”
“Where is she?”
“I don’t know. I don’t want to know. This shit is getting real again. The Secs have some tanglers, and they’re coming after tanglers they don’t like, which is everyone else.”
“So you’re with Everywhere?”
“No, not exactly. I can tangle, but I ain’t sold on the whole one big tangled up human race. Some people I definitely don’t want to share my thoughts with, and want to be in their minds even less. You seem OK, though. But to answer, I’m not with Everywhere. I’m a Norcamb — you know all those people out rough up on this end? We rub shoulders with Everywhere a lot. Raefe knows I have ways of slipping in and out of New K unnoticed and his people asked if I would talk to you. I owed him for negotiating with New K over the killings. I would have just got us all killed if it weren’t for him.”
“Nila really digs him. I don’t know what to think. Some days I don’t even know whether to think.”
Ines laughed. “Verdad! So what are you going to be when you grow up?”
He told her about choosing AI interfacer and why.
“Trying to keep your head down. Your shoes, smart move. No need to shame yourself.”
“Thanks. It just feels lame.”
“Be lame if you told me how cool it was. You see all that muck and marsh out there? Fastest person in the world no faster than me running across that.”
“Not sure I follow.”
“The wet world made everyone lame. No prize for first, only for finishing. Go easy, stay easy.”
“Says the woman who hung on a zipline over raging waters to get an old truck across the river.”
“You the sharp one. Yeah, no one said I had any sense. But I grew up in the shit. You just smell it from over here. Different to walk in it every day.”
“Verdad. But I’m not sure they’ll let me stay out of it. I’m finding out there’s a lot they don’t tell you in school.”
“Wouldn’t know. Never been. But yeah, New K lies about everything, in case you were wondering.”
“Was coming around to that point of view. Nila, actually, helped me see a lot of that. But I’m not as brave as her. Or you. I’m just trying, like you say, to keep my head down. Maybe sometimes, though, I want to poke it up and make a difference.”
“I’ll tell the man. That’s Raefe’s territory, organizing shit. I’m just trying to keep my dad alive and the people around me dry. But REM, he always thinking about bringing people into the fight, even just a little.”
“I don’t know how I can help, but I would like to know. Good to have options. And thanks for bringing the news. I miss her already. But I guess I knew this was going to happen, her leaving. At least she’s safe.”
“Yeah, New Kendall can’t grab her up now. She’ll hear about our talk, one way or another. So keep thinking of her. She don’t tangle great yet, but she might get to where she can find you from wherever she’s going. Maybe you tangle a bit?”
“Not really. I think I’m easy to read when I’m relaxed around someone I trust. But I got no way to find them, no way to scan.”
“Interesting. Probably a lot of people like you. That’s one thing Raefe didn’t count on — maybe everyone can’t tangle. Or don’t want to.”
“I’d love to. I just can’t. But yeah, if Nila can reach out, that would be great. I’m not mad at her for leaving. I just miss her.”
“We all got a lot of people we miss. I should go now.” She darted off along the river bank, away from the bridge. She disappeared into a stand of trees and then he couldn’t see her at all.

            <Title>Just doing her job</Title>
            <Synopsis>Aleron introduced. Raefe is switched to a different time line.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Aleron disentangled from the stream. She had stayed connected to Raefe almost to the end, watching as he and Lina clung to a shard of the power dam, battered by the relentless ocean, terrified, waiting for death. It never stopped being impossible, watching the strivings of conscious beings in these terrible moments, but she felt it was not possible to be a Guardian without doing it. 
Now she focused her mind back to the Guardian waveform, she could feel the others  going through the same emotions. She had to calm herself and concentrate on the future. Raef had less than a half hour left. In the corner of her mind that tended to such things, she asked the room to make the walls soothing. They showed a blue green gradient that evoked the sky meeting a forest. She let her mind clear the fear she had felt through Raefe.
“He is strongly entangled, this Raefe. Even near the end, I have rarely felt someone unenhanced as he is so sensitive to the wave function.”
“It is true,” Salmerikon felt, sending her a wash of sympathy. He knew her role as primary contact was draining. “If only more of his kind were as in tune.”
“I sense many are, more than they know. I still believe there is a backbone in this race that may yet overcome the usual obstacles,” she let him know. “After all, they were trying to undo the damage they had done, and not even for personal gain.”
But she could feel a hard strain in the waveform. Some of the Guardians were unconvinced about this place called Earth, these beings called People. She sensed their impatience and wondered why.
“You the People as being on the edge of transition to something better,” Hankori answered. “But I see a very small number of People who fit that description and many more who contribute to their own destruction.”
“You haven’t felt their emotions, you don’t understand how their minds work,” Aleron answered. “They are passionate, they love life. They have not learned how to read their own emotions, but we have guarded many less promising species, and many of them  crossed the threshold past destruction.”
“The simulations back Aleron up,” Salmerikon said. “This Raefe, he can be someone who heals and leads his own species down a better path. But we must act. He doesn’t yet know that the there has been a catastrophic slide of the largest remaining Antartic ice sheet, and that all the oceans will reach equilibrium at 45 feet higher than they were 100 years ago. With all of his promise, he will not be able to effect change with such vast destruction to the coastal areas of this world.”
“This is just what I mean,” Hankori said. “You want us to continue with a world where we only have one contact, who is himself very immature, and is sitting on an artifical rock on a ravaged world where a billion people are going to die in the next year.”
“In this timeline, yes, Hankori,” Salmerikon answered. “But there are many kinder time lines. I have already entangled him with one. Per the usual protocol, he will wake up in a new timeline, unaware of this mass extinction and his own impending death. The simulations suggest that we will have most, maybe all, of his remaining life, to work with.”
“I strongly object, Salmerikon,” Hankori replied. “You have no right to waste our resources on pet projects with no hope of success.”
“Enough!” Salmerikon’s thoughts had become cold and hard. “It is exactly my role to make such a decision. And I cannot fathom why you would object. We know from experience that a species whose time lines vary over so many outcomes is promising.  Many alternate possibilities mean there are many ways for them to succeed, not just many ways to fail. Aleron, you will have some more time to nudge these People away from their precipice.”
She smiled. Such an old word – precipice – harkening back to when the Guardians had not yet left their cliff dwellings, to before they had actually been Guardians, millennia ago when unknown to themselves, other Guardians had shepherded them past the threshold. For an instant, her mind felt her fingers gripping the table they were sitting around, the raw pressure of it pushing aside the warm bath of the wave function her mind lived. She gave herself these little nano-moments – she had to if she was going to entangle with non-enhanced beings like Raefe. She understood that Salmerikon was making her see that Raefe would be terrified, even as he emerged in the new time line, like a man peering out of cave that used to open on flat ground, and now looked out only at a drop off of thousands of feet. She had work to do.
She shifted her attention back to the wormhole interface network, to the node that captured the entangled stream that gathered Earth’s information matrix. One of her enhancements combed the stream of wave functions until she found Raefe’s. He was asleep, thankfully, the exhaustion of catastrophe plunging him into a deep but troubled sleep.
He would awake as if none of that happened, in a world where none of it yet had. It would be the same morning he had awakened only hours before. He would not know nor would he be likely to understand that he was now in a different time line. There would be tiny differences from his old world that might puzzle him, but his species had many moments like that – without enhancement, they were subject to imperfect memories and were easily suggestible.
She found the dream in his mind. He was on the mound of appliances, searching frantically for Lina. If he didn’t find her, he would awake in a panic, his mind still retaining the memories of the very real flood that had happened in his old timeline. They would be imprinted in parts of his mind he wasn’t even aware of, nor could he access them. These panics would return, and seem quite real, and might eventually push him over his own precipice, into madness. Until then, he would waste more time trying to undo his dreaming, listening to Demo. The AI was no more than a blind machine – and a very primitive one at that – as effective as trying to understand a riot of color by measuring wavelengths. The AI could not help him now. She wanted him to feel his potential to connect, to heal.
She found his feelings about Lina and merged them with his dream. Now he turned and she presented herself to him as Lina. She imagined being Lina, and the energy of that flowed through the wormhole and entangled with his thoughts.
In the dream, he smiled at her. She smiled back, and said, “You saved us. We were all goners.”
“But it’s all gone,” he said. “It’’s all water.”
“You can make it fresh water,” she said. “It will sink into the ground and everything will grow back. Kiss me and you will see how to do it.””
He did. That was the first thing he remembered from the dream when he woke up.</Text>

            <Text>Enacting the part
New Kendall
January 23, 2099

New Kendall had gone officially silent about the events at the bridge and REM’s visit. Mik could find nothing on the official stream, none of the independents had anything to say, which was weird. The more he thought about it, New Kendall must have put the word out — this was off limits for discussion.
On the plus side, nothing obviously terrible had happened in the last two days either. No flaming arrows from across the river, no lockdowns in New Kendall. But he couldn’t escape the feeling that some small corner had been turned, something had happened and he didn’t yet know what that was. He was about to message Junior when he realized who he really wanted to talk to, and live, was Nila. She had suddenly gone from being an annoying person on the edge of his world to someone fascinating. When he was very young, sometimes little kids played games where they pretended to be Raefe or Lina and guess what someone was thinking. But this kind of play had to be done out of earshot of adults, and by the time they were school age, most kids had gotten the message that this was not acceptable. 
Now here was Nila, who not only wasn’t just playing at it, but doing it with the man himself. And the real question: were there others in New Kendall who could tangle too, and did they all know each other? And the biggest question — could they teach someone, someone like himself, to tangle? All of a sudden, he felt the need to know the answer to these question.
 He checked her on the net, but she had her location turned off. Should have known — her Sec mom probably made her do that. Secs were strictly do as I say, not as I do when it came to stuff like that. They wanted to know everything about you, but they liked being mysterious.
He remembered she was into the nactor scene, one of a number of fringey things that had made him avoid her in the past. Nactors were sort of like old-time actors, who didn’t really exist anymore since when they were little the movies had switched to using synths, computer-generated actors appearing in computer-generated sets. Of course, he had seen old-time movies but he didn’t see much difference between the old ones and the new ones. 
But not everyone agreed. Supposedly, there was some “human element” that was missing from the synths. And so people would get together and re-enact favorite scenes from their favorite vids. He searched and found a club called, oddly enough, Modern Times, on the edge of New Kendall that sometimes had Friday night performances. What an odd name for something so retro! But there was one tonight, so that was good. And tomorrow was only half a day of school, so his parents probably wouldn’t bust his balls about being out late.
He messaged Nila, saying he was thinking of hitting Modern Times tonight to catch the nactors, but he didn’t know the vid. What did she think? Her reply was cryptic: “Might not be familiar to you, but you should check it out.” He had more hoped for “I’m going, want to hang out?” But he told her he thought he would, indeed, check it out.
All of this prompted a flurry of checking her out on the net, which yielded very little. Yes, she was 17, born in New Kendall, no dad as far as he could tell. If she had a sex life, it wasn’t obvious. If she had a life, for that matter, it wasn’t obvious either. Mystery girl, who are you? He thought of asking around, but he wasn’t ready to broadcast his interest. Sometimes you just had to take a chance.
*****
Modern Times was tucked away on the only land that hadn’t been swamped when a nearby reservoir had begun to overflow from rain a decade or two ago. The road to it was washed out, but not a footpath on the other side of the small hill that it sat on, in what had been some sort of warehouse at one time. The packed dirt path branched off from another unused trail that had carried cyclists during the heyday of auto traffic on Mass Ave. Now it was weedy and the asphalt broken, but not far once you got to the bottom of the hill from Mik’s building.
The inside wasn’t what he had expected. He had seen pictures of old time theaters, both movie and play, with their rows of folding seats, their ornate walls and stage, their sloped floors. This had none of that. Instead, he walked into a spartan cubical room, virtually every surface painted black. At the back were small tables and chairs and a snack bar. At the front, a makeshift stage stood about a foot higher than the rest of the room. Dull metal poles traversed the high ceiling, with half a dozen spotlights attached.
He had been worried that other kids from his school would spot him here and he would have to answer awkward questions. Nactors, after all, were usually a little out there. And while he didn’t really 
mind that, they were one of the many things in New Kendall that you wanted to watch how closely you were identified with. But no matter, because most of the two dozen people here were in their 20s and 30s or older. He found a table on the edge in the back, got himself an apple beer, and tried to look like he belonged. He didn’t see Nila anywhere.
A gaunt looking man called Joshua walked out on to the stage and talked about Undone, the play, as he called the vid, that they were going to re-enact.
“Undone tells a story you have never heard,” he said, “but you know all too well. It concerns ambition, power, and disappointment. If you streamed the vid, you saw a tragedy in which those ambitions are thwarted and an opportunity for humanity lost. In our version, things are a bit different. That’s because Undone is based on a real event which remains shrouded in controversy and mystery, the infamous 2081 attempted crash of the net. While the events portrayed both in the vid and our enactment are imagined, we believe that our version captures the spirit of what actually happened. Without further ado, Undone!”
The room went dark for a second and then the stage emerged in a dim light. People walked on and spoke as if they were the characters, although with some exaggeration of speech and action. This must be what plays were like, he thought, never having seen one. He found himself being drawn in as events unfolded. The main character was a corpo named Roger, but Mik was betting he was old Ken Robertson in disguise. He dreamed of bringing eternal life to himself and his family and friends. Someday, he thought, they would all live as software inside some underground supercomputer where no one could harm them.
About a half hour into it, Mik was still scanning the room for Nila, disappointed that she hadn’t come. And then she walked out on stage. She was a nactor! Now he paid attention as she and Roger began to argue. Her character was Nika, but he was guessing that she was supposed to be Nyssa, Raefe Epstein Miller’s daughter. Now he was riveted to the dialog.
Nika: And what will happen to me when you go underground?
Roger: You will do what people have always done — live, grow old, and die.
Nika: From what I hear, our lives will be diminished. You will be taking enormous resources to prolong the lives of a few hundred people. Above ground, we will be working to keep you alive, essentially, and our children and their children, for as long as the puters can keep your consciousness intact.
Roger: What we do will eventually become available to all people. I am just the first. If you feel you are working too hard on my behalf, remember that you are working to ensure that your descendants, maybe even you, will never have to live in fear again. Fear of disease, starvation, whatever it is that you most fear will take you.
Mik’s ears were burning. This was not the kind of conversation one heard in public in New Kendall, especially about an icon like Robertson. Nila was prowling the stage, as if she was searching for a reply to Roger.
Nika: No, that’s a lie. You don’t care at all what happens to the rest of us.
Roger: How dare you! My whole life has been about improving life.
Nika: Roger, you can’t fool me. I know that your plan is actually to let the rest of us rot, maybe even help that along. You think you and your friends can live in the net while we all fight each other to the death over the remaining habitable areas. But in your arrogance, you never considered that maybe we’re better than that. Maybe we are already learning to live through hardship with each other. Maybe we are calling on the ancient will of our species to survive, not one by one, but together. 
Roger: I will live for centuries. Someday I will remember this moment when all that is left above ground is the burned out corpse of a dead civilization, dead from a lack of discipline and foresight. 
Nika: What a brave little speech! When you go underground, there will be a tombstone to keep you there. You’ll never get away with this!
Nila strode offstage as if off to fetch the army. Other nactors came out and the story moved along. In the end, Roger’s plot was foiled by a cabal of fugees and hackers. Mik was impressed. A lot of it was exaggerated and corny, but it had gotten his attention. He felt strangely emotional, even though he couldn’t name the feelings. Maybe the night hadn’t delivered a special moment with Nila, but he didn’t feel cheated when the lights came back on. The small crowd was cheering loudly.
“You came!”
He looked up to see Nila in front of him, still wearing the clothes she had performed in.
“Yeah,” he said. “Never been to one of these. You were amazing.”
“Thanks,” she said. “I really like doing these.”
“Have you done a lot of these?”
“This is my fifth one where I have lines.”
“Wow, so a veteran. Who are all the people in the audience?”
“Oh, just people who are into this kind of experience.”
“Are they from New Kendall?” he wondered. “It doesn’t seem like a New Kendall thing.”
“Yeah, they’re all locals,” she said. “Although now and then people come in from the north and west. Word gets around. But you’re right, it’s not at all a Newky thing.”
He laughed at her abbreviation of the colony name. “Is that New Key or Nuke-y?”
“Yes,” she answered, laughing, too. “I know you have stuff on your mind. I’ve got to change, but then do you want to get out of here?”
“Sure,” he said. He sipped his apple beer and waited. Things had taken quite a turn and he had no idea what to expect. Nila was 17 and had been a year ahead of him in school for awhile. At some point, New Kendall moved a second group of employees and their families into the enclave, and the classes had been consolidated so that they were now in the same grade. But she would always be older to him. And weirder. And now, clearly amazing. Hopefully, he wouldn’t embarrass himself with her.
And then she was back, very cool in a whole Mekong Survivor look: red Viet short pants over rubber boots, a black bathing suit as a top, and a life-preserver orange jacket. He knew she’d never wear that to school — New Kendall definitely frowned on the whole Swimmer look, no matter that it was the hottest thing on the Net. What did her mom think, though, he wondered.
He followed her out the door and was startled when she took a turn onto a rough path going north, away from New Kendall. She turned around.
“You did say you wanted to go somewhere else, right?” she asked, daring him to clarify that he only meant somewhere other than Modern Times.
“Sure, cool,” he said. She was going to go where she was going to go, so no point in arguing about it. “Where to?”
“There’s a little hill down that way,” she said, pointing vaguely north. “Pretty quiet. And I hacked my mom’s puter and I know Sec doesn’t send any drones this way.”
Soon enough, they were perched on a knoll. There was nothing much out this way, but south you could see New Kendall and Cambridge and a glow from Boston.
“Where are we?” Raefe asked.
“I like to come out here to just wipe the whole New Kendall thing off,” she said. “I guess it used to be called Winchester or maybe Lexington. Kind of nowhere now. The key thing is, Sec can’t find us here.”
“Must be intense with your mom being a Sec officer,” he said, trying to sound sympathetic.
“Yeah, kind of,” she said. “But my mom’s boyfriend, Larry, is even worse. He won’t even say what his job is but I’m pretty sure he’s like a judge or something. She just does what she’s told, but he’s making the rules and deciding who gets whacked and when.”
“Whacked? Really? They really kill people?”
“Probably. But I meant more like who gets screwed — picked up for questioning, fired, deported, that kind of thing.”
“Yeah, you’d have to be on your toes around him.”
“I think that’s when I realized, when I was about 15, that I had some empath skills. I’d say something just to annoy Larry and I’d feel this surge of, almost hatred, from him but he’d say something pretty mild. It clicked that I was feeling his emotions but hearing his voice and he was fronting so my mom wouldn’t freak out. She might be a Sec, but she’s also pretty protective of me.”
“So, in other words, your mom’s boyfriend is a sneaky liar.”
“Just that. But after a couple of years of hearing thoughts leaking from people, maybe he’s not that different. Everybody rehearses what they’re going to say, everybody shades what they’re thinking.”
He blushed. She laughed.
“Don’t worry, I’m not scanning your deepest thoughts. That would be creepy.”
“Empathy, like REM, is that something you can teach?”
“Like, teach you?” she asked.
“I guess, yeah,” he said. “Sometimes I feel like I’ve just landed on Earth. So disconnected, you know?”
“I do,” she said. “But give yourself a break, it’s only human. &quot;
“Yes, I’m good at being human,” he laughed. “Not too much more.”
“It’s a good start!” she said, as if protesting his lack of self estee. “Look, I can barely tangle myself, I doubt I could help that way. But I just know this week has shook you up and you’re wrestling with what it means for you. So am I.”
“And where are you at with that wrestling? Who’s winning?”
“Too early to tell,” she smiled. “But I don’t think New K is in my future.”
“Wow. I don’t know what I think. I’m really worried about what work assignment I’m going to get. I couldn’t take too much more shooting at people. Anymore, really. I don’t know what I’d do if I got something like that.”
“And there are so many other things you would hate, too. We don’t even know half the fucked up things New Kendall does.”
“Like what?”
“Like sabotage anything that might make it better for everyone else at New Kendall’s expense. Larry was out of his mind over the deal they made with Norcamb. He wants to send drones to wipe them out. They were actually discussing painting some of the building materials with germs to make them all sick. The only reason they didn’t is that REM was clever enough to point out to them that its actually a good deal for New K to dump shit from the teardowns in Cambridge. It’s close and cheap.”
“That’s what I mean,” Mik said. “I don’t want to be in that conversation. I’m happy we live in a dry place and aren’t starving. But those people on the other side of the river are desperate. Eventually, they’ll get sick of seeing our towers up on the hill while they’re drowning in swamps. I would.”
“So come with me,” she said.
“To where?”
“Hudson’s Bay.”
“Not what I was expecting. Why there?” he asked.
“It’s a whole new world. It’s been untouched for tens of thousands of years.”
“Right, so now we can screw that up,” he said.
“No!” she shot back. “People are headed up there to make sure that doesn’t happen. Get on the land before the Ken Robertsons of the world do, Do it right — work with nature, work with the indigenous people. Start something completely different, something humans could be proud of.”
He stared at the glow in the south. Ten minutes ago, he had been wondering if they were going to kiss. Instead he was getting an invitation to change his entire life with someone he really didn’t know that well.
“It’s a risk for me, too, you know,” she said. “I like you to talk to and all, but I don’t know you anymore than you know me. I just thought, hey, neither one of is going to fit in here. Maybe having a friend would make it easier to start over.”
He felt that she had thought this through, not him, just the part about never going to fit in. That she knew it wasn’t even worth trying to make a go in New Kendall. It was never going to work, so why waste time?
“Good, you can understand what I’m feeling,” she said. 
“Are you…”
“No, I can’t tangle with you. It’s just that all of our minds leak stuff and I guess I’m a bit of an amplifier. So you got a small dose of what I was feeling. Like when you feel like you can vibe someone, — sometimes you actually can do that, we all can.”
“You’re so sure of things. I wish I was. I don’t know if I can just pick up and go like that. It seems like jumping out of an airplane, or something.”
“Well, think about it, but don’t tell anyone. Not anyone, not even Junior. You just never know in New Kendall. But I’m not going tomorrow. I have to make plans and learn more and so on. We have until the summer before we get shipped off to our work assignments. So I’ll be gone by late spring, most likely. Should we head back?”
They walked back home, talking shit about their friends and teachers, like they were sitting in school at lunch. They came to where she went to her house and he went to his. He started to give her a quick hug but she pulled him toward her and gave him a kiss he would remember.
“And I do like you, you know?” she said, smiling.
“Likewise,” he said. “Talk to you soon.”
Well, he hadn’t embarrassed himself after all. What a surprising night! And there was no one he could tell about it.

            <Text>Ambush
May 18, 2049
Hankori felt the breeze coming up from the canyons, bringing a cool moistness to the plaza. Not many people were around. He had read that this plaza was once part of the last great city on Anonto. When the people of the world had become entangled 10,000 years ago, they found the psychic noise of millions of people packed together intolerable. And unnecessary — with their various and fierce internecine conflicts on the wane, the power of concentration gave way to the sustainability of distribution. They had spread out, like bright paint on a wet canvas, the drops melding and overlapping to form loose neighborhoods.
Pity, he thought. This moment deserves some drama. What it must have felt like for Cresilion, the last emperor of Anonto, to stand atop the ledges, his amplified voice addressing a million people below. Their sweat, their breath, their heat all welling up toward him. And his power reaching down, touching them all. But Cresilion had led the retreat, hadn’t he, from the high civilization of Anonto into the Guardian ethos. Well, what choice did he have? The endless wars, the desolation of the water and food — Cresilion had done what had to be done. Yet, something had been lost, hadn’t it?
And now something more would be gained, but all in due time. He sensed Salmerikon’s approach even before his network bots informed him that the train carrying the Guardian Council chief was pulling into the nearby station. A minute later, Salmerikon was across the plaza, giving a curt wave, his mind closed to Hankori. Well, he’s no fool, is he, Hankori thought. I’d do the same.
Hankori offered him a seat and some alefka to drink. 
“Thanks,” Salmerikon said to the offer. “Nice to have a little boost in the late afternoon.”
“Agreed,” Hankori said. “We’re not middle-aged anymore.” He half-expected Salmerikon to correct him, but that would mean acknowledging that Hankori was, in fact, quite middle-aged while Salmerikon was past the halfway point of his life. But he would make that point later, in a more decisive manner. He let Salmerikon savor the bittersweet taste of his boiled berries, their mild stimulant properties adding to what his enhancements provided, while they exchanged pleasantries. Still, he could not read the old man’s mood.
“What’s on your mind, Hankori,” he asked. “I can’t remember the last time we met like this.”
“I thought a frank exchange of views was in order,” Hankori said. “There’s a lot going on in the Guardian Council these days, and as the two most senior members, I thought we should chat on our own.”
“You’re worried I’ll get in the way of your new lightspeed ship project?”
“Oh, no,” Hankori said. “That’s well underway. It hasn’t escaped my attention that you’re quite interested in it, though. You think I’ve got something up my sleeve, though, don’t you?”
“No, I know you have something up your sleeve,” Salmerikon said, smiling as if he were complimenting him. “And I know it’s something outside of our mission.”
“You see, this was such a good idea. Because it’s our mission that I wanted to talk with you about,” Hankori said, returning the smile. “I’ve always thought of you as someone who sees our mission as that of a watcher and a waiter. And yet I see now that I’m wrong. You, like me, are much more of an activist.”
“You think so?”
“Oh yes,” he said, enjoying himself immensely. “I see now how wrong I’ve been. It hit me like a hot wind rising from a deep canyon at our last council meeting. Everyone was so interested in Aleron and Raefe, but what caught my attention was the girl.”
He paused, but Salmerikon didn’t respond.
“You see,” he continued, “I almost missed it, but then it struck me: how did you re-locate her to a new timeline? Raefe, sure, Aleron had established a connection with him. I may think he’s a dead end on a dead end planet, but he is a natural entangler. She — is Lina her name? — on the other hand, had shown no such talents before.”
“It’s true,” Salmerikon said. “But this was an unusual circumstance. She was with Raefe, who she has a very deep and intuitive tie with. And they were under a lot of stress. Really, about to die — it doesn’t get any more stressful than that. And we’ve seen stress trigger the conversion to being an entangler before. Isn’t that the story of Na’wra? Granted we don’t see it often, but not never.”
He really doesn’t know, Hankori though. This is just delicious.
“We both know that wasn’t what happened. I’m going to save you the embarrassment of continuing this lie.” He let Salmerikon see the data that Anatope had relayed to him of Lina’s conversion. The data stream showed clearly that Salmerikon had orchestrated the whole thing. “You see, I have important and useful friends, too. Even if I don’t spend my evenings with them.”
Salmerikon still had not betrayed any emotion. Ever the leader, Hankori thought, weighing your next move even when you don’t actually have one.
“I can see why you would say that,” Salmerikon said slowly. “But I prefer my version. Anyway, you’ve never been much a stickler for the rules before. I seem to remember certain leaders of one Earth country — North Korea was it? — who became quite bizarre around the time you were ambassador to Earth. I’ve always wondered about that had it in the back of my mind to look into that. Hopefully, your important and useful friends haven’t cleansed the record.”
“My, my,” Hankori said. “I seem to have struck a nerve.”
“No, I wouldn’t say that. I just find your penchant for theater tiresome. What is it you want?”
“I want the Guardians to benefit Anonto. And all the other members, for that matter. I want the Guardians to stop wasting time and resources on doomed civilizations like Earth.”
“Ah, so you can now see both the past and the future, is that it?”
“Sarcasm is my vice, Salmerikon. It fits you poorly. And yes, I can see a bit of the future. I can see that your term as leader of the Guardian Council is coming to an end.”
“You want me to step down?”
“I do. I have no need to discredit you. You can make up whatever story you want. You can take some time to do it. But within the year, you’ll step down. And you won’t involve yourself in the discussion of your successor.”
“I never thought you had the patience to lead the Council.”
“And now I don’t have the patience not to. But I don’t care about the formality — I can work with others.”
Salmerikon stood up, his face still blank. “The future, you will find out, is an uncooperative beast.”
It’s done, Hankori thought. He’s done. Cresilion would have approved.

            <Text>Chapter 6
A little while later, the ‘cane harvester got off. Their car was almost empty and they dozed off for awhile. Raefe slept dreamless and deep, woke as the train came to a sudden halt. His Voice chirped and announced that the train had stopped due to routine maintenance on the track ahead. Wow, he thought, when did the train company start paying for maintenance? Usually they just waited for a break down and then fixed it.
Lina looked like she had been awake for awhile.
“Where are we?”
“Near Richmond, I think,” she said. “But something’s up. Look out the window, to your right.”
There was smoke up ahead, black rolling clouds. Something big was burning, maybe only a kilometer away. They went between the cars, trying to look out, but the smoke was thick up ahead and they couldn’t see past it. He ask his Voice for news about Richmond.
“There are 781 reports of fire, fighting and police activity. How should I focus?” the Voice wanted to know.
“Fighting,” he replied, now getting nervous. Occasionally thieves boarded the high-speed luxury trains, but who would want to jack a solar train? He and Lina had nothing to steal anyway.
“Reports from citizens on local sites say about 200 armed men have attempted to take over Richmond City Hall. These reports are unconfirmed by police or other official sources.”
“What is the government here?” Raefe asked. “Any chance police will come?”
“Difficult to determine,” the Voice answered. “Nominally, still part of Virginia and the United States, but that doesn’t count for much. Richmond is sandwiched between two semi-autonomous corporate tax-free zones — Brightstar Defense to the north, and United Energy Resources to the west — who both want to absorb Richmond, but so far haven’t made much progress.”
Now he was scared. Two hundred armed men? That was beyond a trainjack crew — was this some kind of corporate powerplay they were caught up in?
“Raefe, we should go,” Lina said, her fear palpable.
“Go where?”
“I don’t know, we should find a place to hide. They may board the train.”
“Or maybe they don’t give a soot about the train and we’ll just be making it harder on ourselves. What do we do if the train takes off while we’’re hiding?”
Before she could answer, a gunshot went off close by. The car door burst open and half a dozen men burst in, military guns but ragtag uniforms. Brightstar mercs? he wondered.
“Listen up,” announced a scrawny white man, almost a boy, at the front of the group.  “Richmond, Virginia has been liberated by the Snakehead Militia, fighting for the United States of White America. You are riding a solar train, which is forbidden in our territory. You will be escorted off the train, and taken by truck to a station on the other side of Richmond. In three days, we will repair the tracks and have re-established diesel service and you can catch a fuel train to wherever you are going. If Richmond is your final destination, you are not far. We will put you on the nearest street and you can start walking.”
“Shit, they’re  real, the Confeds,” Raefe whispered.
“We need to get out of here, if we can,” Lina said, trying not to move her mouth. Raefe could feel the sweat on her palms. Just how racist were they? There was plenty of rumors on the net about the Confeds. Wacked out Wyn heads, outlaw diesel bikers, mercs who hadn’t had a job since they were run out of Mexico, the nets couldn’t agree on who these guys were. Except, they were white, as in White.
The platoon herded them off the train and made them line up along the narrow corridor that separated a small forest from the tracks. There were closer to 50 than the 200 reported with the usual net exaggeration. Up close, they looked more sick than dangerous. Pale skin and thinning hair, looking old even at 19 or 20. The water in the coal fields was mostly polluted, it was a heavy metal gruel that slowly sapped the strength of those who drank it, weakening even their genes. They were the last of the last in that part of the country, held there by fear, family ties, crooked preachers and lying corpos long after the land gave up on them.
He could see one of them was the leader. He seemed to have a little spark about him, a luminescence that shone through the dirty pale skin and the greasy hair. He had a T-shirt with a faded picture of a group of bearded men in 19th century clothes, and the words, “Like my brother below me, I took a rebel stand.” He had a nanotat circling his neck. It was off, but Raefe could make out different geometric patterns. 
“What you looking at, white boy?” the Confed said. He shook his head quickly and the tats woke up. Red and black symbols — maybe it was the Confederate flag with Nazi swastikas added to it — orbited his neck. “You’’re in White America, now. What once was lost, now is found – you’re looking at the real symbols of your country.”
Raefe didn’t know if he was joking or insane. Still, he could feel the energy of this kid. Best not to test him. He would have to be careful talking with him.
“See, it hurts me to see a white man scared to see the symbols of his own heritage, and taking comfort with lesser creatures. I told you not to worry, we ain’t gonna hurt you. But your girl friend, she’s going to have to come with me.”
“Go with you where?” Lesser creatures? What planet was this guy on?
“I told you, you in White America now. Everyone else, we got a camp for them on the edge of town. We give ‘em three squares and a cot, not to worry, and send them back to where they came from as soon as we can. We’re good Christians. We keep God’s laws here – and the Children of Ham, we got to help them see their place in God’s plan, you know?”
“I’m standing right here, Mr. White America,” Lina spat out. “You can kill me right the frick here, you pale-skinned, soot-brained son of a goat, if you think I’d go anywhere with you but to your funeral. I know exactly what ‘come with you’ means. I seen that vid already and I don’t care what the frick color you are, I ain’t going nowhere with you.”
“Damn straight!” another woman in the crowd yelled out. People started shouting, and the small band of soldiers was looking nervous, wondering what to do next.  Raefe could feel a small lightning ball growing inside this kid, not sure whether to strike to ground or not.
“What’s your name?” he asked him.
“People call me Jeff Davis,” he replied.
“But that’s not your name is it? He was an original Confederate, I know that. What does your mother call you?”
“Why you care?”
“We got a situation here. I’m trying to figure out where we go from here, and I’d like to know who I’m talking to.”
“Jeff Davis will do for you. The situation we got is that y’all got to do as you’re told, or someone is going to get hurt.””
“Is that what you want? I don’t know what they told you back there in coal country, but people who take the solar train, we’re all poor. These people been through a lot – hurricanes, tidal waves, civil wars and just plain scuffling to survive.  I see you have, too, so I’m going to tell you straight. A lot of these people have faced worse than you, and whatever power you think you have over them, they are going to make you use it.”
Just then, a shot rang out about 30 meters down the track.  A group of passengers had surrounded one of the Snakehead platoons, and one of the soldiers had fired a warning shot in the air. Jeff Davis motioned and he and his men ran toward the shot. Raefe and Lina took the opportunity to melt back into the crowd, which had now swelled into one mass of all the passengers faced off with all of the Snakeheads.
Davis pushed his way to the front. “Everybody calm the frick down. No need for you to be causing trouble here, we’ve explained to you we’ll be processing you shortly.”
“Process my ass, you little shit,” shouted a small, wirey, grizzled older white guy in the front of the passenger’s group. “Who the frick you think you are, you Wyn-loser little sootface? We paid good money to take this train up North so’s we can work and send money back to our families. Most of us looking to catch on with snow crews. Most of us need to be in Hartford, Connecticut bright and early tomorrow for the big New England snow remover shape up or we won’t get on any of the crews. We ain’t got time for your backwoods shit. Now git the frick out of our way.”
More than 50 of the passengers had closed ranks behind him. Some of them had knives, some of them had found pieces of wood or had rocks in their hands.
Davis’ crew looked nervous, but he was standing calm, almost bored. “We regret any inconvenience you may experience, but you are in our country now, and the law is the law. White folks, please walk to the head of the train and board the transportation to your train. Everyone else, you’’ll be enjoying the hospitality of White America for a night, and then we’ll get you on back to where you came from.”
A young black woman and two brownish men of indeterminate ethnicity joined the older white guy at the front. They all had some kind of weapon.
“Shake that coal dust out of your ears,” the woman said. “You must not be hearing us. You do not want to mess with snow ‘sooner crews.  This is life or death for us – our only hope of making it through the winter. We work for months for this fare – salvage, nuclear reactor disassembly, solar furnace repair, whatever shit job you can think of, we’ve been doing it.”
“Lady’s right,” one of the brown men said. “We don’t catch on with a crew tomorrow, our families may not eat. Hell, we may not eat. This ain’t no sim – next time one of you fires a gun, in the air or not, these folks probably just rush right at you and beat you silly before you get those rifles up.”
“Gentleman, I can appreciate the difficulties of living in the sad remainders of the United States of America,” Davis said. “Until we can re-establish the rule of Christian law, God will not grace any of us with a decent life. You are paying for the sins of generations that ignored His teachings and broke with his ways.”
“Listen, boy,” the white man said, “Last I heard, you can still preach that shit on the net somewhere. That’s your play here. Not only are we not going to stand for you messing with our work, but we ain’t going to let you split us up. I might be nothing better than a snow ‘sooner monkey, and I might have only gone to school long enough to learn to read and use the Net, but I ain’t ignorant enough to believe all that White America crap. Besides, you start splitting us up like that, you’re splitting families, best friends, and whole work crews. So step off.”
“I’m trying to get you to see that there’s a new order here,” Davis said. “And a new law, and a new law is the first step we have to take.” He nodded at the boys behind him, and they all came to shooting position. “Now I’’m going to count to ten, and you all are going to turn and march to the front of the train. White people straight ahead, everyone else, you’ll see a path to the left.”
Suddenly the forest along the tracks rustled and several dozen men emerged, rifles pointed at the Snakeheads. They were mostly dark-skinned, as rag tag looking as the Confeds. They all wore black and yellow knit caps. A small tobacco-colored middle-aged man walked up to Davis.
“Son, I believe that one day you will look back on this day and understand it was the beginning of a wiser life for you. And I sincerely hope that you live to see that day, despite your own intentions. And the first step on that road is for you and all your boys to point your rifles at the ground and walk away.”
“No sir. I don’t take no orders from no niggers.”
“My name is Alton Winchester,” the man said. “The rest of your friends in Richmond are gone. The locals drove them out, the fires are under control, the track is already repaired. I know you came here to steal water, but you can’t just take water from other people because you’ve ruined yours. I know you’ll figure that out eventually, but for today, just turn around. Living in that cancer pit you call home, death will find you soon enough. We ain’t about hurrying it along.”
Jeff Davis stared at Winchester. Raefe could almost feel the static electricity between them. But Winchester was having none of it. He returned Davis’ stare with a bemused glance.
“White America will rise again, make no mistake about it,” Davis snarled, as he waved his outmanned group back toward Richmond. “There’’s more where we came from, and not just in the coal fields.”
All the passengers watched them march off, not trusting them. Raefe noticed the New Voodo Army guys all had their rifles down, but their fingers near the trigger. Finally, they heard the unusual sound of a pack of diesel trucks in the distance and figured Davis and his men were headed away.
Raefe embraced Lina. In the two years they had been together, her color had never drawn this kind of fire. He knew it was out there, but coming face to face with it shook him.
“Are you OK?” he asked. She embraced him.
“Yeah, I’m OK. You?” Lina said. She could feel him shaking.
“I guess. No, not really. I know my life hasn’t been like yours, but I never thought of myself as being sheltered. I mean, I’ve been robbed, beat up, met my share of sketchy characters…”
“But you never had a gun pointed at you, for real?” she said.
“Exactly, and that what were they going to do with you?  I thought that stuff died out in the ‘20s, after the Feds put down the white militas.”
“That shit is like mold in the refrigerator. You don’t keep cleaning out rotten stuff, it comes right back.”
“Do you get that shit at home?” Raefe asked. “Do I just not see it?”
“Not much,” she smiled. “But yeah, sometimes. You know your friend Herbert? You ever notice how if he comes over when I’m not around, and then I come in, he leaves pretty quick?”
“No, not really. You think he’s a racist?”
“Yeah, he has two looks he gives me. One, is disgust. The other, he wants to jump my bones and then he’s disgusted with himself that he feels that way about me.”
“Lina, you hardly know the guy.”
“Authentic. But I know those looks, trust me. It’s OK — most of your friends are cool and up where we live, I don’t wake up in fear every day. And you’re right, these Snakeheads would get laughed out of anywhere within 300 kilometers of where we live. Still, I do know the smell of mold.” 
“OK, then, frickin’ Herbert is gone,” Raefe answered, wondering what else was out there below his eyeline. “Let’s go find Winchester.”  
“Que massa, that bird,” Lina replied. “He’s over there.””
Winchester was standing up on a little ridge, eyeing the forest to make sure no one was coming back. Raefe gave him a hug. “I think you just saved our lives.”
Lina hugged him next. “I was ready to die. I kind of lost my mind. First, this paleface starts spewing all this racist yak at me. He was so over the top, I thought I was watching some old vid. Then, the guns, the talk about the camp, I was back in Efricar, in some very bad memories. I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t shown up.”
“We watched from the trees,” Alton said. “We know they don’t have a camp anywhere to take people to, and we weren’t going to find out what they were really up to. We hear maybe they think dark-skinned people are just right to work in uranium mines out west, and they got some kind of deal to ship them out there. Not sure. Just for the record, too, they would have taken everything the white people owned before letting them go. But your snow ‘sooner monkeys shocked them, and I didn’t want to see how that was going to play out. So we moved in.”
“Why were you here in the first place?” Lina asked.
“We’re the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We keep an eye on the Confeds and about a half dozen other racist militia groups.”
“A half a dozen? Is that what you do, scare the scary guys?” Raefe asked. 
“Nah, that just comes with the territory. We’re about surviving the apocalypse.”
“You think there’s going to be an apocalypse?” Raefe asked.
“Going to be? Already been one – didn’t you notice? We’re all in the middle of it. We’re not Christian crazies, we’re not waiting for the heavens to open and God to strike all the sinners dead. The sinners will strike the rest of us dead, we don’t watch out. Like the White America kids, they’re half dead already and they don’t even want to admit it. They let the corpos get over on them, telling them how God wants them to rescue America from the Children of Ham. Robby Koch is who wants them to rescue America, and for United Energy Resources, not God.”
“Robby Koch? The billionaire?”
“More like the son of billionaires. They bet on the wrong horse, three generations of them spending all their money trying to stop what can’t be stopped. He bought the old Biltmore place in North Carolina, put laser turrets all around it, and spend half of what he’s got left trying to start his own country, White America. Coal’s been contraband for 20 years, he’s still selling it to those kids’ families for heating and cooking, telling them God made coal, and coal made America. Meanwhile, his mines and oil refineries and whatnot have poisoned everything in Appalachia.”
“Why did they wander all the way east here, out of the coalfields,” Lina asked.
“They’ve got some insane plan to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia,” Windhester said. “They need that water to turn that coal into chemicals they can sell. The corpos tell these boys a fairy tale about how they’re saving the country, but that’s what this is about. We got word that this train was under attack and we hurried over here.”
“So what’s the NVA’s track?” Lina asked.
“We’re about helping people to understand what’s going on, and what we need to do, and why they should have hope.”
“Every group of six students on our campus says that,” Lina. “Whenever I ask them what that means, they start stuttering.”
“Well, what do you expect? Sister, there is no God, there’s only us, and we have to figure it out. Took a long time to make this mess, and we only got decades to turn it around or we’ll be living like cave men for the next ten centuries.”
“So what’s the voodoo all about?” Raefe wondered.
“That’s a long story, but I’ll give you the short version. In Africa, before white people conquered it, Voodo was a whole system of belief –– science, ethics, harmony with nature, music, spirituality. It was a way to pass knowledge and to practice righteousness, together, as a community. We’re adapting it to the 21st Century. We need a new way of thinking and being, and we can’t depend on the usual means to spread it. So we use the music and dance to spread knowledge.”
Just then the train whistle blew. The snow ‘sooner gang had made sure the train crew got right to it. 
“I have to know more about this. Why the army? What else are you doing?” he asked Alton.
“You come visit me. Sometime I feel an openness from people, a hunger. You’ve got that.”
Eerily, exactly what he had felt in Alton.
“I’ll do it. Where do I find you?”
“We’re on the road for a while,” he smiled, like they were some Afro-Braz band on the last half of their world tour. “After the monsoons, you go to South Staten Island, all the way to the south shore past the old Arthur Kill dumps. You can experience life, Voodo style. You get lost, ask around, everyone knows me. But take these.”
He pulled out two black and yellow watch caps, and gave them to Raefe and Lina.
“You wear them when you come to see me — think of like a security key. Until then, maybe you keep them to yourselves,” he smiled. “We’re not a style -- we like people representing us to actually know what we believe.”

            <Text>Bad dreams
September 5, 2048

People are screaming all around him. He can’t see more than a few feet, but he knows something terrible is happening down near the harbor. He hears metal bending, then shredding. He hears water, lots of it, banging cars around, getting louder, drowning out the screams.
Raefe bolted awake, sweating, temples pounding as they always did when he had these visions. He started the deep breathing exercises the therapy app had given him. This must be the remnants of that hurricane, it’s just a storm. In, out, in and — why is the water getting louder? He can feel the screams of drowning people. He shook Lina.
“Get up! We have to get to the roof.”
He yanked her arm, pulling her up out of the bed. She grabbed at her Voice and they ran up the back stairs in their underwear, yelling “Wake up, get to the roof!” to the other residents of their three-container TinyStack, banging ferociously on the third-floor door as they run by. The water sound was loud now, they could barely hear their feet on the stairs.
They got to the roof, Kiko and Kayam right behind them. They bent into the wind, trying to see what was happening. Hurricane Fatima drove sheets of rain toward them. 
“Look!” Lina yelled over the wind. “The storm wall must be shot.” They can barely see that the usual bright necklace of lights and gates that is the harbor sea wall has disappeared. Huge waves slammed the shore, cars tumbled like driftwood into buildings. The sea has already pushed the Mystic River fast over its banks, churning inland past the TinyStack.
Kiko pointed wordlessly off to the right. A small ship surfed a 30 foot wave, headed from Boston Harbor toward the Mystic Tobin Bridge. The ship twisted and for a minute it looked like it would pass under the bridge that towered 50 meters above it. Then the water threw the boat back into the farthest pillar. A mile away, they heard the sound of the bridge bending over the roar of the water. The pillar bent, twisting the whole bridge. The bending freed the ship and it continued on until it smashed into a building only blocks away.
The streets were 5 meters deep in sea water all around them and dawn was hours away. They look up at the elevated highway only meters above their TinyStack. They found a track for maintenance robots on the highway stanchion. They wedged their feet between the rails and climbed up. The meet a ragged column of survivors on Interstate 93. The rain is everywhere, there is no escape from its driving needles, but they turn their backs on the flood and march north, away from the harbor.
Raefe could barely look at the survivors, freezing, dressed in underwear, pajamas, blankets or nothing, footsteps silent in the wind and rain. His brain was wracked by a kind of lightning that brought a thunder of drowned screams. He put his hand on the back of Lina’s shoulder. His white hand was like a flashlight on her brown back, and he followed it through the rain. 
They get to the top of a big hill. Lina turns around and shakes him.
“It’s OK, we’re safe,” she says. “We made it.”
He nods and wonders, But when will the screams stop? 
They all turn and look back over East Somerville, now a drowned urban swamp. There are no more streets, just dirty water and short buildings like fat trees sticking out of it.
“So that’s what the apocalypse looks like,” Kayam said, his arms wrapped tight around himself.
“Yeah, where’s Jesus?” Lina answered, annoyed.
“No, no Jesus coming,” Kayam said. “Not like that. No free trip to heaven for the true believers. Look around — you telling me this isn’t the end of our world? You think we’re the only people right now standing on a hill looking at something like this?”
“Kayam, stop it,” Kiko said. “Now’s not the time. Come here.” She embraced him, sobs and tears leaking out of both of them.
“Sorry, K,” Lina said. “Didn’t mean to jump on you like that. You know how I am about all that mumbo jumbo.” Kayam waved his hand as if to say, it’s OK, even if nothing is.
“There’s our TinyStack!  Over there.” Raefe said, pointing. He asked what no one has wanted to. “Do you think Miguel got out of the first floor?”
“No way,” Kayam said. “Water was already over back door when we got to the roof.”
“Rest in peace, Migs,” Lina said. “Sorry we didn’t have more time to get to know you.”
“Shit, Kiko,” Raefe suddenly realized, “Where’s your food trike?”
“Serving the fishes,” she said. “You’re going to have to find a new place to get Cubanos and Korean barbecue.”
“Starting to see your point, Kayam,” Lina said. 
Raefe stared at the only home he’s had since leaving his parents. From here, their little TinyStack just looked like bright painted shipping containers stacked under a bridge.
The first light of day brought a dull, gray shine to the city. Traffic was sparse. Lina’s Voice finally found the Net. She sent a text to her parents in Sofricar and gave her Voice to Raefe to call his family. In Raefe’s ear it’s loose, smaller than his, but he jams his finger in to make it work. He talked to it quietly, resetting it to work for him. The Voice took awhile, but it was able to get through to Oregon. 
“Dad, it’s Raefe. Just wanted to let you know I’m OK.”
“Hey, son, so happy to hear your voice. I’m seeing some crazy stuff on the Net — 10 million people homeless, no power to 100 million?”
“I don’t know, Dad. My ‘puters lost in the flood, we had to leave in a hurry. I’m using Lina’s Voice. We just walked all night to get out of the flood. We’re just standing on hill. I’m hoping some cops come by, or any one who knows where we should go.”
“It’s chaos, Raefe. They’re saying the government can’t even find its own people. Digi and Brightstar Defense and some other big corpos say they’re going to help. You know how that works — have a problem and call Brightstar for help, now you’ve got two problems.”
“It just keeps getting, worse, Dad.”
“I’m afraid so, son.”
Raefe could see him, sitting in their apartment in the endless townhouse flats south of Eugene, staring out at the wind farms on the ridge. On the wall, the photo of Justin Miller and Charlotte Epstein holding newborn Raefe, little Benny looking up, standing in front of a brownstone in Brooklyn. He loved that picture. They’re smiling about their future. No one thought that The Slide was only months away. A secret US weapons test in space would cause a massive communications satellite failure. The Net would disappear for six weeks, tipping the creaky world financial system down the long incline it was still on.  Millions of Justins and Charlottes — billions around the world — would never have a full time job again. Nor would they ever smile quite as effortlessly.
“Just tell mom I’m thinking of you guys. I can see that picture on the wall, you smiling at mom.” he said. “Don’t forget that smile. You give mom and Benny my love.”
“Will do. You take care of yourself. And say hi to Lina.”
Raefe turned to Lina and Kayam and Kiko.
“My dad says the Net is crazy with rumors. One hundred million without power, 10 million homeless. Corpos already feasting on the carcass.”
He stood numb, feeling like a giant antenna receiving a million channels, all with bad news. Yesterday he was just another kid struggling to find work and keep it together. Today they were all human driftwood washed up on the new shoreline.

            <Title>New plot summary</Title>
            <Text>Raefe and Lina take the train back. The Snakeheads attack the train as part of their assault on Richmond. The snow sooners resist, a fight ensues, people are shot, they surrender.
Raefe and Lina are taken to a prisoner camp in the Virginia hills. Lina tells him about her rape — this whole thing is a bit of a flashback for her. It’s clear nothing good is going to happen to Lina here. Raefe feels hopeful, he’s not sure why, he focuses on that. Unknowingly, it helps Alton find him. This is all about the power of empathy.
The NVA is a small group inspired by a very big group of the same name in Nigeria. There, they are a group trying to rebuild West Africa after combined eco disasters (oil spills) and decades of either corrupt government or Boko Haram. The NVA in the US has come to Richmond because the same corpos are behind attacks on the NVA in West Africa and the Snakeheads in the US — Mobil Gulf and their subsidiary, United Energy Resources, the last of the Kochs. In W. Africa, they are fronting a new “moderate Sharia” movement that seeks to keep the conservative view of Islam in power, essentially the same partnership between oil companies and Gulf monarchs that has always been.
Renegades are ecstatic — Jeff Davis is their secret weapon.
NVA rescues them. Raefe makes mental contact with Alton — he recreates the feeling Aleron had with him. He tells Alton some of what he is about. They agree to meet soon.
Aleron visits him again and congratulates him on his emerging skills. She helps him understand what empathy is, and the potential social power in it.
They get back to Somerville. Kiki (K&amp;K Deli) is squatting in their Tiny. Kayam has been arrested on trumped up charges because developers want to build in their neighborhood. She is homeless. They let her stay.
Raefe is visited by the Feds. He thinks they want to know about the Snakeheads, but really they want to know about the NVA.He finds he is able to learn much about them just by watching and listening — he is becoming very astute at reading people, again, sort of an enhanced empathy.
Raefe has missed so much school he has to drop out. He visits his parents to tell them.
Renegades are now quite upset that Raefe bested their guy.
At this point, Raefe and Lina have to embark on some course of action. Aleron has to visit Raefe again. TBD.

            <Text>Into the fold

Anatope fidgeted with his tea, remembering that Hanakori was always late. After Aleron’s visit, he had told Hanakori that she had come to visit. Kori insisted they should meet. Too important to let this float in the waveform, he had said. So here Anatope was, looking out over the Red Canyons, sipping bitter tea.
Hanakori appeared around the corner. Strange that he had not sensed him before that, Anatope thought. Kori seemed to glide into his chair, just as a waiter appeared with a glass of water.
“Ah, my young friend,” Hanakori said, “so good of you to come.”
“You asked me to keep an eye on Aleron,” he said. “I thought you’d be interested to hear what she was interested in.” He told Kori about the alternate timelines, leaving out the conversation about Kori’s tenure as ambassador to Earth.
“Her boy must be failing,” Hanakori said, with no small glee. “She wants to know if she can keep him going on some better Earth.”
“Yes, I suspect so. I told her about the history of the project.”
“You did what? Why?”
“Well, she was bound to find out. But I also gave her the impression that she only got the assignment because of her tie to Salmerikon. I don’t think she’s going to want to get too insistent now. She’ll only embarrass herself.”
“True. Thanks for letting me know.” Hankori went still, staring at nothing in particular. Anatope could feel nothing from his mind, which was weird.
“Kori, are you OK?”
Hanakori smiled. “All my friends have called me that only once. Please don’t. Our society seems hell-bent to break down every last barrier between individuals. I prefer to keep some boundaries, and would appreciate you honor the familial part of my name. For me, the history of my ancestors is a source of great pride.”
“Sure,” Anatope said, embarassed. He’d heard this about Kori, but was still surprised that it was true. Everyone had a past, so what? “As you wish.”
“Thank you. But let’s not worry about that. I think this incident with Aleron is a good moment to talk about the future, not the past.”
“Indeed. What about the future?” Anatope asked.
Hankori went away again, just for a second. How does he do that, Anatope wondered. And why? It’s annoying.
“Anatope, my young colleague,” Hankori said. “When you think of our society, what do you think holds it up?”
“Hmmm. I’d never really thought of that,” Anatope said. “I mean, I can see that we exist in a web of cultures, from Anonto’s own to the other Guardian worlds. Bits and pieces of this and that.”
“Yes, true,” Hanikor said. “But entirely beside the point. Our world is built on these things: entanglement, the wormhole interface and enhancement.”
“OK, I see how you get to that.”
“We have had those things for thousands of years, and yet they remain the pillars of our existence. Do you ever wonder why?”
“Well, because they work,” Anatope said, puzzled by the question. “For 10,000 years, we have had no wars, no famines. We live longer and better.”
“What if I told you that we could live forever?”
“I’d ask you why and how.”
“Why? Why not? When I was younger, my mother and father passed. They had not merely given birth to me, in the way of the ancients, and left me to my own. Our minds had intermingled, our thoughts and feelings shared at the deepest level. And yet, they were gone. Later, my own child was killed in an accident — yes, it still happens. And my mates will leave the world, and not so long from now. Why endure all of this suffering?”
“I don’t know,” Anatope said. “I was taught, like everyone else, that there is no alternative. There is no life without death.”
“And who are these gods,” Hankori laughed, “who know how much or how little we may accomplish throughout eternity?”
OK, interesting question, thought Anatope. Kori might seem a little off, but never dull.
“What is it you have in mind?” he asked.
Hankori smiled. “In due time. But for now, let’s talk about the Guardians. Our mission has always been to preserve intelligent life, which seems to be about 20 species in our galaxy.”
“So far.”
“Well, if there are more, they’re doing a great job of hiding.”
This was the great debate among the Guardian species. Where they it for the Milky Way? No matter which timelines Anatope had explored, the number never seemed to change much.
“OK, granted. What do you make of that?”
“That our original mission has to change. That our approach to preservation of intelligent life has stagnated. Tell me, what would we do if some superior species from another galaxy, with technologies that we haven’t even dreamed of, attacked us?”
“We’ve always believed that wouldn’t happen. If they had survived long enough to become that developed, it could not have been on the basis of aggression.”
“Or perhaps we just don’t have the imagination to understand how they could develop that way. Are you willing to bet our future on that, forever?”
Anatope was troubled by this line of argument. Could Hankori be on to something? Why not find out?
“No, I suppose not. What are the alternatives?”
“Now you are asking the right question. The only question the Guardians should be asking and the one question that we so far have refused to even look for the answer to. And you, young Anatope, can help us find that answer.”

            <Synopsis>Raefe visits Alton</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raefe had been walking through the ruins of South Staten Island for two hours, trying to find the New Voodo colony. It was a hard slog. Even though it been 15 years since the Great Iceberg tidal wave had ripped through Arthur Kill and Richmond Creek, tearing Staten Island into two, the giant old landfills were still marshy and treacherous, with the occasional rusty object ready to rip your shins. It would have been nice if Lina was here. At least they could help each other if one of them was injured.
He’d taken Aleron’s advice and not told Lina about his dream. He’d been trying to figure out how to explain coming here on his own, when luck would have it, Lina had picked up a job translating for some East African officials who were touring the East coast. That saved him from lying to her, at least for now.
 He wasn’t even sure what he would do here. Aleron had said that Winchester could entangle, too. How many people could do that? Were their people who could see inside his mind? Would he get better at this, and be able to read their thoughts? The whole thing was a bit overwhelming. People often said something felt like a dream. They really had no idea!
Finally, he saw a grove in the distance. No sooner than he saw it, two men eased out from behind a boulder. One wore the yellow and black colors of the New Voodo Army. He had made it.
 &quot;Hey, we saw you walking this way, and you’ve got the black and yellow cap on. Mind if we ask your business in these parts?&quot;
 &quot;No, no problem. I'm looking for Alton Winchester. We had some email, he's expecting me.&quot;
 &quot;What you want with Alton?&quot;
 Ah, so maybe they thought he was government or one of the corporate security people.
 &quot;He invited me for the water ceremony. Just trying to learn.&quot;
 &quot;Oh yeah, you're in the right place, the man in the black and yellow cap said.  &quot;Alton, he loves to teach. I'm Hector -- that's Robert.&quot; He said it in the Haitian way.
 They walked for a while and Hector led him to a house-sized building made out of old shipping containers.
 Hector knocked and Alton came out. All smiles, he gave Raefe a bear hug.
 “Young Raefe, you are just in time. Come!”
Inside there were about 50 people, sitting on small stools in a wide circle. Alton motioned and two people  made a gap for him. Someone brought him a stool. Alton walked to the center. 
 &quot;When the great flood destroyed our community, we knew that we had angered the World. Not our community, but all of humanity had angered the World, through our disrespect for the water, for the animals, for plants that the sun brings. And so we called upon the forgotten knowledge of our ancestors, from Haiti and from Africa, to help us rebuild this world.&quot;
 &quot;Today, we dedicate ourselves to the Water, to cleanse what we have made dirty, to reclaim the water we have wasted.&quot;
 “Amen!” the circle answered.
&quot;What is the color of the water spirit?&quot;
 &quot;Blue&quot; they replied.
 &quot;Let us make the water blue.&quot;
 Two people brought up a barrel, covered with a sort of funnel filled with a honeycomb. Two more poured a barrel of brackish water. Raefe could hear the slow splash of the water as trickled to the bottom of the barrel. One side of the circle began to sing.
“We take the salt from water!”
And the other side answered.
“We make salt for our food!”
And it continued that way, while some of the children hit tambourines, imitating the slow drip of the water.
“We take the metal from the water!”
“And make tools for our work”
“We take the germs from the water!”
“And make medicines for the sick”
This went on for a while, the singers getting more creative as they went, the children adding a dance to their drumming. Finally, the two people at the barrel raised their arms and the whole room sang “Amen!” as they brought them down with a flourish. The two then lifted the funnel, now heavy with sludge, and marched out of the room.
Everyone gathered by the barrel, dipping small cups to fill them with water. Alton raised his over his head.
“Water, we have made you blue again!” And he drank the cup.
“Blue water!” everyone answered, and drank theirs. Raefe just watched, unsure of what to do.
“Go ahead, my friend,“ Alton smiled. “See what pure water really tastes like.” He handed him one of the small cups.
Raefe dipped it and brought it to his lips to drink and hesitated.
“Ah, you are worried, it seems different, odd,” Alton said.
“I can’t put my finger on it, but yeah, there’s something off.”
“Do you know what pure water smells like?” Alton asked.
“Never thought about it, no.”
“Go ahead, put your nose just above the water and inhale. What do you smell?”
Raefe sniffed. And then inhaled deeply.
“Sorry, nothing.”
Alton beamed. “Do you see now that the water you have drunk your whole life has always had some smell? Maybe it was polluted, or had too many bacteria, or chemicals to make it safe, or salt from the ocean. Yes, it was only a little of those things, but your brain expects a faint smell in water. Even primitive people know not to drink water that smells unless they have no choice. And we, my friend, have had no choice. But now we do, so drink up!”
Alton wanted to show him the rest of the settlement. There were more than a dozen other small structures, all made from shipping containers or scrap metal, or something else discarded that they had transformed into houses.
“What do you see?” Alton asked.
“Honestly, I see a typical drifter camp,” Raefe answered, hoping he hadn’t offended him.
“Exactly!” Alton said, oddly delighted. “Just what the spy sats see. Now let me show you what you didn’t see.”
They walked over to a stand of trees. Close up, Raefe could see that there was a thin band of film about 2 feet high wrapped around the larger branches about a two-thirds of the way up the tree. Thin wires from them spiraled down the tree trunk into the ground.
“These are strain gauge films,” Alton explained. “When they are compressed, the naturally generate a small current. In this case, when the tree bends in any direction from the wind, the films generate electricity. We make the film from scrap plastic in the old landfill and some of the metals and salts from the water – it will take us decades to use it up.”
They walked on to a small pit, filled with an odd kind of grayish mud.
“This pit we filled with four alternating layers of concrete and scrap plastic. We did that four times, to make it as impermeable as possible. Then we filled it with alternating layers of the salts and metals we remove from the water.”
“I get it – it’s a giant battery.”
“Yes, just so. The trees charge this up, and then we use it for our power. We don’t use a lot of power, but we get it all from the trees. We are working on ways to collect energy from the sun, too, but we haven’t yet figured out just how to do that without creating new pollution – a lot of the solar panel stuff can be toxic. But we will solve it, soon.”
They walked around for two hours, Alton showing him all the clever ways they had created a village that was cleaning up the old landfill just by existing. The honeycomb funnel was actually a reverse osmosis gadget that was built from altered plastic milk jugs. The houses were built on piles of old tires that stabilized the marsh. A small portion of the leeches and slugs that were everywhere were harvested and used for bait or animal feed or fertilizer. There was little here that came from the mainland.
Despite the breeze rippling the trees, it was hot and the marshey land lent a steady mugginess to the air. They found some shade and Alton offered Raefe a canteen full of cool water.
“I’m glad I came, Alton. I had no idea stuff like this was happening.”
“Yeah, well the vids ain’t into spreading knowledge much.”
“Authentic. How are you going to really change anything though? I mean, this is great, but there aren’t even 100 people here.”
“Now. But these people will move on, as did many before them. A few thousand people have come here before. Each of them left on a mission, to restore other damaged places like this, other people, and start more Voodo Villages.”
Raefe smiled. “What’s that about, the voodoo part?”
“You’re a college boy, right?”
“Trying to be,” he said sheepishly. “My folks probably wouldn’t be too happy knowing I’m not home studying.”
“See, right there. You got folks, they did what they could to send you to college. Most of these people, they’re wanderers. No home, their families scattered to the winds. These kids, most of them have never been to a school.”
Raefe was skeptical. “Why not?”
“You remember that snow crew on the train? How you think their kids go to school? Their parents go north in the winter, the kids who should be in middle school look after the little kids, the older kids do odd jobs and cook for the other ones. Maybe the take care of the old people, too. They used to come and go in school, when they could, but then most places, they tightened up the rules and too many absences, they toss them. So they went from little school to no school.”
“Man, that’s messed up. Why’d they do that?”
Alton eyed him. Raefe could feel his mind. Was Raefe being naïve or pretending ignorance?
“You’ve got to look at the big picture. The whole world’s playing a game of musical chairs, just waiting for the music to stop. The corpos, the pols, they got chairs with their names right on ‘em. The people who still got regular jobs, who maybe got a house, who might be able to send their kids to college – the want every advantage for them and theirs.”
Raefe felt torn. He knew there was something to what Alton was saying, but it also seemed a little over the top. He’d never heard his parents say anything about depriving other people.
“I gotta say, I was never taught that.”
“Fish never taught the water is wet, but all the same. You were taught it’s a tough world, and you have to work hard, and nobody does you any favors. But if you study, and don’t rock the boat, things will work out. How close am I?”
“Pretty close.”
“You think the people you grew up with work harder than those snow crews? You think these people here, who can turn garbage into water and energy, you think they didn’t have to study? You think if they don’t rock the boat, that college of yours will all of a sudden be full of Haitian rasta kids?”
“No, I got that. I’m not that sheltered, and even if I was, Lina would straighten me out.”
“You just were wishing some of it was true, some of it was real.”
Maybe he was. What could anyone do if everything was a lie, if it was all just bullshit?
“It is a lie,” Alton said, as if he read his mind. “It’s the lie that made the ice melt, the lie that turned California into a desert, the lie that makes white trash still living in the 20th century think it would be even better to live in the 19th century as long as they ain’t the slaves. Whatever’s true in all of that, don’t matter. It’s how we got here, to this time and this place. It’s not how we’re ever going to fix it.”
“How are you going to fix it?” Raefe wondered.
Alton laughed. “Little brother, I have no idea. I’m just doing what I can. And I know I’m not the only one. Do you really think all we can do after 2 million years of evolution is wait for the ocean to cover the world? For all the trees to die?”
Raefe wanted to tell him that it might not work out, that intelligent life had destroyed itself in many places before. But why, he thought? Alton already understood that, on some level, despite his bravado.
“How did you get into this?” Raefe asked him. He half wondered if Aleron had touched Alton, too.
“My father worked for Exxon Gulf, one of the big oil conglomerates. He was a chemical engineer. He was the first black man to become chief engineer for a major oil company. His father was the first person in his family to finish college. His ancestors were slaves. He was a very proud man. He would tell me, ‘Alton, I have a PhD and I’m the boss of hundreds of men and women, of every color, all around the world. But my great, great, however many greats, grandfather or mother, they probably were just as smart as me. Maybe smarter, since they had to survive hell with no help. So don’t you go putting on airs.’
 “In 2021, his company discovered oil in Haiti, which was a giant surprise. He went there to lead the exploration. I was just in school then. In Haiti, the multinationals had schools for their people. But still, I learned Creole from the locals. Then that cholera epidemic hit in ’28, bigger than the one after the earthquake. Bad timing, because the last half of ’28, Hurricane Heather happened. The first hurricane to stall and become a month long superstorm. The winds drove many animals out of the interior forests in Haiti, including bats. So the bat virus came to where we lived, and people were dying in droves. The airlines shut down, and the US Navy patrolled the coast, shooting any boats with people trying to escape. 
“That was when I first understood about the game of musical chairs. In the aftermath, some of the people from the oil companies got together with some of the locals and tried to rebuild. That was when I discovered that the illiterate people that we were living in the midst of were actually quite educated. They knew a lot about nature, about their own history, about how to make a community out of a group of people. But it was all oral. It was all songs and ceremonies. So while we teach the kids here to read and write, we don’t depend just on that. We’re trying to create a culture, one that can transcend all the barriers of language, religion and even class.”
Raefe could feel Alton’s sadness and anger. But he could also feel the steely determination to be better, to be smarter, to be more determined. To be better people, he felt that thought in Alton.
“Just before the New Confederate Army boarded that train, Lina and I were talking about the future. No one wants to talk about the future. ‘It’s too depressing.’’ But why are we even bothering going to college? Why would we even bother to have kids? I feel like I want to do something, but I have no clue about what.”
“I feel your heart,” Alton said. “It’s not pure, but it is true. There are so many little pockets like this everywhere, all struggling to turn the tide, to retake our future from people who only think about being on top, and never about what carnage is under their feet, and how slippery their perch is. We don’t raise our children to be wolves, and we don’t want to be ruled by them either. Hector, he has a saying: every plant can split a rock to find water or sun.”
“Nice thought.”
“Yes, but what does it mean? I know you are asking that. So are we. I think you are one of us, and you are just discovering that. I know you are not going to come live here, I know you will find other ways and other people. Maybe that is your mission, to roam the world and tell all of our stories, to let us know we are not alone.”
“Thank you for saying that, for helping me see that anything is better than nothing. I hope I can do more.”
Alton tussled his hair. “Little brother, you have so much inside you. You keep in touch.”</Text>

            <Text>Chapter 6
A little while later, the ‘cane harvester got off. Their car was almost empty and they dozed off for awhile. Raefe slept dreamless and deep, woke as the train came to a sudden halt. His Voice chirped and announced that the train had stopped due to routine maintenance on the track ahead. Wow, he thought, when did the train company start paying for maintenance? Usually they just waited for a break down and then fixed it.
Lina looked like she had been awake for awhile.
“Where are we?”
“Near Richmond, I think,” she said. “But something’s up. Look out the window, to your right.”
There was smoke up ahead, black rolling clouds. Something big was burning, maybe only a kilometer away. They went between the cars, trying to look out, but the smoke was thick up ahead and they couldn’t see past it. He ask his Voice for news about Richmond.
“There are 781 reports of fire, fighting and police activity. How should I focus?” the Voice wanted to know.
“Fighting,” he replied, now getting nervous. Occasionally thieves boarded the high-speed luxury trains, but who would want to jack a solar train? He and Lina had nothing to steal anyway.
“Reports from citizens on local sites say about 200 armed men have attempted to take over Richmond City Hall. These reports are unconfirmed by police or other official sources.”
“What is the government here?” Raefe asked. “Any chance police will come?”
“Difficult to determine,” the Voice answered. “Nominally, still part of Virginia and the United States, but that doesn’t count for much. Richmond is sandwiched between two semi-autonomous corporate tax-free zones — Brightstar Defense to the north, and United Energy Resources to the west — who both want to absorb Richmond, but so far haven’t made much progress.”
Now he was scared. Two hundred armed men? That was beyond a trainjack crew — was this some kind of corporate powerplay they were caught up in?
“Raefe, we should go,” Lina said, her fear palpable.
“Go where?”
“I don’t know, we should find a place to hide. They may board the train.”
“Or maybe they don’t give a soot about the train and we’ll just be making it harder on ourselves. What do we do if the train takes off while we’’re hiding?”
Before she could answer, a gunshot went off close by. The car door burst open and half a dozen men burst in, military guns but ragtag uniforms. Brightstar mercs? he wondered.
“Listen up,” announced a scrawny white man, almost a boy, at the front of the group.  “Richmond, Virginia has been liberated by the Snakehead Militia, fighting for the United States of White America. You are riding a solar train, which is forbidden in our territory. You will be escorted off the train, and taken by truck to a station on the other side of Richmond. In three days, we will repair the tracks and have re-established diesel service and you can catch a fuel train to wherever you are going. If Richmond is your final destination, you are not far. We will put you on the nearest street and you can start walking.”
“Shit, they’re  real, the Confeds,” Raefe whispered.
“We need to get out of here, if we can,” Lina said, trying not to move her mouth. Raefe could feel the sweat on her palms. Just how racist were they? There was plenty of rumors on the net about the Confeds. Wacked out Wyn heads, outlaw diesel bikers, mercs who hadn’t had a job since they were run out of Mexico, the nets couldn’t agree on who these guys were. Except, they were white, as in White.
The platoon herded them off the train and made them line up along the narrow corridor that separated a small forest from the tracks. There were closer to 50 than the 200 reported with the usual net exaggeration. Up close, they looked more sick than dangerous. Pale skin and thinning hair, looking old even at 19 or 20. The water in the coal fields was mostly polluted, it was a heavy metal gruel that slowly sapped the strength of those who drank it, weakening even their genes. They were the last of the last in that part of the country, held there by fear, family ties, crooked preachers and lying corpos long after the land gave up on them.
He could see one of them was the leader. He seemed to have a little spark about him, a luminescence that shone through the dirty pale skin and the greasy hair. He had a T-shirt with a faded picture of a group of bearded men in 19th century clothes, and the words, “Like my brother below me, I took a rebel stand.” He had a nanotat circling his neck. It was off, but Raefe could make out different geometric patterns. 
“What you looking at, white boy?” the Confed said. He shook his head quickly and the tats woke up. Red and black symbols — maybe it was the Confederate flag with Nazi swastikas added to it — orbited his neck. “You’’re in White America, now. What once was lost, now is found – you’re looking at the real symbols of your country.”
Raefe didn’t know if he was joking or insane. Still, he could feel the energy of this kid. Best not to test him. He would have to be careful talking with him.
“See, it hurts me to see a white man scared to see the symbols of his own heritage, and taking comfort with lesser creatures. I told you not to worry, we ain’t gonna hurt you. But your girl friend, she’s going to have to come with me.”
“Go with you where?” Lesser creatures? What planet was this guy on?
“I told you, you in White America now. Everyone else, we got a camp for them on the edge of town. We give ‘em three squares and a cot, not to worry, and send them back to where they came from as soon as we can. We’re good Christians. We keep God’s laws here – and the Children of Ham, we got to help them see their place in God’s plan, you know?”
“I’m standing right here, Mr. White America,” Lina spat out. “You can kill me right the frick here, you pale-skinned, soot-brained son of a goat, if you think I’d go anywhere with you but to your funeral. I know exactly what ‘come with you’ means. I seen that vid already and I don’t care what the frick color you are, I ain’t going nowhere with you.”
“Damn straight!” another woman in the crowd yelled out. People started shouting, and the small band of soldiers was looking nervous, wondering what to do next.  Raefe could feel a small lightning ball growing inside this kid, not sure whether to strike to ground or not.
“What’s your name?” he asked him.
“People call me Jeff Davis,” he replied.
“But that’s not your name is it? He was an original Confederate, I know that. What does your mother call you?”
“Why you care?”
“We got a situation here. I’m trying to figure out where we go from here, and I’d like to know who I’m talking to.”
“Jeff Davis will do for you. The situation we got is that y’all got to do as you’re told, or someone is going to get hurt.””
“Is that what you want? I don’t know what they told you back there in coal country, but people who take the solar train, we’re all poor. These people been through a lot – hurricanes, tidal waves, civil wars and just plain scuffling to survive.  I see you have, too, so I’m going to tell you straight. A lot of these people have faced worse than you, and whatever power you think you have over them, they are going to make you use it.”
Just then, a shot rang out about 30 meters down the track.  A group of passengers had surrounded one of the Snakehead platoons, and one of the soldiers had fired a warning shot in the air. Jeff Davis motioned and he and his men ran toward the shot. Raefe and Lina took the opportunity to melt back into the crowd, which had now swelled into one mass of all the passengers faced off with all of the Snakeheads.
Davis pushed his way to the front. “Everybody calm the frick down. No need for you to be causing trouble here, we’ve explained to you we’ll be processing you shortly.”
“Process my ass, you little shit,” shouted a small, wirey, grizzled older white guy in the front of the passenger’s group. “Who the frick you think you are, you Wyn-loser little sootface? We paid good money to take this train up North so’s we can work and send money back to our families. Most of us looking to catch on with snow crews. Most of us need to be in Hartford, Connecticut bright and early tomorrow for the big New England snow remover shape up or we won’t get on any of the crews. We ain’t got time for your backwoods shit. Now git the frick out of our way.”
More than 50 of the passengers had closed ranks behind him. Some of them had knives, some of them had found pieces of wood or had rocks in their hands.
Davis’ crew looked nervous, but he was standing calm, almost bored. “We regret any inconvenience you may experience, but you are in our country now, and the law is the law. White folks, please walk to the head of the train and board the transportation to your train. Everyone else, you’’ll be enjoying the hospitality of White America for a night, and then we’ll get you on back to where you came from.”
A young black woman and two brownish men of indeterminate ethnicity joined the older white guy at the front. They all had some kind of weapon.
“Shake that coal dust out of your ears,” the woman said. “You must not be hearing us. You do not want to mess with snow ‘sooner crews.  This is life or death for us – our only hope of making it through the winter. We work for months for this fare – salvage, nuclear reactor disassembly, solar furnace repair, whatever shit job you can think of, we’ve been doing it.”
“Lady’s right,” one of the brown men said. “We don’t catch on with a crew tomorrow, our families may not eat. Hell, we may not eat. This ain’t no sim – next time one of you fires a gun, in the air or not, these folks probably just rush right at you and beat you silly before you get those rifles up.”
“Gentleman, I can appreciate the difficulties of living in the sad remainders of the United States of America,” Davis said. “Until we can re-establish the rule of Christian law, God will not grace any of us with a decent life. You are paying for the sins of generations that ignored His teachings and broke with his ways.”
“Listen, boy,” the white man said, “Last I heard, you can still preach that shit on the net somewhere. That’s your play here. Not only are we not going to stand for you messing with our work, but we ain’t going to let you split us up. I might be nothing better than a snow ‘sooner monkey, and I might have only gone to school long enough to learn to read and use the Net, but I ain’t ignorant enough to believe all that White America crap. Besides, you start splitting us up like that, you’re splitting families, best friends, and whole work crews. So step off.”
“I’m trying to get you to see that there’s a new order here,” Davis said. “And a new law, and a new law is the first step we have to take.” He nodded at the boys behind him, and they all came to shooting position. “Now I’’m going to count to ten, and you all are going to turn and march to the front of the train. White people straight ahead, everyone else, you’ll see a path to the left.”
Suddenly the forest along the tracks rustled and several dozen men emerged, rifles pointed at the Snakeheads. They were mostly dark-skinned, as rag tag looking as the Confeds. They all wore black and yellow knit caps. A small tobacco-colored middle-aged man walked up to Davis.
“Son, I believe that one day you will look back on this day and understand it was the beginning of a wiser life for you. And I sincerely hope that you live to see that day, despite your own intentions. And the first step on that road is for you and all your boys to point your rifles at the ground and walk away.”
“No sir. I don’t take no orders from no niggers.”
“My name is Alton Winchester,” the man said. “The rest of your friends in Richmond are gone. The locals drove them out, the fires are under control, the track is already repaired. I know you came here to steal water, but you can’t just take water from other people because you’ve ruined yours. I know you’ll figure that out eventually, but for today, just turn around. Living in that cancer pit you call home, death will find you soon enough. We ain’t about hurrying it along.”
Jeff Davis stared at Winchester. Raefe could almost feel the static electricity between them. But Winchester was having none of it. He returned Davis’ stare with a bemused glance.
“White America will rise again, make no mistake about it,” Davis snarled, as he waved his outmanned group back toward Richmond. “There’’s more where we came from, and not just in the coal fields.”
All the passengers watched them march off, not trusting them. Raefe noticed the New Voodo Army guys all had their rifles down, but their fingers near the trigger. Finally, they heard the unusual sound of a pack of diesel trucks in the distance and figured Davis and his men were headed away.
Raefe embraced Lina. In the two years they had been together, her color had never drawn this kind of fire. He knew it was out there, but coming face to face with it shook him.
“Are you OK?” he asked. She embraced him.
“Yeah, I’m OK. You?” Lina said. She could feel him shaking.
“I guess. No, not really. I know my life hasn’t been like yours, but I never thought of myself as being sheltered. I mean, I’ve been robbed, beat up, met my share of sketchy characters…”
“But you never had a gun pointed at you, for real?” she said.
“Exactly, and that what were they going to do with you?  I thought that stuff died out in the ‘20s, after the Feds put down the white militas.”
“That shit is like mold in the refrigerator. You don’t keep cleaning out rotten stuff, it comes right back.”
“Do you get that shit at home?” Raefe asked. “Do I just not see it?”
“Not much,” she smiled. “But yeah, sometimes. You know your friend Herbert? You ever notice how if he comes over when I’m not around, and then I come in, he leaves pretty quick?”
“No, not really. You think he’s a racist?”
“Yeah, he has two looks he gives me. One, is disgust. The other, he wants to jump my bones and then he’s disgusted with himself that he feels that way about me.”
“Lina, you hardly know the guy.”
“Authentic. But I know those looks, trust me. It’s OK — most of your friends are cool and up where we live, I don’t wake up in fear every day. And you’re right, these Snakeheads would get laughed out of anywhere within 300 kilometers of where we live. Still, I do know the smell of mold.” 
“OK, then, frickin’ Herbert is gone,” Raefe answered, wondering what else was out there below his eyeline. “Let’s go find Winchester.”  
“Que massa, that bird,” Lina replied. “He’s over there.””
Winchester was standing up on a little ridge, eyeing the forest to make sure no one was coming back. Raefe gave him a hug. “I think you just saved our lives.”
Lina hugged him next. “I was ready to die. I kind of lost my mind. First, this paleface starts spewing all this racist yak at me. He was so over the top, I thought I was watching some old vid. Then, the guns, the talk about the camp, I was back in Efricar, in some very bad memories. I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t shown up.”
“We watched from the trees,” Alton said. “We know they don’t have a camp anywhere to take people to, and we weren’t going to find out what they were really up to. We hear maybe they think dark-skinned people are just right to work in uranium mines out west, and they got some kind of deal to ship them out there. Not sure. Just for the record, too, they would have taken everything the white people owned before letting them go. But your snow ‘sooner monkeys shocked them, and I didn’t want to see how that was going to play out. So we moved in.”
“Why were you here in the first place?” Lina asked.
“We’re the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We keep an eye on the Confeds and about a half dozen other racist militia groups.”
“A half a dozen? Is that what you do, scare the scary guys?” Raefe asked. 
“Nah, that just comes with the territory. We’re about surviving the apocalypse.”
“You think there’s going to be an apocalypse?” Raefe asked.
“Going to be? Already been one – didn’t you notice? We’re all in the middle of it. We’re not Christian crazies, we’re not waiting for the heavens to open and God to strike all the sinners dead. The sinners will strike the rest of us dead, we don’t watch out. Like the White America kids, they’re half dead already and they don’t even want to admit it. They let the corpos get over on them, telling them how God wants them to rescue America from the Children of Ham. Robby Koch is who wants them to rescue America, and for United Energy Resources, not God.”
“Robby Koch? The billionaire?”
“More like the son of billionaires. They bet on the wrong horse, three generations of them spending all their money trying to stop what can’t be stopped. He bought the old Biltmore place in North Carolina, put laser turrets all around it, and spend half of what he’s got left trying to start his own country, White America. Coal’s been contraband for 20 years, he’s still selling it to those kids’ families for heating and cooking, telling them God made coal, and coal made America. Meanwhile, his mines and oil refineries and whatnot have poisoned everything in Appalachia.”
“Why did they wander all the way east here, out of the coalfields,” Lina asked.
“They’ve got some insane plan to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia,” Windhester said. “They need that water to turn that coal into chemicals they can sell. The corpos tell these boys a fairy tale about how they’re saving the country, but that’s what this is about. We got word that this train was under attack and we hurried over here.”
“So what’s the NVA’s track?” Lina asked.
“We’re about helping people to understand what’s going on, and what we need to do, and why they should have hope.”
“Every group of six students on our campus says that,” Lina. “Whenever I ask them what that means, they start stuttering.”
“Well, what do you expect? Sister, there is no God, there’s only us, and we have to figure it out. Took a long time to make this mess, and we only got decades to turn it around or we’ll be living like cave men for the next ten centuries.”
“So what’s the voodoo all about?” Raefe wondered.
“That’s a long story, but I’ll give you the short version. In Africa, before white people conquered it, Voodo was a whole system of belief –– science, ethics, harmony with nature, music, spirituality. It was a way to pass knowledge and to practice righteousness, together, as a community. We’re adapting it to the 21st Century. We need a new way of thinking and being, and we can’t depend on the usual means to spread it. So we use the music and dance to spread knowledge.”
Just then the train whistle blew. The snow ‘sooner gang had made sure the train crew got right to it. 
“I have to know more about this. Why the army? What else are you doing?” he asked Alton.
“You come visit me. Sometime I feel an openness from people, a hunger. You’ve got that.”
Eerily, exactly what he had felt in Alton.
“I’ll do it. Where do I find you?”
“We’re on the road for a while,” he smiled, like they were some Afro-Braz band on the last half of their world tour. “After the monsoons, you go to South Staten Island, all the way to the south shore past the old Arthur Kill dumps. You can experience life, Voodo style. You get lost, ask around, everyone knows me. But take these.”
He pulled out two black and yellow watch caps, and gave them to Raefe and Lina.
“You wear them when you come to see me — think of like a security key. Until then, maybe you keep them to yourselves,” he smiled. “We’re not a style -- we like people representing us to actually know what we believe.”</Text>
            <Notes>The man ignored him and turned to the passengers. “Allow me to introduce ourselves. I’m Alton Winchester, and we are the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We came to defend Richmond from the coal companies. They want to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia.

            <Text>Getting in touch
February, 2099

The shock of Mik’s birthday night faded with each passing week. In its place was a sense that he had changed, saw things more clearly now. He had cautiously asked around if any of the other kids that had been at other checkpoints that night had gotten shit from the Secs. None had — the New Kendall brass seemed eager to move on, not keep the conversation alive. Nila had seen that with her mom, who wouldn’t talk about it at all.
Nila and he, on the other hand, had been doing a lot of talking. He’d told her again that he didn’t know if he would leave New Kendall, but she seemed to take it in stride. Something was brewing between them, he could feel that. He just didn’t know what yet. But he wanted to find out.
That would have to wait. She was off with her mom, who insisted she accompany her to some Sec conference somewhere. All very hush, hush. So it was back with the old gang again this Friday night. First he’d have to go through the obligatory Dinner with the Folks routine.
Not that he hated his parents. Tiffany and Larry were alright, in their own way. Some of his parents friends were far worse. But not more annoying. T&amp;L seemed to think that asking him a million questions was giving him a chance to express himself, to connect with them. The problem was that they only wanted to hear certain answers and it was exhausting trying to figure out what the right ones were.
Tonight they seemed concerned about his occupational choices.
“I imagine the first pass on The List will be out soon,” Larry said, like he had just discovered something vital.
“Three weeks,” Mik replied.
“Any rumors about what’s going to be on it?” Tiffany asked.
“About a million,” Mik said. “The usual: rats for Sec, cannon fodder for Def, marketing, logistics, AI interfacers, eng software monkeys, etcetera. There’s a rumor they’re looking for people with non-English speaking skills.”
“Interesting,” Larry intoned. “Wonder what that’s about?”
“I hear there are problems in Asia,” Tiffany said. “My boss was called into a big meeting last week. Slowdown in production there, someone said.”
They went on with office gossip for awhile, which was fine with him, as he knew nothing and cared less. But then they remembered their Mission in Life, raising a Good Citizen of New Kendall. The son who would make sure that they were taken care of when they could no longer contribute to the corporation.
“Well, anyway, Mik, back to The List,” Larry said. “Anything got your eye so far?”
“I was thinking maybe AI interfacer,” he said, just to keep things going. “Soft eng is too deep — I got lost in that. Lucky to get Bs. But all that AI stuff doesn’t really work right most of the time and they need people to troubleshoot it, go in and see where the algos go wrong. Turns out I’m good at spotting what doesn’t belong.”
“Hmm, I guess that could be good,” Tiff said. “It seems a little boring.”
Unlike all the other jobs, he thought. “Yeah, I suppose. Maybe boring is good,” he said. “Maybe that would leave time for other stuff.”
“Other stuff? Like what?” Larry asked.
“I don’t know. I’m always so busy with school. Maybe once I’m done and working I’ll have time to do other stuff. I don’t know, like be in a play.”
“A play?” Tiffany asked. “Aren’t you about 60 years too late for that? Or do you mean Net plays?”
“No, no, real plays,” he said. “Some kids do them. Seems like fun. Or marsh boating. Or playing an instrument.”
That lay there for a minute until Larry thought of something to say.
“Sure, a man’s got to have his fun,” he said. “I can see that. But I just worry that something like AI handler could be a ticket to nowhere. How do you get promoted from that?”
“Huh, never thought of that,” he said, not wanting to tell him that was exactly the point. Promotion meant having to deal with the higher ups, having to believe the bullshit and be able to recite it back. He wasn’t sure he wanted that kind of attention.
“Well, let’s think about this another way,” Tiffany said. “When you think of New Kendall, I mean the whole corporation, not just here, what do you think of it as?”
“I don’t know,” he said. “Teachers say it’s the world’s largest corporation. It’s everywhere and makes everything. So I thought, OK, everywhere and everything. So seeing how the AI helps steer things, I thought I’d learn a lot about all the things that New Kendall is into. Maybe I’d find something I really like there and I could go with that.”
“Maybe, yes. But New Kendall isn’t just the world’s biggest. It’s the world’s most powerful corporation, probably the world’s most powerful organization of any kind. Do you know why?”
Because they’re willing to shoot anyone who gets in their way, he thought. “Because it’s everywhere?”
Larry smiled. “That’s part of it, sure. And it’s into everything, sure. But old man Robertson, he was the one who first understood that AI could keep track of all the world’s goods and services and use that knowledge to make money in new ways.”
“Because New Kendall always knows where there’s a supply and at what price, no matter what,” Tiffany said. “That’s where I work, in Supply Intelligence. Anything you can think of, we can find it in seconds.”
“And we always know what it’s selling for all around the world,” Larry said. “That’s what Demand Generation does. We partner with your mom’s group. That’s what made us the perfect couple!”
Mik braced for the 1,000 time they laughed at that “joke.” And there it was!
“I just don’t know if I’d be happy doing something like that,” Mik said. “I’m good with numbers, no prob. But I think I’d be bored.” There, he’d said it. And they looked slightly miffed.
“Huh, never been a problem for me,” Larry said. “But maybe you think AI is where the real action is.”
“Yeah, maybe,” he said, actually having no idea.
“It’s not,” Larry continued, satisfied he had snapped the trap shut. “Is that what you want? To be more at the heart of things? Then you should think about Monetization. That’s what make New Kendall’s world go round.”
“I thought they just counted the money,” he said.
“They do,” Tiffany said, “after they figure out how to make it. They put together the intel from Sup Int and Demand Gen and figure out what to buy and where to sell it to make the highest profit. For example, we might discover that there’s a bumper crop of cattle in Siberia because the spring was warm enough, early enough, to lengthen the feeding season and fatten them up. Dem Gen might find out that Korea’s soy crop didn’t do so well and they’re looking for any form of protein and willing to pay for it.”
“But Korea could buy all sorts of things,” Mik protested, “and they have lots of money. Wouldn’t you want to sell it to, say, Spain, because they had such a bad drought this year and their crops failed?”
Tiffany chuckled. “New Kendall is not a charity. Spain also has tons of debt and couldn’t buy that much of the Siberian surplus. Korea can buy it all and is willing to pay 5% over market to get it and freeze it for next year, just in case.”
“So what are the people in Spain going to eat?” he asked.
“That’s the genius of New Kendall,” Larry said. “We’ll locate low-cost crops and sell it to Spain and still make a profit.”
“So, let ‘em eat corn?” Mik asked.
“More like millet,” Larry said. “Beggars can’t be choosers.”
“And that’s the kind of stuff Monetization does?” he asked. “Figure out who to fleece and who to screw?”
“Mik! Why would you say that?” his mother asked.
“Isn’t that what it is?” he asked. “I don’t know if I want to be involved in that. I’ve got nothing against Spain. Or Korea. I just want to stay dry and have three squares a day. And whatever happened to figuring out how to fix the world?”
“What do you think we are doing?” Tiffany asked. “We’re the only thing standing between this broken world and utter chaos.”
Then we are truly fucked, Mik thought. “Oh, I thought we were just making money so we could live better.”
“No need for sarcasm, young man,” Larry said. “If you have a better idea, we’re all ears.”
“I wish I did. But I think at least in AI I’d have some time to think about that.”
“Well, it’s your life,” Tiffany said.
If only, he thought. “Well, I still have time to think it over. I’ll give it some thought. Meanwhile, I promised Junior I’d meet him and the guys up at the Teen Center.”
“Alright, just be home by 10. School night.”
He walked over to the school. In the back, the gym door was open. At night, they let the kids use it to hang out. He found Junior and Manuel and his cousin Seanito.
“Look who showed up,” Junior said. “Nila dump you, or she got her period?”
“Very funny,” he said. “Out of town. No choice but to look at your ugly face.”
“You want a choice? How about kissing my ass?” Junior shot back, but there was no fire in it.
“You must really want some butt love,” Manny said, “looking for this guy to kiss it.”
“Guys, guys,” Mik said. “I got it. I ain’t been down here in awhile and you’re jealous. Let’s not waste this precious time arguing about just how true that is. I’m happy to see you after dinner with my folks, anyway. They seem to think they’re recruiters for New K — getting all up on me about jobs and ambition.”
“I hear you,” Junior said. “You know they just want to make sure you’re happy. And that you’ll have enough Kendall coin to feed their asses when they’re 55 and New K dumps them for somebody younger and better looking.”
“Sounds like the voice of experience,” Manny said.
“We’ve all had that talk,” Seanito said. “Big Sean wants me to follow him into Def. ‘I’ve blazed the trail, hijo. You just need to walk in my footsteps.’ And who’s going to scrape all the bullshit off my shoes walking in them steps?”
“Truth,” Mik said. “My dad thinks I should shoot for Monetization. Which I finally found out what they do.”
“Do tell,” Junior said.
“Turns out they’re the ones who figure out who’s going to get the worst screwing, as far as squeezing people for coin.”
“Oh yeah, my dad told me the same,” Seanito said. “The way he tells it, Sec finds out where the toilet paper is stored, Def goes and steals it, and Money sends texts to all the people on the shitter letting them know how they can get fresh toilet paper for only twice the normal price.”
They all laughed.
“But seriously, what are you guys thinking about doing?” Mik asked, curious. And no one had any more idea than he did.
“Maybe it don’t matter anyway,” Junior said. “Robertson and his guys call the shots. We’re just the drones making it all happen. Red drone, blue drone, what’s the dif?”
“You know they’re going to tell you?” Seanito said. “They’ll sit us down in a few weeks and tell us what the AI recommends. My dad says they give you three choices. They say you can do anything else, but if you don’t pick one of those three, you might get a pretty tough welcome wherever you go. They’ll see you as dead wood from the start, you’ll always have to prove that the AI was wrong. You’ll always be blamed when things don’t go right.”
“Yeah, toss a three-sided coin, Mik,” Manny advised. “Don’t stress about it. Whatever, you’ll get high ground, four walls and three squares. And a free subscription to Kendall Entertainment Network.”
Mik let it go. He could see they weren’t too happy but didn’t want to admit there was nothing they could do about it.

            <Notes>Mik talks with his parents about jobs he might take after graduating. He learns more about what NK is really about and what is choices might really be.

Later, he goes out with the old gang. They all have had this talk, and they recount some of how it went.

He sees that no one is happy, but most are just accepting it. Not everyone though. He’s intrigued by that, although not certain what to do about it.

He realizes that stay or leave, he has to have a cover story. He’ll have to pretend to be choosing between a couple of things just to avoid scrutiny.</Notes>
            <Comments>Not sure about the tone of this section. Too angry? Should they be more “so what have you been up to?”</Comments>

            <Synopsis>Aleron addresses her class</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 11

Aleron stood on her balcony, looking out over the flooded canyons hundreds of meters below. Day was coming to A’Nonto. The breeze brought the first hint of warmth from Prime’s dawn to her face, and decorated the water with a dance of foam, pink in the sun’s rising red light. Higher in the sky, the Twins still shined orange against the black of space. 
She smiled, thinking of the stories the ancients had about their sky. Prime was Mother, and the Twins were First Father and Second Father. The planets were their children. They thought the Fathers were doing a mating dance with Mother, and that the children were approaching her for food.
How could she convey to her cadets what pre-enhanced beings were like? Without that understanding, they would fail in their mission, even with species that were highly scientific, if not yet enhanced. They would not understand what it was like to live entirely in the physical world. They understood emotions and myths – enhancement didn’’t obliterate that – but they wouldn’t really understand the power that either had over the civilizations they would observe and work with.
Today was the start of her term with them. Like all her colleagues, she took part in training new recruits from some of the 11 other species that were currently active Guardians. Some terms came and went, but this term she could share with them her experiences with Raefe. These months of first contact and nurture were often the most delicate, and for them to be able to witness and discuss would be particularly useful to them when they had to do this themselves.
Her group included eight who were A’Mopto, her species, and so were here on this world. Normally, that didn’t matter – all the cadets entangled and their physical presence was irrelevant. She was going to shake things up though. Her time with Raefe had made her realize that certain things had been lacking from their training regimen and she was going to try something new. 
Prime was full now, the sky a soothing pink, and the Twins hot orange spots in the distance. A’Nonto’s brothers,  B’Nonte and C’’Noono, were in night now. Soon they would perform their complex dance across the day, the changing light powering the thermal cycle that all life on the planet lived by. Today, there would be one window of almost two hours that she thought would be just perfect for her class. This was going to be fun!
A few hours later, she dimmed the lights in her quarters and sat upright and alert. She found the wormhole interface network and felt herself join the stream. She found the thread that was her class and soon could feel the 48 other minds that were her students. All would be from the six surface dwellers among the Guardians. The three marine species and the two underground species would each train in their own clusters, at first. For all of these cadets, this would be their first experiences with extended entanglements with other species. Long experience had shown that the sensory differences between different living modalities could be too much for some rookies. Later, though, they would all experience each species’ sensorium. It was vital to developing broad empathy for other lifeforms.
She led them through very basic exercises to be able to identify each other’s consciousness, to send and receive messages. They were bright and quick and took to it at once. They were ready for the next step.
“Excellent! You have all prepared well and will have no trouble being part of this training group. But when you are done with training, and begin the long work of Guarding, you will be working with species that can only communicate in a limited way with you. More importantly, most of you will work with species that have no connection to the stream, or can’’t control what little connection they have. They live in the world all of our ancestors lived in, whether that was 10,000 years ago, as the A’Mopto, my species, did, or one million years ago as you Alaxazayawa did, or only 700 years ago, as the HooHooHu did.
“And that world is one dominated by unenhanced experience of whatever original biologic senses your assigned species have. Maybe they will have some electronic or mechanical aids – mine have computers, books, videos, audios and other means –– but even those they experience through the senses.” She gave them a brief glimpse of what Raefe saw in all these media. 
“Wow!” one of the cadets exclaimed. “These forms are strangely devoid of information, yet so energetic.”
“Yes, everything is sound and color, with no appreciation for frequency and wavelength,” another thought.
“But hard to ignore,” a third added. “And impossible to turn off, at least some of it.”
 “Yes, we can feel the two most important things about these experiences,” Aleron replied. “Yes, they are unenhanced –they don’t have the data context that helps them to understand what they are experiencing. So much more than us, they must process over time – sometimes long periods – to penetrate the surface of their own experiences. Perhaps most importantly, up to 100% of the content of these documents and images are emotional. You will find that ‘impossible to turn off,’ too.”
“What emotions can they have about something they don’t understand?” asked a student.
“You are asking that because you can get to the truth about so many things in a millisecond and then you can form feelings based on how that truth meshes with what you already know and feel. Maybe you don’t always do that, not actually, but you feel that you do. Not so for the unenhanced and unentangled. And this is one of the most important aspects of their lives you must learn to resonate with.
“Because early in every species life, neither the individual nor the species can always wait until they have learned the truth in order to act as they must to survive. So most young species develop a complex system of parallel, intertwining and recursive logic and emotion. To put it simply, ideally they act emotionally, analyze the results logically, and modify their emotions accordingly in an endless cycle. Realistically, emotions can be hard to change, truth hard to find, and yet they still must act to survive. So sometimes they act counter to their true survival needs. That is the primary cause of the failure of intelligent species to survive.”
She could feel their confusion. They had been raised exactly to mesh emotion with thought, to mesh their own perceptions with others. They could not contemplate a life without constant iteration and refinement of their own ideas, a life where blind action was frequently required.
“But today we are going to tackle something much more basic – the physicality of young species. You are all enhanced, you live a rich life full of sensor input and data augmentation. We know that we are still primarily based in physical sensation, and so we each honor that in various ways that help keep us sane and balanced. My species still consumes physical food on occasion. We give birth. You each have your own ways.
“On my world, we play games where we throw a ball and try to hit a target. Some like to do it with very little help from enhancement,” one of the cadets offered.
“Yes, that’s the kind of thing I mean. But you do it for amusement, or maybe out of sense of it being somehow healthy. I want you to consider what it’s like for those who live solely in that way – for species where throwing a rock is how they kill prey for food, for example. Until you can begin to see that,  you will have a lot of trouble establishing rapport and understanding the individuals you contact and work with. But we are going to help you fix that!
“I will tell you a bit of the story of my world, in the way that my ancestors would have told it. Learning origin stories is vital to understanding some of the deep suppositions any species have, so we’ll start with mine. And then we will perform a ritual that marks entry in the adult world for my species.
“First, there was a brood of three, a female and two males, who lived in the sky. Mother, was bigger than the other two and often bossed them around and took their food. So First Father and Second Father flew a bit away from Mother to avoid her.
“But First Father flew back to Mother and she gave birth to a female and two males as well -- A’Nonto and her two brothers,  B’Nonte and C’’Noono. When First Father flew back to Second Father to tell him the joyful news, Second Father grew jealous. The two Fathers fell to fighting and have been circling each other ever since.  They neglected their duties to bring food to Mother.
“So so the younglings never grew and became bright and large, like Mother. Instead, they had to stay in Mother’s nest, forever circling around each other. Still they did grow some, and A’Nonto, in particular, became very beautiful. Mother was red and big, and B’Nonte and C’Noono were small and reddish, but of course not glowing like Mother. But A’Nonto had many colors and textures. She was covered with plants of many colors, and blue water, and brown rocks.
“One day, Second Father, still jealous of First Father’s offspring, could stand it no longer. He saw a family of comets passing by and hurled them at A’Nonto. He wanted to hurt Mother’s prize baby. The comets crashed on A’Nonto, making giant cracks in it, and filling them with the water from the melted comets. When it was all done, A’Nonto had lost much of her beautiful coat of plants.
“All the creatures on A’Nonto ran for the highest ground. They saw that all the land where they had found plants and hunted animals were under water. What remained were water-filled canyons, with steep sides and slippery precipes and small caves for them to live in.
What would they eat? Sandicar, who was young and brave, saw the silver flash of fish in the waters all around him. He dove off the cliff and caught a fish in his mouth. He climbed back up and showed it to the others. Soon, the A’Mopto became a diving and fishing species. Catching the fish wasn’t hard – the A’Mopto are fast swimmers and have strong jaws. But climbing back up the cliffs was hard and dangerous. 
“One day, Second Father disappeared – he was nowhere to be seen. Shortly thereafter, a baby was born whose skin crossed from her back to her arms. When she was old enough to dive, she jumped off the cliff and spread her arms. The air held her up –– she could fly! Second Father felt bad about what he had done and gave the A’Mopto a gift. At first, the flyers worked for the rest, but after many generations, all A’Mopto has become flyers, as we are today.
“In my culture, this is our central myth, our central story. We never have fully escaped seeing things through that lens. And we never have fully lost the desire to jump off a tall cliff and fly. In fact, to prove that, my parents named me Aleron, the same as the female who first flew.
“The species you will work with, there sense of these stories will be much stronger. So I want you to understand the power of your bodies, as they will understand and dwell in the power of theirs. Later we will do the same with emotions.
“My fellow A’Mopto cadets and I will enact the coming of age ritual of repeating the original Aleron’s first flight. We have done this ourselves when we were young, and we had to do it without using enhancement. We will repeat that today, with the exception that we will remain entangled with you. As we return, we will restore some of our enhancement, so that you can understand the speed and power of what we are doing in the usual way. But I urge you to pay most attention to the first part of the flight.
She left her quarters and met the others at the end of the hall, where there was a great ledge overlooking the water. They lined up on the ledge in the customary three ranks of three, with Aleron in the front middle, and next most senior two on her left and right. She let them see the flight path in her mind. They stood for a few seconds, letting the wind fill their extend arms. In threes they ran off the ledge, letting the air currents fill their armwings. Their minds joined with each other, so that the whole group could see what each could see. The other cadets joined with them, too. Each of the flyers absorbed their share of the other cadets, so that the cadets could feel both the individual and group sensations.
It was a beautiful day for a First Flight ceremony. Prime bathed them in warm light, the air currents coming up through the canyon walls were strong but steady. If they had looked up, they would see the Twins and one of the other planets. But their eyes were straight or down, watching the water. She let the all the cadets feel how their arms instinctively made continuous movements to keep them aloft. How occasional breezes buffeted them, sometimes triggering a squirt of fear, and then recovery. Even without enhancement, they could see far and clear as small flashes of silver marked where schools of fish swam below.
She smiled and her fellow flyers knew what was about to happen. Without warning, Aleron tucked her arms in and kicked her feet, releasing the smaller flaps of skin tucked between her three large toes. She used these small wings to guide her descent. All nine rocketed downward in formation, now moving at over 100 kilometers a second. At 20 meters above the water, she led the first rank into a steeper final dive. The second rank passed over them, and the third rank passed over the second rank.
Aleron’s rank hit the water with arms and feet together, plowing into the back of a school of fish. She felt her mouth close around a good sized fish before her legs went under the surface. The school lurched forward, only to be hit by the second rank. The third rank hit a second later. Within seconds, all nine had caught a fish large enough for one meal for one person.
They arched their backs, extend their toes, and let their momentum carry them above the surface. A kick and a surge of their arms launched them just high enough to repeat the motion in the air, and then they high enough to catch the first air currents.
They headed to a ceremonial site on the far shore of the canyon. She turned her attention to the rest of the cadets. They were a little stunned – most of them had never experienced this level of unenhanced physical activity. Only one other species could fly at all without technology. And none of the land dwellers had hunted fish, nor had any of them felt the coolness of water break your dive from 100 meters high.
They landed at the ceremonial site. Before the other cadets could reflect more, the nine each killed their fish with their teeth and handed it to another, simulating first Aleron’s bringing of food for her brood. The others ate the raw fish quickly -- her fellow A’Moptos were not themselves fond of primitive eating. But Aleron chewed slowly, letting all savor the life force in the fish meat, the subtle tastes it had, and the way it felt in her mouth.
Aleron swallowed the last little bit.
“Now, you have seen what it is like to depend on your body to eat and to battle with other life for survival. So when you meet the species you will be Guarding, remember that this battle for sustenance and life has informed their entire existence. Most of them will be much more advanced, but only recently so. These experiences will be embedded in their culture, their minds, their entire bodies. You can help them to see that they can move forward from this, but you cannot pretend yourselves nor ask them to pretend that they can ignore these experiences and impulses. You can only ask them to harness these for new survival challenges.
“And when you come to doing that, then you will fully understand the joy and beauty of guardianship. And you will be truly enhanced.</Text>

            <Text>The Long Game
March 19, 2050
Salmerikon had been dreading this day for months. But now that it was here, he felt oddly calm. Good, he thought, that is what my part of the waveform will feel like. At least he could rob Hankori of the satisfaction of him being visibly humiliated in front of the council he had led for hundreds of year.
The department heads droned through their reports. For months, Salmerikon had tried to rally Tanoch to some enthusiasm over Lina’s conversion of her village to sustain a waveform. Or to Raefe’s leverage of that waveform to make great strides in understanding how humanity’s social and biological evolution were interdependent. Tanoch, who had always been his strongest supporter, merely grunted and nodded with underwhelming enthusiasm. Salmerikon had asked him point blank why he seemed so indifferent, but Tanoch hemmed and hawed and mumbled something about being overwhelmed by his imminent transformation to his species’ hermaphroditic phase.
Then their was Manulo, who had usually been a sensible council member. She was actually quite impressed with the Civilization Project’s final algorithms. Very advanced in some aspects, was how she had put it. Groundbreaking even. But Manulo, as always, was lost in her world of n-dimensional tensors and oblivious to the nuances of normal Council operations. She was barely 200 years old, so maybe time would teach him to engage more with other people. But for now, he saw Salmerikon’s struggles as a distraction.
Salmerikon knew that Hankori had recruited Anatope and Putnomo to his plan. So it was him and two uninterested Council members against this band of three. Not really a winning hand. He suspected that Anatope might someday reject Hankori — the young temporal engineer was basically an honest person and would have trouble with Hankori’s sociopathic tendencies in the long run, he thought. But for today, he was onboard with Hankori’s plan, which was becoming increasingly clear and alarming to Salmerikon. He would keep that knowledge to himself and Aleron, though, and continue to dig until he had the full measure of it.
Hankori was the last of the department heads to give his report. Much ado about nothing, as usual. Maybe being the victim of the first coup in Guardian history isn’t so bad after all, he thought, if it means not having to let this claptrap into his mind.
“Thank you, Hankori,” he said. “Council members, I want to thank you for your reports. And now I have my own report to give.”
There was a minor ripple in the waveform.
“You all know that Aleron and I are having a child together. Sometime in the next decades, I will also transform to female. Both suggest that I can either miss the full joy of either to maintain my Council chair duties, or take another path. After more than 400 years in this role, I have decided to step down from both the chair and the council.”
“What will you do?” asked Anatope.
“I have some research projects that I’ve been working on slowly in the background  for years. And every Guardian Council chair tries to summarize the lessons of his or her tenure, as part of our permanent record. Between that and my personal life, I think I will be productively busy.”
“As head of Administration, it falls to me to lead the process of picking a new chair,” Hankori said. “In the meantime, I’m sure everyone here joins me in thanking you for your service.”
And with that, it was over. Hankori had succeeded, Salmerikon was still in the dark about what his final goal was, and the Guardians were entering one the most dangerous periods in hundreds of millenia.

            <Title>Diver talks to Flier</Title>
            <Synopsis>She tells him what she learned from Adno. He is surprised and interested. He will think about what to do with this.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Far Flier had told Diver that she was going to be absorbed in the Guardian Assembly for weeks, not able to visit Diver’s out of the way cottage. Diver would just have to seek her out. She and Flier had many private routines that they had developed since the struggle with Hankori 20 years ago to maintain some kind of privacy. She knew one that would be perfect for this occasion. She let Flier know that she had a yen for their favorite berry salad, available at a small cafe near the Assembly hall. Flier was agreeable — she’d meet Diver when today’s single sun was highest.
Diver wanted to attract as little attention as possible. She wore very ordinary clothes. She decided not to fly, opting for the train, blending in with all of her fellow citizens. She went a little early. That was their routine when she came to the headquarters area — she would go on her own, and the Flier would pretend to bump into her. They were quite practiced at it, although they knew neither whether anyone was watching or whether they were fooled by the charade. After the events of 20 years ago, they took no chances.
She sat at the cafe, waiting. She realized how sad it was that she was sneaking around here, instead of enjoying the Assembly. They only occurred once every few years and she had always found them highly energizing. Spending time with other Guardian species, learning so much, renewing their sense of purpose — it was heady stuff that she no longer had access to. She remembered the last one she had been part of, just after Raefe had perished in his original timeline. She had led a whole workshop of cadets in understanding less evolved species. It had been a great moment for her, a feeling of standing on the edge of a high cliff, about to glide across a great valley, riding the winds as they swirled upward. And here she was, not even attending the Assembly, sneaking around nearby.
“You are young, my love, you will fly those winds again,” Flier said, appearing suddenly in front of her.
“Oh my, are my thoughts that obvious?” she said, concerned that she was endangering them. She felt Flier in the waveform, not wanting to speak out loud.
“Only to me,” Flier said. “I know the windows to your thoughts that allow the breezes in and out. You needn’t worry.”
Relieved, she offered Flier some berry salad. They sat on the terrace like any two friends, quietly eating their lunch. But their thoughts flowed back and forth along the private channels that they had created in the waveform. She told Far Flier what Anti and Adno had discovered, what she had seen for herself.
“Anti was keen for you to know this,” she let Flier know. “As, of course, am I. Is any of this familiar to you?”
“Not at all,” she said. “And it’s quite embarrassing to say that. After all, I was head of the Guardian Council for some of this. But the Shadow people’s story, that is as ancient to me as to you. Yet it is a stunning tale. The Shadow Rubric — they have that on WaterEye?”
“Yes, they were able to discover it buried deep in the archive. They can help you find it. I think it might answer many questions.”
“And pose new ones, too, I’m sure. And more timely than ever,” Flier said.
“Why is that?” she asked.
“It’s early yet, but I have a feeling that the leadership group will steer the Assembly in a certain way that seems harmless enough. But I sense that what they are talking about is just a smoke screen to hide a different agenda.”
“Such as?” Diver wanted to know.
“It’s not obvious yet. But I’m sure it will be another step toward changing our mission from exploration and expansion to protection and stagnation. Green and his bunch are committed to that direction and skilled in steering us that way. So why should it be otherwise?”
“Do you see the Shadow rubric as changing that?”
“Potentially,” Flier said. “I know you are no longer in contact with so many individuals from all of the other species in the Guardians. You’re not aware of what’s going on with their worlds, either. And some of that is kept from me, too. You can’t believe how dysfunctional and secretive it’s all become. Remember how we used to revel in richness of the waveform? The many funny thoughts from other species, the little bursts of insights we would gain from seeing life from another perspective — like the first time you entangled with Adno’s school?”
“How could I forget that?” she said. “Literally like being thrown into the cold ocean but not drowning. You’re right, though, some of the other, more ordinary moments with other lifeforms have blended together. To be honest, I dwell in the stale air of my own house more than I should.”
“You think that’s your fault, but we all do now,” Flier said. “It’s like we’re already halfway into these bottled, ordered electron clouds they want us to become, or whatever it is they have in mind. And I’m not the only one that feels that way. Here on Traveler’s Perch, the representatives from the other worlds are somewhat acclimated to it. But I know from some of them that people on their home world’s are beginning to sense that something’s changed and they are questioning it. I know Anti thinks that Adno’s people are the one example of a species that doesn’t quite fit with the rest of us. But I think it may not be so cut and dry. For one, I suspect one or two more have also hidden some of their abilities. And perhaps some others know that there are other species on their worlds who are also different, but have great potential to one day become Guardians, even if that’s half a million years from now. But maybe, just maybe, it’s also now.”
“Will you tell them?”
“Somehow, yes,” Flier said. “But I need to think on the best way to approach them. And we need to be extremely careful. I no longer even know who is really the core leadership of this insane immortality cult. Hankori may be just a figurehead now, but his paranoid logic infects them all. I have tried not to obsess about them and so have not observed them as closely or as furtively as we must now.”
“Now you will be glad that I taught you to hunt from the skies,” she smiled. “And Anti reminds me that our ancestors did not hunt alone, that they were clever in the ways they confused their pray by working together.”
“My lovely fish catcher,” Flier said. “Everyone always thinks you’re a little nuts with your interest in the quaint old ways. Maybe you will have the last laugh.”
“I could use a good laugh,” she said. 
They talked a little longer about what to do next. Flier would ask Anti to see the Shadow rubric. Diver would do the same. It was important to take their time, to sink deep into this hidden knowledge until they truly understood it. Then they would know what to do.
Flier had to go back to the Assembly. Diver decided to fly back home, letting the sun warm her back as she remembered the power that she kept hidden under her feathers.</Text>

            <Title>Raefe learns of sec plans</Title>
            <Text>Nila had been back nearly a week and she was still overwhelmed by what she had heard in Chiang Mei. This was not a secret she could keep to herself. She snuck out to the hill she had taken Mick to. She calmed herself, remembering what REM’s mind felt like. When they had tangled, it was a little like intertwining your fingers in someone else’s hands. And she remembered those places in her mind that she had interspersed with Raefe’s mind.
And then he was there.
“Nila, right?” he asked, as if he was talking to her face. “From up on the hill in New K?”
“Yes, thanks for… I don’t know, answering my message,” she said, not sure how to start.
“You’re welcome,” he said, ignoring her awkwardness. “Something is troubling you?”
She started to tell him and he cut her off, sharply.
“Why don’t we discuss this face to face?” he said. “Better all around. Can you be where you are now tomorrow, same time?”
He would find her, he assured her, and broke off. She couldn’t feel his mind anymore.
The next day, he was already there when she was on the hill.
“How did you know I’d be here?” she asked, startled.
“Oh, I guess you didn’t realize that you were sharing what you were seeing. And that you were thinking about how to describe the place to me. So I got all of that. I’ve been in this area before, too.”
“Really. Why?”
“Well, you might not believe this, but I used to come up here to swim in a pond that was here before it was a marsh. When I was just a little older than you. But more recently, there are a lot of small pockets like this up here where New Kendall doesn’t patrol and no one lives in the area. So, now and then, it’s a good place for meeting people out of the glare of New Kendall.”
“Exactly why I come here. I hacked my mom’s Voice and I know they don’t send drones up here.”
“She is a pillar of New Kendall, that must be hard for you,” he said.
“You know her?” she asked, incredulous.
“Not personally,” he said. “Valoris McManus is a person that Everywhere is, shall I say, aware of.”
“Is that why you didn’t want to tangle anymore, yesterday?”
“Sort of,” he said. “I could sense where you were going. And I didn’t want you to put yourself in danger. If New Kendall knew you were in contact with me, that would mean trouble for you. I’m sure you know that. But if they knew you were giving me sensitive information, you could be in serious danger. You understand that?”
She nodded.
“So if you want to back out at this point, I’ll understand. But I don’t sense that.”
“No, I want you to know,” she said. “I don’t want any part of New K. I’m going to run away before they make me a cog in their machine. My mom, Val, dragged me to a Sec conference two weeks ago because she doesn’t trust me on my own. And my dad’s too distracted to really keep tabs on me. They’re both lifers in New K.”
Raefe nodded. “Before you jump in, where was the conference?”
She told him, which made his brow furrow. “Anyway, I was bored, so I snuck into an unused hall near where they were meeting. They want to wipe out the Citizens of Everywhere. For real, once and for all. They see your existence as their major failure.”
“Not figuring out how to heal the planet they so gravely wounded?” he said in mock surprise.
“Shocking, I know,” she said. “But they want to start the new century off with a bang, so to speak. They want to blow your shit up and get you, as they call it, ‘off the board.’ They’ve clearly planning this for awhile. My mom’s group has come up with a device that can keep you from reading their thoughts. And another group has modified that gadget so that it turns your thoughts back at you and fries your brain. I think they watched a vid of a test on a live person , someone from Everywhere. I think they killed him with it.”
He was silent for a minute, eyes far off. Then he looked straight at her.
“We didn’t know about that. You’ve done the right thing. Anything else you might have picked up?”
“Just that they think they have to take some action in Asia. Production’s off or something.”
“OK, that makes sense. At some point, I can explain some of this to you better. But right now, better you don’t know. You have to be very careful. There are tanglers that work for New Kendall, you know. They don’t really understand how it works, but like you, have some natural talent. Sometimes when they’re planning big things, they take extra care to scout for tanglers. So you should be very careful not to let your mind wander into others’ for the next few weeks. You should go back now and not tell anyone about this. I’ll wait awhile and find my own route back, away from New Kendall, so they won’t get the idea that we were both in this area, should they be looking for either of us.”
“Are you going to be alright?”
“Oh, yes,” he smiled. “New Kendall has a lot to learn about empaths. You’ve probably been taught all sorts of nonsense about us. If you want, when things cool down, we can connect more. Maybe it would be better if we found a friend for you in Everywhere, someone closer to your age? You could learn from them  —about tangling, empathy and what Everywhere is really all about. Would you like that?”
“Maybe. I want to leave New K. I don’t know if I’m cut out for Everywhere.”
“You’re thinking more of homesteading, helping the world to start anew?”
“Yeah, something like that. Does Everywhere do something like that?”
“Well, you may not know this, but Everywhere was founded largely among East African refugees from various conflicts. Do you know what the United Nations was?”
“Sort of. Kind of a global government?”
“More like a council of national governments who tried to address international problems. They set up a massive camp for these fugees in East Africa and then had to abandon it. But the fugees came back and secretly occupied it — it was really in the middle of nowhere, and no one noticed. In fact, they called themselves Nowhere — they wanted to stay hidden from different militias that had driven them from their homes. Anyway, they were basically homesteading there. And in some ways, Everywhere was born when they merged with a West African group — from the old Nigeria—that had been doing a lot of eco-farming in a very polluted part of their country. So yes, we have a long history of that, and some projects going now.”
“Anything in Hudson’s Bay?”
“Not yet. That’s been an area for people who don’t like the idea of entanglement, are afraid it will become a kind of mind control. So we haven’t emphasized that, although some empaths have wandered up their on their own.”
She had never considered that everywhere outside of New K was its own world, with its own rules and fears. She would have to learn more.
“Oh, I never thought of that — I thought everyone outside New K was cool with tangling.”
“Right now there’s not much you can say about anything that everyone will agree with, in or out of New Kendall,” Raefe said, chuckling. “In any event, this will be a journey for you, not just to somewhere, but to someone, a new you. I am all too aware of how hard that can be.”
“I guess you’re right,” she answered. “Maybe it will be hard. I was really thinking it would be easier, or at least better, than becoming a zombie for New K. I don’t think I can even bring myself to try that.”
“Probably not,” he said. “In this time, even the easier path can often be hard, though.”
“Yes, that makes sense. And I see it in your face.” She watched the deep lines around his eyes, beginning their downward turn to a frown and suddenly turning upward in a bit of a smile. He wants to encourage me, she thought.
“Then you see, too, that it is our spirit that carries us through these times. Not the promise of wealth or comfort, but the simple and ancient reward of sharing what we can. You will have dark days, and when you do, look to those around you. Some will turn away, but you will feel those who turn toward. And any time, if I can help, think of me. Whether you are part of Everywhere or just a friend, it would be good to keep in touch.”
Kindness without the expectation of return — she wasn’t sure she had encountered that before. “I will, thanks, really,” she said, touched that this old man would give a shit what happened to her. And walked down the hill, on to the path, not looking back in case someone was watching. And trying not to think too hard about what he meant by dark days.

*****
Raefe watched her go and when she had, he let his mind open.
“Were you able to get most of that?” he asked.
“Yes, all of it,” Des said. “All of that was news to me.”
“Me, too. Except for their concern about Asia. I know the Rising Tide has been a thorn in their side. Many of the workers they depend on for food supplies from Asia are either secret Rising Tide or are close with them. And some of the processed food they buy actually comes from Rising Tide catches. So they are feeling more pressure as those sources either restrict what they’ll sell them or charge them more. Two things they don’t like. But the rest, no, that’s out of the blue. And worrying. Do you think it’s possible, what she was saying?”
“Offhand, no. But then she claims they actually killed someone to demo it. At least we know what their goal is — a weapon, not just surveillance or escaping surveillance.”
“And a weapon aimed just at empaths. They want to cut our heart out, so to speak. Where are you now?”
“Southern France. There are some people here trying to resurrect fish farms along the Mediterranean. We’re working with them to see if we can improve on the old ways, lessen the environmental impact.”
“Can you take a break from that to look into this?”
“Absolutely. There are plenty of Everywhere people here and it would be good for some of them to get more experience like this. Give me a couple of days and I’ll turn right to it.”

</Text>
            <Notes>Nila tries to get in contact with Raefe. They meet in the marshes, talk so no one can read their thoughts.

Raefe has let Des know about this and Des listens in. He thinks there’s more to this, that the secs must be planning some kind of roundup of empaths and need the helmets to shield themselves from whatever weapons or sensors they are going to use. He points out that the secs still don’t understand tangling, that they still don’t understand the waveform, think it’s all one to one, point to point. But he’s worried.</Notes>

            <Title>Timelines</Title>
            <Text>Timelines
Aleron was pleased to see that Raefe was integrating the experience well. She’d broken the rules, but at least it hadn’t turned out badly.  Raefe was on a good track now, but would it matter? Her scans of Earth suggested escalating ecological breakdowns. Her scans of the 1,000 or so mild entanglers that she monitored showed definite signs of escalating social stress on humans. A billion years of history had shown those two combinations to be hard to overcome.
Maybe Anatope would know something. She was an ambassador, he was a timeline analyst. He could help her understand what she was up against. They were old friends, so he’d probably not be suspicious of what she was attempting.
“Hey, ‘Tope, I’m hoping you can help me understand something,” she said, emphasizing his familiar name.
“Sure, what do you need?”
“You remember a while ago the council asked me to keep an eye on Earth?”
“Right, the planet that never stops killing itself,” he said.
“Wow, that’s harsh. Why do you say that?”
“You know why they gave you the assignment, don’t you?”
“Because I’m pretty junior and it’s kind of a marginal civilization?” Aleron replied.
“Well, I’ve been saying that all along. But when you were still a cadet, Hanakori first took on Earth. He was an ambassador then.”
“Really? He never struck me as being that interested in other species. I thought he was more of an organization type.”
“Sure, now,” Anatope said. “He’s quite brilliant. He was the first to detect the beginnings of an advanced civilization on Earth. He felt their entanglement powers were weak, but promising. But it didn’t work out.”
“What happened?”
“He was able to make contact with several promising leaders, and they began to build a following. But he didn’t really understand the human makeup — he didn’’t see that some of his contacts were not empaths at all. They were self-delusional characters who thought they had superior abilities to connect with their fellow humans. I believe in their culture they call this a ‘sociopath.’”
She wondered how Hanakori could mistake an empath for a sociopath — a conversation for another day.
“He must have felt terrible,” she said. “How did his assignment end?”
“After a decade of working with them, there was a nuclear war in their year 1962. In your timeline, they call it the Cuban missile crisis because it was avoided, but we had to move more than a dozen of his contacts to more favorable timelines. Or so we thought. Some of them had their own catastrophic wars — the Middle East in 1976, Korea in 2012, Iran in 2017, Pakistan in 2023 — the list goes on. The others we transferred wound up in timelines where there was less war, but the unrestrained economic growth led to faster environmental collapse. Hanakori couldn’t take it —— he resigned and transferred to the administration wing.”
“That’s discouraging. So why did they give it to me?”
Anatope was uncomfortable. “Do I have to spell it out for you?”
“Maybe you do. I’m not seeing it.”
“Al, I know how capable you are. But the truth is, most of the council agreed with Hanakori that Earth was a waste of time. But Salmerikon can be stubborn when he thinks he’s right and he wouldn’t join that consensus. And when he assigned you, well you must know that it’s no secret that you’re more than colleagues. No one was going to buck him. So they voted with him. If it been anyone else, they would have voted it down.””
She considered what he was saying. It wasn’t impossible, but it didn’t feel right. Arguing, though, would only make it worse.
“I don’t know if that’s why I got the job,” she said evenly, ““but it’s certainly not why I’m sticking with it. I’m sorry if you think I’m just here to soothe Salmerikon’s vanity. From where I’m sitting, there is some cause for optimism about Earth. But I need to understand what the timelines show. What am I up against?””
“I can give you some ideas, but I can’t give you too many specifics.”
“’Tope, I’m not an idiot. I’m not going to bring on another Orion Belt disaster, OK?”
“OK, OK, always have to give that little speech about not going back into the past to change the present. So let’s look at Earth across the timelines.”
A column of light rose from the floor, showing the metaverse of the millions of alternative universes that had Earths. Many were very similar and grouped like trees, with common roots but ending in different branches. Anatope was trained to read the timelines, just as she had been trained to read entanglers across the wormhole interface.
“What you see is that at the present, there are several major trees of outcomes. The largest tree shows a steady decline punctuated by various crises — war, famine, disease, all aggravated by out of control warming, predatory social structures, and a variety of lesser ills. In short, the Earth you are currently focused on. There are other smaller trees: runaway warming, leading to a Venusian climate, total nuclear annihilation, escapes to space, most of which fail. I can’t really see beyond 100 years, since there are too many variables in our model.”
“Not very encouraging. In the current tree, are there any signs of hope?”
“Hard to say. Ironically,  in the timelines that failed earliest, there is some regeneration.”
“That’s odd. Why would that be?”
“Well, it looks like in some timelines there was a Third World War right after the Second World War and some nuclear weapons were used. But at the time, there weren’t that many. There were over 300 million people killed. There was more of a nuclear autumn than a nuclear winter.  The near armageddon caused some reflection about the way forward that has yielded some fruit in several time lines. And the increased desire to avoid future catastrophes bled over into tackling the greenhouse gas problem, so climate change has been much more moderate. Plus the nuclear autumn brought them some time on that front.”
“Why didn’t we focus on those worlds?”
“The Earth project started only a few years after those timelines blew up. Our models didn’t show much promise. As we usually do, we went for those timelines that were least likely to self destruct.”
She knew there was something in these humans. To survive partial annihilation on that scale and rebound was a feat on the scale of the U Maw, the first Guardians. Who would be their Na’Wra? Was it Raefe?
“Well, you’ve given me a lot to think about. We’ll talk more.”

Chapter 3, food production. One challenge is that traditional farmers (in the third world) are generally able to sustain themselves historically. But their methods don’t produce surpluses or the right crops for export. What is the future of the global food trade? How does renewable energy change that? 
A second point regards fertilizers, which in general produce nitrogen in the form of ammonia or other nitrogen compounds. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas (200x more than CO2).
In the future, fields may need to be intergrown with rows of trees that provide shade, sequester carbon, and whose leaves become fertilizer. Secondary grown cover crops may also be needed to keep the soil from eroding and to enrich it.
Agricultural irrigation consumes 70% of water usage. But these fields supply 40% of the world’s food supply. Water is being privatized in some places.
One logical conclusion is that the large farm must go — it only exists to create export crops and cannot be managed sustainably. What are the implications of that?
Chapter 5, livable cities. About half of the people living in the urban developing world are squatters living in extreme poverty. 
By 2030, 60% of people will live in cities.
Cities use about 80% of the resources we consume and produce a similar amount of the waste. About 50% of people live in cities. 
P.116, definition of a sustainable city
40% of people live within 40 miles of the sea.

            <Text>Winter Hill
October 1, 2048

All Raefe could see in the dawn light was cool fire. The trees on the hills of East Somerville were in full autumn shades. The sunrise tinted the water between the hills with similar colors. He’d come out looking for serenity and instead found a vision of a world caught between burning and drowning.
“Couldn’t sleep?” Lina asked. She stood behind him, her arms around his waist. He felt her bushy hair at the base of his neck, her breasts warming his back through his shirt.
“Can’t sleep in the glamorous Winter Hill Flood Relief Camp?” Raefe said. “Four star cots, world-class rations, best portable toilets for miles around? Why would you think that?”
“Hey, this too shall pass. We’re alive, at least.”
“Yeah, thanks to my dreams,” Raefe answered, dropping the sarcasm. He turned around to face her. “If I hadn’t woken up at 2AM that night three weeks ago, I wouldn’t have heard the sounds of the water rushing in from the harbor. We wouldn’t have made it up to the roof.”
“But we did and here we are,” Lina said, holding both his arms. “I lived in refugee camps much worse than this for two years in the South African Republic. We can get through this.”
“Because we’ve already gotten through watching the sunrise over an ocean that used to be a mile away and now covers most of where 10 million people used to live. Because no one bothered to maintain the sea wall they built only five years ago after the exact same thing happened to Ireland when the Greenland ice slid into the ocean.” Because we’ve gotten through what  43,000 didn’t, he thought, but couldn’t bring himself to say out loud.
Lina is silent, trying to choose which path to walk  with him — anger, fear, sadness, resignation? So this is what it’s like when you’re 19 and you have to face the unimaginable for the first time, she thinks. Is this how my father felt about me when we left Efricar to go to Sofricar?
“Because we are 19 and our lives may suck, but they’re ours,” she says. “And you, my lovely sweet boy who always takes on the suffering of the world, now it’s your turn to look after yourself.”
“I can’t be as tough as you, Lina.”
“You think I’m some kind of Sim character,” she sighed. “That my superpower is enduring suffering. I’ve just been here before. And I’m not asking you to be someone else. I love that you can see further than the end of your nose. But trust me, sometimes you don’t want to look out too far — the view is too scary. Better to put one foot in front of another. We might have to tough this out for awhile. We’re fugees now, like a billion other people. Are you going to be OK?
“I’m not sure what OK means, Lina. You want me to smile and say I’m fine?”
“I know you’re not fine.  Fine will come but  not now. But there’s a whole lot of life between ‘not fine’ and ‘fine.’ Could be most of our lives.”
I’ve disappointed her again. He sighed. “Sad but true. I’ll do my best.””
“Second best will do, too,” she smiled. “It’s not a test. It’’s cold out here — come downstairs and have some of those world-class rations. We’ve got work detail today.”
After breakfast, their crew trudged down Broadway toward the flood zone. After 3 weeks, the water had receded, leaving most of the streets west of the interstate dry. They went down to their TinyStack a week after the flood but it was ruined, their possessions buried along with Miguel. Thankfully, the Brightstar Defense Services had already removed the corpses. 
 Raefe could still feel the screams of those who didn’t make it. As he replayed the night of the storm, he had come to hear more than just their screams: their shock, their anger, their disappointment as they realized the life they would not lead. Grief is an ocean that still rises over his chest, sometimes he can barely keep his nostrils clear.
That night, he and Lina sneak off to an abandoned furniture warehouse the camp residents called The Club. The camp had separate sides for male and female — if you wanted to meet the opposite sex, you had to go to The Club. They found a couch in decent shape and dragged it to a dark corner. They made love for the first time since the flood, wordlessly, happily, sleepily.
After, he held her face and kissed her. Holding her, he had a deja vu moment, like they had already been here and it had ended with her leaving him. “I know you think I’m a child sometimes,”” he said. “Compared to you, maybe. What upsets me is not becoming a fugee. It’s living in a world of fugees.”
“Authentic,” she murmured, drifting off to sleep.
Something about the peacefulness of her face dissolved his panic. He let himself drift off, knowing they’d still be together in the morning.

            <Text>Winners and losers
March 3, 2049
It was a short bike ride from MiniWorlds to the MIT campus, but for Raefe it seemed like a huge step. He was the third generation of public education products in his family. MIT was the elite world, stuffed with corpo kids who’d been prepped in endless tech camps, by private tutors and private schools. They’d come to become the technical elite of the world in exchange for insane fees and perpetual contributions from their parents. Harvard might still churn out the CEOs and CFOs, but the CTOs and Chief Science Officers came out of here and CalTech and Carnegie Mellon and handful of other places like that.
It was exactly the place that had produced Ken Robertson, who ran DigiBrands, which owned MiniWorlds. Raefe had to remind himself that in this world Ken Robertson had not strong-armed the U.S. government into giving him most of the Northeast to pillage. Not yet, at least. But thinking about his other life in the days following the flood tempered his enthusiasm about venturing into the fold at the ‘Tute, as the students called it. Herbie liked to joke that it was really the Toot, as in tooting your own horn. Herbie collected 20th century insults, although he had a pretty good catalog of 21st century ones, too.
His puter guided him to the Laboratory for Computational Civics, a nondescript three story building tucked into the middle of the campus.



“Hi, is this the Civilization Project?” Raefe asked a rather harried looking woman.
“Yes, yes, and who are you?” she answered.
“I’m Raefe Epstein-Miller,” he said. “From MiniWorlds.”
“Oh, finally someone who can actually do work,” she said. “Everyone here is a big thinker. Very nice until you have to actually get something done. Well, you are in the right place. I’m Roshi Farzan, the team leader for the Outcomes team. You’ll be working with us. Come, I’ll introduce you.”
She took him into a large, messy room full of long tables littered with vid screens and various inscrutable gadgets. No one looked up. In his mind, he had envisioned something exotic — maybe inside a geo dome with vids on every surface. This looked like MiniWorlds if it held a high school science fair and all the robocleaners broke. But the visuals slowly gave way to a feeling of being caught in a stream with a surprisingly strong current. It wouldn’t know you over, but you would have to mind your step.
He realized it was combined affect of a dozen very intent, focused and powerful minds in one place, thinking about related things. It was like being in a room full of Alerons, except that they couldn’t read his thoughts or talk into his mind. Or could they? This will be fun, he thought.
He realized Roshi was smiling at him, bemused.
“They’re not so fierce,” she said. “They won’t bite.”
“No,” he said, “I was thinking more they will. Bite off big chunks of stuff and digest it. Not me — whatever they work on. I can feel that big brain energy.”
“Ah, that,” she said. “Not like where you work?”
“Not exactly,” he said. “Plenty of smart people. But we’re just allowed to eat the little chunks that we can spit out quickly into product.”
“Different product here,” she said. “Ours is insight — takes time and luck. Anyway, we need your help and I think you’ll find it engaging. Let me introduce you to your team members.”
Who, it turned out, were a guy named Jim and a woman named Elise. The four of them sat around a small table in the corner — the Lab’s version of a conference room.
“Elise works on quantitative sociology and Jim on simulation kinetics,” Roshi said. Raefe had no idea what that meant, but nodded. Not going to do the whole “I’m just a state school kid” thing,” he thought.
“What that means in this context,” Elise said, “is that I look at factors that have contributed to the rise and fall of societies — civilizations — and Jim develops math that represents those factors.”
“And what we’re hoping you’ll be able to do,” Jim said, “is translate that math into an interactive, game-like environment.”
“And why do you want to do that?” asked Raefe.
“Are you familiar with the Universal Standard Model sim?” Jim replied.
“A bit,” Raefe replied. “It’s everything we know about physics applied to a sim of the history of the cosmos. I seem to remember using it in science class in high school.”
“That was the public version,” Jim said. “The thing is, we don’t know everything about physics. So if you run the universe from the Big Bang to now, the sim will always violate something we already know as true or false unless you rig the sim. There’s a research version where astrophysicists can tinker with stuff, inject new variables, factors, particles and so on that they’re researching. And see if their presence or behavior gets us closer to reality.”
“I get that,” Raefe said. “That’s why anyone would use a sim. But why the game part?”
“Because CivLab is about people,” Elise said. “We want to be able, for example, to ask people to play through different phases of history and see how their behavior changes outcomes. And even interview them about why they did what they did. Some people even want to watch their brains as they play — how much of their actions are driven by logic, how much by emotion?”
“Cool,” Raefe said. “Well, I’m sure I can help. I’ve built dozens of game frameworks for hundreds of games and even some self-generating animated vids. We’ll have to get deeper into how you want them to interact, how many people and so on. But that sounds exciting. Most of the games I help build are either about guns or money — is that the kind of stuff you’re looking at?”
“Part of it. But we want to look deeper into issues like competition and collaboration, heirarchy and equality, scarcity and plenty. How does that effect the role of guns and money, for example, in how a society works?”
“Nice,” Raefe said. “I’m a little bored of creating counters for bodies or coins.”

            <Title>Nila leaves</Title>
            <Text>The spring air felt good to Nila. The winter had mostly hovered in the 40s but the frequent storms had made it cold and raw. In a month or two, the swampy weather would take hold. But for now, it was just on the warm side and the sun felt good on her face. The Torn Nets were in her ears, the nasal twang and infectious tuned drums of Filipino reggae adding to the smile on her face. She wondered if the Secs understood the Nets words. All those songs about fish swimming free — did they get that we were the fish?
That’s what was so exhausting about New K. You could never just relax and enjoy yourself. Was someone watching, listening? And what were they looking for? And did it matter? Well, she wasn’t going to let them spoil her afternoon. Mik would be here soon and hang out and just not worry about it all.
And there he was, his gangly self, his messy hair, and those soulful eyes. Maybe it wasn’t forever, but she did like him.
“Oye, amiga,” he said. “How are you?”
“Loving this weather,” she said. “You want to grab a java at Mo’s? We could sit outside.”
They walked a few blocks from Mass Ave to Mohammed’s Coffee and Cake, which had the benefit of having neither other kids or New K brass as frequent visitors. Some of the teachers went there, but they never talked to you off hours anyway.
“So what you been up to?” Mik asked after they had gotten their coffees.
“Oh, this and that. They’ve been screening old vids at Modern Times. We watched one about these enactors, well actors back then, who are travelling around doing plays after this plague kills off most of the world.”
“Yikes, that sounds grim,” Mik said.
“The plague, yeah. They didn’t have all the drugs we have now, so they couldn’t fix it. But otherwise, it reminded me of that virus in 2091.”
“Yeah, that sucked. Did you get that?”
“Yup. Why do you think I’m a year older than everyone else? I was sick for half a year. My mom says I could have died.”
“Wow, I didn’t realize that. You weren’t here then, were you?”
“No, Val got posted to Finland, of all places. Pretty quiet up there, just a lot of swamp, mostly. But then it turned out there are these biker gangs that travel across the old Arctic lands, smuggling shit. Mostly drugs. The go from Siberia all the way to Norway. On their way through Finland, they managed to pass the virus on and before anyone knew it, it was everywhere. My mom claims that New K saved my life, that they air-dropped in experimental drugs before everyone else got them.”
“What was it like? When you had the virus.”
“I don’t remember the first part. I was delirious, in a dream for weeks. I guess I had a really high fever. After that, I just felt so weak. I used to be chubby, you know. I lost 40 lbs. I’m still too skinny. But they made me stay inside for weeks after I was better. That’s when I first discovered I liked old vids. I had nothing else to do. They wouldn’t let any other kids near me.”
“So you learned to be on your own. I always wondered how you were so ‘I don’t give a fuck’ about what other kids thought about you.”
“I’m not actually. I just don’t have a choice. My mom was very insistent that I never tell anyone about it when we moved back. Some people think once you are infected, you’ll always be infectious. Don’t worry, it’s bullshit. But people believe a lot of bullshit. Anyway, I wasn’t trying to be standoffish. I just was. I hadn’t talked to anyone in months, wasn’t up on the latest whatever. Maybe if I’d said, hey, I’ve been locked up for 6 months, fill me in, it would have been different. But everyone assumed I just thought I was too cool to like what they liked.”
“Not that you would like it just because they did,” Mik pointed out.
“Yeah, fair enough,” she said. “But all this New K team spirit, it’s mostly a mirage to me. But hey, I don’t really like to dwell on that time. So what’s up with you?”
He told her about the trip to mall with his dad.
“At the end, he got a little teary with me. Like he was hoping we would be some father/son Demand Gen team. I guess I never thought it meant that much to him.”
“Yeah, my mom’s the same way.”
“And then he started in on the whole new century thing. Like the calendar is going to save us.”
“Verdad,” she said. “But I bet your dad doesn’t really understand what New K means by the new century. He probably just takes it at face value, you know, things are going to turn around get better.”
“Delusional,” Mik said.
“Indeed,” Nila said. “But I heard what Rob’s Junior said about it, and it’s not just rah-rah. It’s going to be nasty. They’re going for world domination.”
“My folks think New K already dominates the world. They think New K is the most powerful organization in the world.”
“Maybe,” Nila said. “But it’s a big world and they don’t just want to be the most powerful. They want to be powerful enough to control most of the world, which they’re not. That’s what the new century means to them.”
“I hadn’t thought of it quite that way,” Mik admitted. “Makes me even more glad I’m not going into Demand Gen.”
“Have you decided yet?”
“Yeah, I’m gonna give AI a try. You?”
Nila could see the hesitation on his face, like he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
“Got a few days yet. I want to go, I’ll be honest. You’re just about the only reason I would stay.”
“Thanks, I guess,” Mik said. “I mean, that would be great. But I don’t want you to be unhappy.”
“Well, that makes two of us,’ she said, smiling to reassure him.
“What if you crossed the river? Maybe you could do something with, you know, your friend over there? Maybe I could sneak over there and see you.” 
He’s a sweet kid, she thought. “You know, I hadn’t considered that. I’m going to think that one through. Like I said, still a few days to work things out.”
She downed the rest of her coffee and they got up to go for a walk up toward the park.

* * * * *
She had to admit, she hadn’t really thought about just crossing the river. All of her plans had been to go far away. Hudson’s Bay, maybe. You heard that there were all sorts of new farms and things up there, a new world to build. And no New K. Yet.
She went up on the roof of her building to clear her head. She looked south toward Cambridge and Boston beyond. From here, Cambridge looked like anywhere else around New Kendall. Rivers, marshes, fields, clusters of homes, clusters of ruins, all connected by half-broken roads filled with mostly with bikes and the occasional truck.
Her mind was calm now, She let the waveform wash over her, hearing bits and pieces of so many minds. In the stress of the last weeks, her ability to entangle seemed to have taken a leap — all those minds seemed more vivid, more detailed now. She remembered what Raefe’s felt like and there it was.
“Hey,” she said. “I was hoping we could talk.”
“Sure,” he said. “You feel…complicated. Is everything OK?”
“Yes and no. The List came out. You know about that?”
“Yeah, sure. You’re worried about your choice?”
“They’ve got me boxed in. My folks have made sure I’m fast-tracked for the inner circle. I don’t think I can do that.”
“You’re not alone there. Year by year, they lose more people like you.”
“I kind of had that sense. And I was wondering…”
“Wait! Where are you?”
She let him see through her eyes. She could feel that his mind was also occupied with others, with voices she couldn’t hear.
“I can’t explain, but you’re in danger. Go, now, don’t stop until you get to the place we met. Someone will come for you.”
And he was gone. She couldn’t feel him anymore. For a second, she tried to scan for anyone nearby, but nothing. There was a ladder that went down two floors to another roof, where the air conditioning was. There was a door there that went down a back stairway. She didn’t know what Raefe had felt, but she had an idea that if she stopped, she would never be free again. She ran all the way down, and out, and kept running.
*****
Raefe talked to Tosh about saving Nila. They knew that some of the Norcamb bunch had ways to sneak in to New Kendall. But could they get all the way to the Nila’s hiding place? They agreed Tosh would bike up to the Norcamb settlement and see if they could help. He was back in an hour, smiling.
“They’ll have her back here before dark. ‘Piece of pie’ they said. Cheeky lot!”
“Nothing wrong with that!” Raefe said. “I’m just glad we can get her out.”

            <Notes>Raefe alerts Nila to the danger she’s in. Nila decides now’s the time to get outside NK’s reach. Hudson Bay awaits.

She and Mik talk it through one more time. He’s still ambivalent, afraid of winding up starving to death in some far away place he’s never even seen on the net.

They agree to keep in touch, tangling if they can. They leave heartbroken but maybe it’s for the best?</Notes>

            <Text>TechTown
February 8, 2049
The train glided to a stop in TechTown, with it’s 40-story glass towers towering over  Cambridge. Several heads jerked upright, their Voices telling them through their fashionably nearly invisible ear implants that it was time to wake the frick up and get off the sooty train and head to their jobs. Shiny little office nerds, nervously tapping their eyeglass puters on. Must check those messages, wouldn’t want to have to look at all the grimey losers on the train.
Raefe couldn’t afford such fancy gear. Plain old flesh-colored skingel minibuds would have to do on his codetech salary. Right now, he was near the bottom of the food chain: a CodeEngine jockey who operated the software that MiniWorlds used to churn out application code. If he proved himself, he could move up to design and build the software that ran the CodeEngine clusters. Then from there, he could become a softsystems architect, helping design the complex EvoEco virtual ecosystem that evolved all the codes to work together to get anything done. Then he could think about invisible implants, or actually moving to the top floors of those 40-story towers, with their views of the harbor to the East, and the low hills landward. Right now, he was happy enough to look out of his own apartment at the building next door.
Or I could stop chasing this foolishness because I know it will all be under water someday if the world doesn’t smarten up. Someday in my life, not some far distant future in a scifi vid.
And find Lina. Their online exchanges left him aching for her. Not just for the pleasure of her sex. Somedays not even mostly for that. But for the pleasure of their comfort together. For the deep letting go that his body remembered more than his mind. Now even the sight of her words on the screen triggered those memories, and made him long for more.
That would have to wait. He had reached his workstation. There was already a good number of work orders waiting for for him. The usual crap: build a socket for input A to plug into module B, turn a fixed input into a user-adjustable one, and so on. CodeEngine had already downloaded all the parts he would need, but he needed to do some research to find out the full context the code would be used in before deciding exactly which variants of the parts, and in which order, he should use. 
The morning went by on autopilot. He worked through his usual espresso break and dispatched his to-do list and sent the results off for testing. The part of him that had survived the tidal wave did better in the mornings. As the day wore on, he grew restless with the routine, so he had taken to front-loading his day with work and rewarding himself with an actual lunch break. No more sipping smoothies at his desk while working. MinWorlds didn’’t care, as long as they could keep feeding their sim frameworks to their customers, who turned them into finished sims, games, courses or whatever.
After lunch, he would have the results and could make corrections and do final tuning and optimizing. He looked across the wide expanse of the office where all the CodeEngine jocks sat. Nikko was heads down, the furrowed brow she got when she was deep inside the machine. Herbie was leaning back, arms folded, contemplating the screen — the thoughtful face he used when thinking about non-work items. Roderick was doing that thing with his hands where he would held them high above the keyboard, and hit a key at a time with a motion like he was conducting an orchestra. He always did that when he sent his code off to the test queue. So, at least two for lunch. He sent them a word bubble to meet at 12:10 on the water walk.
Raefe wandered out there, soaking up the early spring rays. He was looking for the Ethiopian food truck — close as he could get to Lina. He got a plate of chicken wat and some bread and walked over to the part of the water walk that jutted further out over the harbor. He grabbed a table big enough for three and waited for Herbie and Rod.
What were they thinking when they built this, he wondered. In 10 or 20 years, this could be underwater. Why didn’t they spend the money to build a solar farm or rebuild the grid or anything that would forestall the rising seas? Instead of a nice lunch place for software builders.
“Hey, you look deep in thought,” Herbie said. “What’s up?””
“Oh, nothing,” he said. “Just thinking how life is short on time and long on bullshit.”
“OK, then,” Herbie said. “Is that from your upcoming book, ‘Raefe Speaks?’ You have been very philosophical lately.”
“I guess so,” Raefe said. “No one told me that building grunt code would not only make me unrich, but deeply wise. They really should include that in the job posting.””
“Oh, I don’t know,” Herbie said. “Seems like so many jobs offer a life of enlightened poverty.”
“What?” Rod said, just sitting down. “Poverty? What do you know about that? You should come with me next time I visit my family in Nigeria.””
“It’s all relative,” Herbie said. “What you’’re used to.”
“Right,” Raefe said. “Herbie, you’re used to whining. Rod,you’’re used to reminding us all that you grew up where oil sludge goes to die.”
“And you,” Rod said. “What are you used to?”
“Eating lunch with you two, so that I can soak up the full range of human experience.”
Talk turned to work — which supervisor was the biggest jerk, which single women were at least semi-hetero, which of them might be desperate enough to consider a fellow CodeEngine jock as a sex partner, and so on. Raefe started to tune out during the sex talk — he had lost interest in pursuing the usual suspects in favor of figuring out how to reunite with Lina. Something Rod said kicked off a series of recollections from other Raefe.
“Hey, not to break up this highly enlightening discussion of relationship building techniques, but I’ve been meaning to ask you Rod, where again are you from in Nigeria?”
“Ikorodu. It’s near Lagos.”
“Right. And why would I have heard of it before I met you?” Raefe asked.
“You probably heard about the whole mess there with development. The government had this grand plan to create a floating city on Lake Lagos that was connected to Ikorodu. With Lagos having over 30 million people, the government wanted to build housing to relieve that congestion and Lagos is not far away.”
“But they messed up?” Herbie asked.
“It was a disaster. Corruption, bad engineering, ethnic conflict — it all came together around this plan.”
“Were you there when it happened?” Raefe asked, now curious.
“Most of it, yeah,” Rod said. “Truth? It’s still going on.””
“Somebody told me about a guy who was trying to stop it — Goodstuff Benjamin. Ever hear about him?” Raefe asked.
Rod laughed. “Goodstuff? Everyone knows about him. Everyone has an opinon, too.”
“No kidding,” Raefe said. “I didn’t know he was such a big deal. What’s your opinion?”
“Complicated,” Rod said. “Goodstuff, he has the right idea. In Nigeria, corruption and screwing up the environment are almost the same thing. In the old days, it was just take the oil and run. Then the big global agripharm companies realized that Nigeria was one of the best places in the world to both get oil and grow crops. So they could integrate the whole chain: take the oil, make fertilizer, genetically modify crops for higher yields. The generals were very happy to help. But Goodstuff’s followers, they were the losers in the process. Their land suddenly had oil wells on it and their water was polluted. Their farms were stolen for a pittance by Monsanto Takeda. The can’t even buy seed anymore without having to buy engineered seed, and that means they have to buy the enzymes to activate it, and they can’t afford that.””
“But?” Raefe said, sensing there was another side.
“Goodstuff is a talker, “ Rod said. “He’s like the preacher on Sunday. He tells you about the promised land, but somehow, you can never quite reach it. And the generals got sick of his preaching, and they chased him back into the forests in the North. Up there, the jihadis are after his ass, too.”
“Good taste in enemies,” Herbie said.
I feel like I have to meet this guy, Raefe thought, but how? How was he going to find a guy who was basically hiding from fanatical warlords in rural Nigeria? Maybe Lina would have some ideas. And even though he knew that Nigeria was quite far from Kenya, it was certainly closer to her than Boston. He was going to have to find a way to cross that ocean.

            <Title>Diver has an idea</Title>
            <Synopsis>Diver comes to grips with what she might do if she took a more active role. She talks to Flier, who agrees it's time. They agree that a way to increase human awareness of how their minds actually work would be helpful. They realize that  Des' ability to &quot;talk&quot; to computers could be useful. She contacts Raefe to broach the idea.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Diver has an idea
Diver yawned, bored. After losing her ambassadorship, she had been rotated through a number of  jobs that failed to hold her interest. This one involved reviewing lists of young people from the various Guardian worlds that the biological resources AI had identified as potential future candidates. She was just supposed to make sure that the AI hadn’t missed something that might cause a problem. The only reason a person did this at all is that 10 years ago or so, the AI had had a bad week and nominated two children who had actually died at birth. No one ever figured out why the AI had done this, nor could the AI itself shed any light. So she had been assigned to make sure such mistakes didn’t happen again. At moments like this, she wondered if one of the old Hankori cabal had rigged the AI to fail just so she could be assigned to this stultifying dead-end job. She didn’t need the waveform to know that most of them wanted nothing to do with her, and she didn’t want to use the waveform to know if their feelings extended to revenge.
Deep down, she thought they were hoping she would quit. She wasn’t having it. She had done nothing wrong and it was a scandal that she was wasting her time on this and neither Hankori or his helpers had been sanctioned for what they had tried to do to the humans. She had decided that being bored was her contribution to a better future, and they could all just stuff it if they didn’t like it.
As she reviewed the kid’s names, she saw that some of them were from Traveller’s Perch and a few were nearby. She became curious — their data looked fine, but what were they like? Why not visit them, she thought. Her enhancements told her that the nearest one was a boy only a short train ride away. He was working at the school farm, apparently learning about plants. She didn’t know him and so wouldn’t recognize him in the waveform. She sent him a message through her enhancements. He responded immediately — apparently he found farming as boring as she found her job and would be happy to to talk.
Flier had left early and was off at the Guardian compound, so no one would even know about her little excursion. There was nothing wrong with it, but somehow she felt like she was breaking some rule or other. She wasn’t sure why, but she actually liked the feeling.
It was a full sun day, but they were all low in the sky. Days like this had their own kind of light, a deeper  blue. Like twilight but warmer. She was happy to take the train. She never liked flying in these skies. The winds were often turbulent and unpredictable. But more, if she soared above a certain height there was an illusion that she had flown above the stars. It was vaguely unsettling. On the other hand, the deep blue was a lovely background through the train window.
After a few stops, she got out and walked toward the school fields. She smiled, remembering coming here with Anti and Mari when they were little. The waveform was filled with the chaos of little children, their sing-songy thoughts bouncing from one idea to the next without any apparent logic. Ah, she realized, it’s the logic of discovery, of seeing certain things for the first time, how things were connected, how they worked. And where you were in all of that.
But how different was she now? Still just a kid, only instead of figuring out why rocks didn’t stay up in the air when you threw them, or why your best friend called you a bad name, you had to figure out big things. But then again, didn’t it feel big when you were still only 5 or 10 years old?
She felt the boy in the waveform, seeing her approaching and wondering if it was her. She let him know she was, and he hopped up and down a few times so she could see him. She had already asked permission from the teachers to have a talk with him. They were happy to help the Guardians. Like most people on Traveller’s Perch, they viewed the Guardians with something bordering on awe. While all of Travellers Perch’s people were highly intelligent, extremely well educated and fairly worldly, for the most part they had little to do with people from other planets, other than perhaps the odd encounter with Adno’s kind on Water Eye. That brought a certain cachet to the Guardians. For the younger ones, it even brought excitement, and this one was no exception.
“You are Three Sweet Chirps?” she asked. He still carried his child name, given when he first sang to describe his characteristic call. Before that, he would have only been known through some form of his parents’ names. Anti had been Fly and Dive, for example, and then Long Keening Whistle, before he chose his name. It was as unpleasant a name as his song, but of course they had never told him that.
“Yes, but not for long,” he said, somewhat embarrassed. “Next year I will choose a real name.”
“Well, that will be a big moment for you. Congratulations, in advance. And after your naming, you want to start on the Guardian training?”
“Yes, it’s all I want to do. Plants are nice, and I like being outdoors a lot. But I want to learn about all the people and places in the Guardians.”
“What is it you want to know about them?”
“How are they different than us? How are they the same?”
“Why does that interest you?”
“I don’t know. I just think it would be very interesting.”
“Have you heard things already that interest you?”
“Sure, who hasn’t? I know who you are, you know. Everyone knows that you became very close to the people on Water Eye. That seems so fun, to be a giant fish and swim with hundreds of others. I want to feel them in the waveform. And there must be others, different ones, right?”
“Oh, yes, there are 20 worlds in the Guardians, each with their own kinds of people. Some even have two or three kinds, although often only one can entangle. I myself have met most of them, but that’s because I used to be an ambassador and that was my job.”
“Didn’t you like it?”
“No, I loved it. Why do you ask?”
“Well, why did you quit being an ambassador?”
She wondered what he’d heard. “That’s a bit of a long story, but let’s just say that being in the Guardians is like being in any other group, like being in school. There are many things to do and they all need doing. So right now I’m working to find young people who will make good Guardians.”
“Do you think I would make a good one?”
“I don’t know yet. Right now, you love the idea of meeting all of these new people. But what do you think you should do when you meet them?”
She could sense that he hadn’t really thought that through. What child did? But his mind was calm, letting his thoughts assemble.
“I want to learn their story. What do young people like me learn about on their world? What can we do to help them?”
“Those are good answers. I worked with one species, the humans. Did you ever learn about them in school?”
“A little,” he said, but she could tell he wasn’t sure.
“Here, I’ll let you experience some of my memories of them,” she said. She let him see images of people she had seen through Raefe’s eyes and of cities and countryside. He was like a sponge, soaking it up.

SPRINKLE IN HERE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SCHOOL FARM, OF THE BOY, THE DAY, ETC.
“Their world is greener than ours!” he said excitedly. “Big trees! But there were so many of them wandering around in their town. And the buildings were so high. Why don’t we have such big towns and buildings?”
“Long ago we did. But eventually there wasn’t enough food and water and people fought over it.”
“Oh, yeah, we learned about that, too. So what happened to all our people?”
“Well, some died in wars. And then we all agreed that we had to change things. Over several centuries we slowly reduced our population to a level that wouldn’t harm the environment.”
“Are we going to help Earth do that?” he asked.
“Well, no. We can’t go changing other peoples’ ways. Maybe it won’t work for them. Maybe they will have a better solution that works for them. We can help them in other ways, by suggesting that they ask certain questions, or look into certain things that aren’t obvious to them.”
“Is that what Guardians do?”
“Sometimes.”
She could feel the excitement draining from him.
“Oh, I thought the Guardians really helped other planets. Like taught them how to live like we do. I think our world is very nice and if people like the humans are decent people, don’t they deserve to live like this, too? I mean, otherwise, what’s the point of the whole thing?”
Indeed, she thought. “I agree with your spirit. It’s just that we have to find a balance. Imagine you had a friend who was hungry and you wanted to give them your favorite food. But maybe you didn’t know that they don’t like it. Or, in the old days, it might make them sick. You could harm them when you meant to help them. You’d want to make sure your friend got the food he needs, not just the food you like.”
“I guess. But what do you actually do in the Guardians, then?”
“It’s different on every world. The main thing is, we make contact with a few people, we determine if most people are going to be able to accept that there are so many other kinds of people and be able to work peacefully with them. We learn about their ways — how they live, work, play, have children and so on.”
“That sounds cool. I would want to do that. What happens after that?”
“If they seem ready, then we try to map out a plan to gradually make them part of our alliance of 20 worlds — to make them the 21st, I guess you’d say. That might take centuries.”
“You must really be into it, to be so patient.”
“I guess I am. I know it’s hard at your age to be patient, but do you still think you are interested?”
“Actually, I do. I know that whatever I do, it will take a long time to accomplish something really worthwhile. I am disappointed that we can’t help them more, but I think I understand. Do you think that will ever change?”
“Maybe a little. Maybe you can be part of that.”
That night, Flier came home from Guardian headquarters. She told him about her little trip.
“I’m trying to decide if he’s right,” she said, “or if I’m just acting like fledgling.”
“You feel it’s an either/or situation?” Flier said, laughing.
“Ok, you’re right,” she said. “I have got myself all wound up about this, like an obsessed 30-year old. I think it’s because I heard from Raefe.”
She told him about their talk and his plans to wander.
“So now he’s convinced that if he can find people who are actually ‘doing’ things, that will be an advance over just spreading empathy.”
“Maybe he’s right,” Flier said. “Maybe that’s how humans work.”
“How’s that?” she asked, not sure what he meant.
“Well, perhaps their sense of the themselves and of the future is more bound up in what it looks, smells and tastes like then how it makes them feel to think about it. To use your analogy with the boy, maybe they like different tasting food than us.”
“Huh, maybe. I hadn’t thought of that. They always seem wildly impractical to me, but also very concrete. I confess, it’s an odd combination.”
“Only to you, not to them. I don’t just say this idley, either. I’ve thought a lot about what you said when we last talked about this. About whether we should intervene more. I’ve been thinking more about what’s holding them back.”
“Oh? And have you reached any conclusions?”
“I have a thought,” he said, “just a thought. I was reviewing what we know about their neural architecture. It’s been there all along, we just ignored it. They’re quite different than any of the  20 Guardian species. All of us have evolved along a certain path, starting often billions of years ago as simple lifeforms. We evolved senses, and brains to analyze the sensory input, and memories to hold it, and consciousness to know what to do with it.”
“The humans have all of that,” she reminded him.
“Yes, but it’s built differently. This is all very obscure stuff — we mostly trust the AIs to figure out a lot of this stuff for us, as far as diagnosing and treating illnesses, optimizing education, and so on, based on our brain architectures. But I did a deep dive into it, and I found something startling.”
“Well, don’t keep me in suspense.”
“The most common way that we know of that living things evolved into highly sophisticated, conscious beings is by first evolving small processing units — brains — that brought together all the elements I mentioned. Than somewhere along the line, there was a mutation and some beings had two of them and they could do a lot more. Than they evolved a way the two brains could communicate more efficiently, literally in fractions of a milliseconds. And then we began to evolve more brains, and more efficient networking.”
“Sure, we have eight brains. The humans never did that?”
“No, nor any other lifeforms on their planet. Humans have one brain with two not quite identical halves. In one way, it’s simple, since their bodies are basically midline symmetrical and each brain half can control one side of the body. Weirdly in their case, the opposite side. And the two halves are connected, so they can do things like walk with both legs in a coordinated way. And then they have all these little centers in each part of the brain that do something very specific. And they’re connected up to memory and decision making centers.”
“Yes, I know all of that. I was their ambassador, you may remember.”
“Sorry, yes, of course. But that’s not what I discovered in my research. The big thing we missed is that this architecture evolved so long ago, basically with the first animals big enough to be visible to the naked eye, that it didn’t evolve to optimize their conscious behavior. It evolved to optimize their instinctive responses to the basics — danger, food, sex. Empathy, too, but mostly in relation to allowing them to bond to other humans in the immediate vicinity to cooperate to defend, get food, and reproduce. In fact, they have trouble extending empathy beyond people they can’t directly sense. They can imagine certain things about those people that help, but they can also have conflicts about it. They hesitate to empathize with people they can’t sense because they instinctively suspect that it puts those in their immediate circle at risk.”
“I’d have to think about that. It does make some sense to me. They are very tactile for sure. But you started by suggesting this might put a new light on helping them. How would that work? You want to change their genetics?”
“Absolutely not! Exactly what we should never do. No, I have a thought that maybe they could use their emerging abilities to entangle to, in effect, entangle with themselves. Perhaps they could gain insight, from the inside, of how their circuitry works. They can’t change it, but they can perhaps be more aware of it. And optimistically, perhaps create new connections that get around this architectural flaw. They could learn how to make their conscious minds and their instinctive minds work together in a different way.”
“And how would we help?”
“Just by educating them about this flaw and suggesting this solution.”
“So just a nudge?”
“Well, maybe. Maybe a guided nudge, whatever that means.”
“How should we do that?”
“I don’t know. I don’t think I should do that — too many eyes on me. But what do you think Raefe would say if you laid some of this out to him?”
“No idea. I don’t think he’d understand it. I don’t think I’m ready to explain it. I’ll need your help there — to really get this deeply so that I can make it comprehensible for him. I don’t know what he would do with this knowledge even if I could make it clear to him.”
“Well, I don’t see how he could do anything harmful.”
“No, I didn’t mean it that way. I don’t know how he would find it useful. Earth is full of theories about how human minds work. For that matter, how other kinds of minds work — whales and trees and monkeys and computers. But nothing very useful ever comes out of it.”
“And yet, they managed to form Citizens of Everywhere by changing the minds of a billion people all over the world without any particular infrastructure to start from. So they know how to change minds, don’t you think?”
“In a way, I suppose you’re right. But they did it without changing how their minds work. Well, that’s not quite true, they started to entangle, and that helped. But they can’t figure out how to get the people who don’t have a strong ability to entangle to change their minds, or at least not enough of them and not enough of a change.”
“Ah, well that’s it, then. That’s what they need to figure out and that’s what we need to help them with. Thank you for taking this seriously. For taking me seriously, I guess.”
 Far Flier sighed, her sadness evident. “It pains me to hear the doubt that has crept into your voice. Nothing that has happened to you in the last years is your fault. It is an indictment of what the Guardians have come to that you feel this way. I don’t know if I’ve ever said this to you, but you were — are — the brightest and most promising new Guardian we have had in centuries. I know I’m not supposed to say things like that, but I’m no longer the head of the council, so I’ll speak my mind, certainly to you.”
Diver wrapped her arms around Flier, just wanting to feel her warmth. She let her emotions settle.
“That is very nice of you to say,” Diver said, “and I guess I needed to hear that. Maybe I wanted too much to be the bright star of the Guardians. Still, I have done what I thought was right and that should be enough. I have to tell myself that too often, but I still think it’s true. You’ve given me a lot to think about. I don’t think the humans can do exactly what you are suggesting, but I think it’s very much in the right direction. I think I need to trust them to make their own sense of it. And that means talking to Raefe again.”
“You know them best,” Flier said. “I’ll leave you to it.”
Diver knew she had to it soon, too, or she would loose the thought. She took a short walk to a little grove near their house that was hidden from the path. The air was clear and cloudless, the stars looked like you could reach out and touch them, hundreds of millions of them. One of them was Sol, the Earth star. Her thoughts went out to find Raefe. By coincidence, it was night there, too.
“Hey, Mars Girl,” he said. “Wasn’t expecting to hear from you for at least another 10 years.”
She could feel he was joking. “Where are you?”
“Still in Cambridge. Probably leave in a few days.”
“No, I mean, are you inside or outside? Can you see the stars?”
“No, I’m in my apartment. Why?”
“Can you go to the roof?”
“Sure, why not?”
A minute later, she felt him again.
“It’s night here, too,” she said. “Are the stars bright?”
“Yes, there’s no moon tonight.”
“Here, too. I know we’re 20 light years apart. But we’re in the same general area of the galaxy, you know. When we look up, we’re seeing something pretty similar.”
“I never realized that,” Raefe said. “I watched an old 20th vid once where this character would say ‘Cosmic!’ about stuff like that — you know, stuff about how we’re all tied together in one big universe.”
“Cosmic! I like that,” she said. “I’ve been thinking more about you humans, and talking to Far Flier. I think maybe there’s a way we can help you more.”
“Far Flier! How is the old bird?”
She laughed. “He still soars, although he mutes his call more often now. He admires you, you know.”
“Me? I guess I’m flattered but puzzled. Why?”
“Neither of us can explain how you’ve managed to do what you’ve done, with Everywhere and the rest. I know you focus on what you haven’t done, but we’re amazed at what you have done. And he admires humans, too, as do I. But what I wanted to tell you is that we’ve come to realize there are things about you that we don’t quite understand.”
“Join the club!” Raefe said. “Now you’re getting what it’s like to be human.”
“More than you realize, I think. You see, we always knew that your biology was different than the other species we’ve met. Well, everyone’s biology is different, but I mean more specifically, your brains work differently.”
She explained what Flier had told her. Raefe listened patiently but intently as she stepped through the whole idea.
“I confess,” she added, “I don’t know what that means for you, or even to you. I don’t think we can do more than this for you. I’m really bending our principles to tell you this much. I don’t mind that — principles are great, but life is better and I want to be on the right side of that. But practically, it means that even though we can entangle and share so much, it’s harder for me to understand how you experience things than with other species I’ve met.”
“I always assumed it was hard for you. I mean, if it’s hard for us, how can it be easy for you?” Raefe said. “But it resonates with me. I think every person sometimes feels like a family gathering where not everyone gets along. There’s that grumpy uncle in the corner, that kid who’s whining for candy next to you, and so on. And you have to be the mom or dad who settles everyone down, cooks the meals, does the wash. And sometimes you just want to yell at all of them to shut up and leave you alone.”
Diver had forgotten how funny humans could be. “And do you?”
“No, you just leave the room, so to speak,” he said. “Because you’ve learned that uncle is going to  grump until he stops and the kid will have his candy and shut up and then you’ll get some peace and quiet.”
“When you feel others in the waveform, do you get all of that from them, too?”
“In a way,” he said. “I feel the mom or dad. And sometimes I feel from them that there is a grumpy uncle in the room, or more often, an angry teenager. I’m just using that as a metaphor. It’s not that cut and dry. Maybe they wish the angry teenager would shut up but that anger also feels good to the mom or dad.”
“Does any of this seem like it would be useful?”
“Not right away. I’m wrestling with what it would mean. On the one hand, you’re right, we’re always a bit of a stranger to ourselves. So how can we move forward if we don’t even know who we are? On the other, we’ve always lived that way. Forever. Some people want to believe that we were once pure and that it was civilization that messed us up. I don’t think I believe that. I look at animals, like a dog or a cat, and I can see conflict in their eyes, too. Is that treat a trick to capture me? Is that hand that reaches out to scratch their fur going to soothe or smack them? So I think we have probably always been ruled by these fears and we really don’t know any other way of being.”
“I’m sorry,” Diver said. “I thought maybe we had an insight that you could use to move forward. Not just you, humans.”
“No, don’t feel bad. I think you may be right. I’m just not sure what to do with it. I want to let it sink in. And maybe share it, with my family at least. They’re all smarter than me. Anyway, I’ll have lots of time to think. It’ll take close to a week to get where I’m going — hours and hours of train rides.”
“Maybe I should teach you to fly, instead,” she said. Humans loved kidding and she had developed a fondness for it herself.
“I’ve always been jealous of that. Humans have dreamed of that forever. And then we invented the airplane and then we had to stop using them because they’re terrible for the climate. We only have electric airplanes now and they can only fly a for a couple of hours, not around the world like they used to. I heard recently about some sort of breakthrough there, but we have no shortage of optimistic tech rumors that never pan out.”
“Well, I look forward to hearing about your travels and your further thoughts on this. May all the winds lift you up!”
We’ve only done the easy things in the Guardians, she thought. Allied with people who are fundamentally like us, even if they look totally different, breathe different air, eat different things. We’ve only connected to people who think like us. Probably we dismissed some candidate species just because we didn’t understand how their minds work and wrongly concluded that they wouldn’t be good members of the Guardians.
She looked up again. Water Eye had slid across the sky while she and Raefe had been entangled, but the rest of the Milky Way stared back, unmoving. What a big universe it is, she thought, and we’ve only just begun to learn about all the odd, wonderful people who live in it.
She walked back inside. Far Flier was grinning.
“What’s so funny?” Diver asked.
“You know your thoughts were leaking out all over the place just now?”
“Sorry, I guess I was a bit overwhelmed,”
“No, it was wonderful, Diver. You give me new reasons to love you all the time.”

            <Text>Becoming Lina
March 5, 2049
Tomorrow will be one week, Lina, thought. I’ll have to give Edna my answer.
For six days, they had walked north and west through the Kenyan brush. The farther they went from the coast, the land became drier, the plants shorter and sparser, and the noise of birds and insects gradually shrunk from a symphony to quiet conversations. It was the same with people — villages gave way to smaller villages, and eventually just to goatherder’s huts. Hours could go by without them seeing any sign of other people.
With no distractions, and surrounded by hundreds of Nowhere people, she had used her newfound empathic abilities to tune into their feelings. At first, it was chaos — the people spoke more than a dozen different languages, and so their thoughts came to her as a kind of linguistic gumbo. As the days wore on, though, she learned to hear past the literal words and by now she was hearing their thoughts in her own Swahili, but subtly altered for each individual. This morning, she could feel a weariness beginning to set in. The land had become drier and flatter. They had to hue to the forests to remain unseen, the trees dividing their ranks into many small braids. The adults grew more wary, constantly scanning for hyenas or other animals that might try and pick off small children if they wandered away.
“Today I am not the only one tired of walking,” Lina said to Edna.
“I’m afraid you are right,” Edna smiled. “But we are close now.”
“To what?”
“Do you see in the distance over there, the woods?” Edna asked. “We will be there soon, and then we will stop.”
“What’s there?”
“New Dabaab. But then, you probably don’t know what old Dabaab was.”
“You mean where the Saudi Air Force bombed the Islamic State in ‘39?”
“Yes, the very same. You were just born then?”
“Yes, but my mother had family that were caught up in that. They were all killed.”
“I’m sorry. Dabaab had a long history before that, and it was even then, more than the last hideout for Islamic State. If you had come here 40 years ago, you would have seen a tent city of more than 300,000 people. Refugees from this war and that. That’s how Islamic State came to be here. By the time they came here in ‘36, they had shrunk a great deal. But they were still armed, and they were able to take over the camps. The UN had run out of money and left the tents to the refugees, who made the best of it. By ‘39, there were still more than 50,000 people here.”
“My relatives were probably some of those refugees. What happened to all of them?”
“They were, in many ways, the first Citizens of Nowhere. The world heard that the bombings killed 11,000 Islamic State fighters, but there were barely 2,000 by then. The rest were just ordinary people, caught in the fighting. Killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Nine thousand people, she thought. And no one really knew. One of the great slaughters of our time, and it never officially happened.
“With every day, I see more of what you mean by Nowhere.”
“It was an awakening for us. Then and there, we had to decide whether to live or become ghosts. We chose to be living ghosts.”
“You were there?” Lina asked, stunned.
“I was a young girl, still not a woman. Yet I became mother to those who had lost theirs. For a week, we lived in the midst of fire and smoke, like violent spirits that herded us into the middle of the camp. When the smoke went away, we thought we would smell the breeze again, the familiar smells of the bush and of the camp. But there was only death around us. When all you can see in every direction are the dead, their sight and smell become one horrible overwhelming sensation that you cannot escape. Even if you close your eyes, you still smell them so strongly it feels like you can see and touch them, all around you. Each time you breathe, you have left the world and are in hell.
“In that time, I understood that I had died and had to will myself and those around me to be reborn. But not just to live as before. That just didn’t seem possible, to endure another hell like that a second time. At first, the imams and what was left of our village leaders tried to gather us for prayers and funerals. But the old rituals brought no comfort, no sense. Certain people wandered off and found each other, somehow, in a quiet bend in the river. They sent word and I came with other young people. We talked for days and in the end, we understood that Nowhere was now our home. Eventually, a few thousand of us joined this new country. We split up into different groups and dispersed to — to Kenya, to Nigeria, other places where we could quietly live unseen. And we come here when we lose that, to regroup and make plans.”
Memories of the Efricar civil war in her other life exploded from their hiding places. She had escaped the worst here in this world, but it was not far away. She let herself feel Edna’s emotions. They were the same rage and deep sadness the rape and killing of her other life brought. But she could feel that Edna stood outside them now, in this place she called Nowhere.
“Please, include me in those plans. I will continue on this path with you.”
“I think you have been on it for a long time, even before you met us. And what will we call you now, Citizen of Nowhere?”
“Lina, call me Lina.”</Text>

            <Text>The caf was buzzing. Today was the day that they called you in and told you the official recommendations of New Kendall Corporation for your future employment — The List. The AI had spoken and today you were to listen to its three magic choices for the rest of your life. Junior had already gotten his. He looked surprised.
“So what did the Wizard of Oz have to say?” Mik asked. “Anything good?”
“I don’t know, I’m still trying to figure that out,” Junior said.
“Well, what were your three choices?” Mik asked. “Don’t be shy.”
“That’s the thing. They didn’t even give me three,” he said. “Just one. And I wasn’t expecting it.”
“And?”
“They want me to study Bahasa.”
“What the fuck is that?”
“It’s what they speak in Indonesia. They said they need more people who speak their language because they want to expand operations there and I’d be a good candidate.”
“Why you?”
Junior looked embarassed. “Well, you know…”
“No!’ Mik exclaimed. “Just because you’re Asian?”
Junior nodded. “And my family came from the Phillipines, not Indonesia. Thirty years ago. I’ve never even been to Asia. I told them that, but you know what they said?”
“Can’t even imagine.”
“’Close enough.’ Can you fucking believe that? They want me to learn the language and then be an interpreter for them.”
“Here?”
“No they want me to learn it here but then move there,” Junior said. “You know what it felt like? Like they were saying ‘Go back to where you came from’ only they didn’t even have that right.”
“That’s messed up,” Mik said. “I’ve never heard of anything like that. Something must be messed up over there. What are you going to do?”
“What can I do?” Junior said. “You heard what Seanito said. Mess with them and you’ll never be right. Always be working with people who don’t want you.”
“Maybe. Who knows if Big Sean really has it right. But I could see it’s a big risk. What do you think your folks will say.”
“No idea,” Junior said. “I’m still trying to figure out how to tell them. They wanted me to go for Monetization, just like your folks. All the parents think Monetization is like winning the lottery. I hope they don’t blame me, like I did something wrong.”
“Or maybe you did something right. Sounds like they think you can handle crises. Like the Alewife bridge.”
“Oh, fuck, I hadn’t thought of that. You’re right! They must have seen that as a little test — we didn’t freak out, we didn’t rat them out to Everywhere, we kept our mouths shut even here in New Kendall. ‘We can trust that kid.’ Now I wish I had said something.”
“Then they’d be recommending you for maintenance. Sewer repair specialist, fourth class. So count your blessings, I guess.”
“It still feels like I’ve landed in the shit anyway.”
They picked over their soy chili in silence. Mik felt bad for Junior, which gave way to feeling anxious about his session with The List adviser, which would be right after lunch. 

*****

Mik sat on a bench in the hallway, along with a handful of other kids. No one talked. They were just trying to keep it together at this point and desparately wanted not to show too much emotion to other kids. The door opened and a girl from his math class walked out. She had a little smile on her face — not too bad, it said. A hand waived him in from inside, a disembodied voice said “Mik.”
He walked in to see a man he had never met sitting behind a desk.
“Ferd Cragen,” the man said, as if that explained everything. “Have a seat.”
Cragen made a show of finding Mik’s record on his puter, as if it were some incredible feat of detective work.
“Ah, here we are. OK, so we have our results. Huh, interesting. It suggests marketing, logistics, or AI interfacer. What do you think of that?”
“Yeah, that’s great,” Mik said, relieved that none of them were his parents’ favorites. “Do I have to tell you now?”
“No, not at all. In fact, these are just suggestions and we need to talk about them. It’s actually an unusual combination — only 3% of students got the same 3 choices. But hey, it’s a new century ahead and we need to walk some new paths, eh? Tell me what you think about them, what interests you about them.”
This felt like a trap, so he paused, trying to keep his face thoughtful. He wouldn’t reveal his cards totally. “Well, I can see why they choose that for me. I’m usually good with numbers and logic, so that explains marketing and logistics. And I’m good at patterns, too, so that must be why they suggested AI interfacer.”
“Patterns, eh?” Cragen said quizically. “I’m not sure I see what you’re getting at.”
“Well, the AI uses algorithms to analyze and decide stuff. Algorithms are based on patterns — if this, then that. My mind kind of works like that, too, at least that’s what some of my teachers have told me. Sometimes AIs don’t see things that don’t belong in the pattern, things a person could see. A person like me. It’s a challenge — it’s basically a “what doesn’t belong” or “what’s wrong with this picture” sort of thing. I enjoy that.”
“OK, that’s a novel way to look at it, but I see where you’re coming from. It’s not just statistics to you, it’s a picture.”
“Sort of.” He could see Cragen was trying to goad him into saying he was smarter than the AI. “I mean the AI works with stats and all sorts of analyses that are way beyond me. I’m just saying when it spits out its result, I tend to see a pattern that it’s created. And you can go from there, to ask if that pattern is useful or matches everyday experience. Like I saw the pattern in the three choices the AI is giving me. Maybe it’s an odd combo — you would know that of course. But to me, I could see the logic, the pattern.”
“Well, apparently the AI could see that in you, too,” Cragen said in an overly cheery voice. “It sounds like you’re most enthusiastic about the AI interface job. Tell me how you see that working in, say, 2110.”
Again with the new century, Mik thought. Give it a rest!
“Gee, I hadn’t thought about that too much,” Mik said. “But I know that some of the interfacers become AI engineers, getting deeper into the code and helping improve it.”
“Yet you’re not rated here for software engineer.”
“True. I know I would have to study more on that. I could learn on the job.”
“Perhaps,” Cragen said. “The trend now, though, is to have the AI write its own code.”
This was news to him. “So what would be the next step up from AI interfacer?” Mik asked. 
“Still evolving. But if I had to guess, it would be human engineering.”
Mik hadn’t heard that phrase before. “Oh, interesting. We didn’t learn about that yet in school, What’s it about?”
“It’s about engineering processes and policies and rules that make it more likely that people will do the right thing without even having to think too hard about it. That’s what the next century is going to be all about. Right now, for example, we’re working with fishing villages in Asia to improve their productivity. In Hum Eng, they’re looking at what incentives are most attractive to the those people: money, goods, security, or something they discover that wasn’t apparent. Or it might be disincentives: fines for not making quotas and so on. And then the AIs can do all the crunching to come up with the amounts of money or quotas or whatever that will be most effective.”
“Fascinating. Sure, I could see myself doing that in a few years.” A few hundred years, he thought. He couldn’t wait for this to be over.
“What attracts you to it?” 
Freakin’ New Kendall, Mik thought. They never just take yes for an answer. It has to be yes for the right reason, meaning their reason. Tread carefully, he thought. “It’s another pattern, isn’t it? Those fishing people, their life has patterns, too. It would be fun to figure out what makes them go.”
 Mik sensed he had found an answer that was neither what Cragen wanted to hear nor one he could really argue against. Cragen seemed stuck on pause for a minute.
“Okay,” Cragen said. “I’ve noted that here. We’ll let the people in AI interface know that. If you decide to go that route, they can mentor you toward that. Do you want to choose now?”
“Could I take some time? Like to talk to my folks, make sure for myself.”
“Absolutely. We’ll need your answer by the end of the month. And of course, we’re always here to help.  I’ve sent my info to your Voice, should you want to talk further. Otherwise, we’re done here.”
And with that, he ushered Mik out, passing the next lamb to slaughter on the way.

            <Title>Diver talks to Anti</Title>
            <Synopsis>She checks her impressions with Anti who confirms them. She adds information about the differences between species.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Only a few days had passed, but Diver hadn’t been able to wait for Adno’s school to tell her what they had found. Maybe it was a one in a thousand shot that she would be able to spot anything useful combing through the archives one record at a time, but it felt better than doing nothing. And more interesting —what a vibrant galaxy they lived in! For everyone of the Guardian worlds, there were a hundred others bustling with complex life forms. She forgot about the search for intelligent life and just enjoyed the many and varied creatures of the Milky Way. 
The records were fascinating but incomplete. Many species had been marked as “Not evolved” without her being able to understand why — worlds where there were species that thrived in the millions and billions, that had clearly some form of intelligence, some form of social organization, and evidence that they had evolved in the last thousands and millions of years. It was a puzzle that she was having trouble deciphering.
But on WaterEye, they had figured much of it out. Later that day, she felt the same surreptitious energy that Adno used, but this time it was Antithikos, the son she had not seen since coming back to Traveller’s Perch. Still, they were often in touch and his energy and warmth were a familiar pleasure to her. They exchanged pleasantries as usual and then she felt a switch in Anti’s waveform.
“I haven’t felt this shape to your waveform before,” she said.
“No, and neither has anyone else,” he replied. “Anyone who searches for my spectrum in the waveform will miss me.”
“You are being extra careful?”
“Indeed,” he said. “Can you feel how I do this? You should, too.”
She didn’t fully understand how he disguised his mental signature, but she tried to imitate it.
“Close,” he said. “Just focus on this…”
She could feel a little corner of his mind — it was different, unusual, but she saw what it was. Adno’s people were so adept at this! But if Anti could learn it, so could she. She tried and there it was, she had it.
“Ok, I think we can be alone now,” he said. “The school has worked very hard these last few days and we’ve discovered a lot. The first thing to understand is that Hankori was up to much more when he was an ambassador, and then head ambassador, then you realized. His disastrous experiments with Earth timelines were only part of it.”
“And that was bad enough!” she said. “What else have you found?”
“I’ll get to that,” Anti said. “But first I think I should tell you what you wanted to know — have we missed intelligent species to ally with because we didn’t understand them? Basically, yes, and many.”
“While I was waiting for your work to be done I read many records myself. I saw so many that said “Not Evolved” but had nothing to document that. And many seemed like they probably had progressed, even from the scant descriptions.”
“Very good. You’ve already discovered part of the problem. You have to go back before anyone alive today was around, perhaps about 10,000 years ago. You must know of the Shadow Nebula civilization?”
“Yes, the Guardian planet that was destroyed by an unexpected nova of the star they orbited. We would be 21 worlds today if not for that.”
“That’s the one. But none of us knew much about the Shadow people. They were a highly social species, one that had evolved over millions of years from a social colony. As they evolved, they transformed from simple individuals in a complex hive to complex individuals in an even more complex hive. They had many characteristics similar to Adno’s people. And here’s the interesting part — when the Guardians recruited them as the 16th species to join the alliance, all of the ambassadors understood that the Shadow people were different than life on the other worlds. In fact, they were excited to discover a new model of advanced intelligence. They thought it might hold a clue to the Guardian’s future.”
“How is it that this is now forgotten?” she asked.
“It’s an interesting tale. The Shadow people were very influential. While we think of them as disappearing 10,000 years ago, they were first recruited about 50,000 years ago. In the 40,000 years that they were part of the Guardians, they did much to advance the search for other intelligent species. They were very clear to the rest of alliance that their kind of intelligence was different — that their brains were different, that the way they communicated with each other was subtly different, and that the benefits and downsides of their evolutionary path were also different. The alliance, as I said, was excited because now we were gaining a more general view of intelligent life in the galaxy. And with the help of the Shadow people, the Guardians developed a very sophisticated rubric for identifying intelligent species that might otherwise escape our attention. It was that rubric that led to Adno’s people being brought into the fold.”
“I was trained as an ambassador, yet I never heard much of them and none of this. How can that be?”
“After the Shadow people were wiped out, their ideas began to fade. Other than Adno’s people, none of the Guardian worlds really understood how they thought, how they experienced life and reality. Our empathic abilities just couldn’t stretch that far. With each new generation, the Guardians reverted a little more to what was familiar to them. As Far Flier told you, we are most comfortable tangling with minds that work in similar ways. So by the time Hankori became an ambassador, interest in novel lifeforms had waned.”
“And he took advantage of that?”
“Yes, but it’s worse. He stumbled on the Shadow rubric, now buried deep in the archives. At first, he was very excited. He was just a cadet. He was on fire to study the rubric, to put it to work. His mentors — all gone now — discouraged him No one really understood what the Shadow rubric meant. But he actually did. He became fascinated with it, studying it secretly. He became an ambassador — not really his kind of thing —just so he could implement it. His early reports are very much in line with the rubric.”
“So what happened?”
“You know he had a son that was killed in an accident, about 700 years ago?”
“Yes, I did. And that changed him?’
“Yes, he couldn’t cope with death. He kind of lost his mind. And he began to see the Shadow story in a new light. After all, for all of their promise, a single stellar moment had destroyed them. This was the beginning of his obsession with immortality. He began to conflate the loss of his son and the extinction of the Shadow people. If only his son had been pure energy, he would still be alive, just like the Shadow people, is how he saw it.”
“So that was the start of his immortality scheme? Seven hundred years ago? My, he was patient.”
“And devious,” Anti said. “Just as strongly as he felt that we needed to chase immortality, he felt that enlarging the Guardians was a waste of time. Since the best prospects for growing the alliance were species that fit these broader notions of intelligence, he saw his opportunity. He wormed his way into greater influence in the ambassador core, and began to slowly bury not only the Shadow rubric, but any ongoing projects that had come from it. Earth was the last one still going. He tried to sabotage it with his timeline shenanigans and then finally with the plot that your and father mother discovered.”
“What a disaster!” she said. “My whole feeling about the Guardians continues to decline. We have kidded ourselves for centuries. We have done much good, but we are blind to our failures and flaws.”
“Yes, we have to face that. But maybe it is not so gloomy as you say. After all, the Shadow rubric is now going to see the light of day again.”
“That is true. You and Adno have done great work.”
“But so much more to do. Hankori had help, let us not forget.”
“Who knew besides him?”
“I doubt anyone knew about the rubric. He is a deeply disturbed fellow and he hides himself even from his colleagues. So I doubt that Green and the others who helped him in his foolish plot on Earth knew the root of it all. Perhaps it wouldn’t have even made a difference. Adno is keen to reverse this tide and let the waters once again carry truth, but I think she is being very optimistic, as always.”
“I agree. Green and the others have sidelined Hankori, but not his ideas. I suppose they realized he is insane. But they love the immortality idea and they do what they can without attracting too much attention. For all practical purposes, that’s all the Guardians are actually doing now, as little as that is. We must think hard on our course of action.”
“Will you talk about this with father mother?”
“Of course. Of him I have no doubts. I only shield her for her safety. She sacrificed much to defeat Hankori and to keep us safe. You must always remember that.”
“I will do my best,” Anti said. “It’s hard to be apart. You both are like ghosts to me after three decades.”
“I feel your sadness, I really do. I try not to let myself feel the same — it only makes me angry and rash. Now I must be the careful hunter, watching her prey, waiting for the right moment.”
“You do not have to be the lone hunter. You have many here who will help.”
“Thank you for reminding me,” Diver said. “I do sometimes forget. I will speak with Flier. Marillon also knows of this?”
“Of course — there is nothing I know that my sister doesn’t. Mari will fly with you when the time comes.”
They said their farewells. She was alive with the churning of her thoughts. So much to tell Flier. So much to do.</Text>

            <Text>Picking up the pieces
Cambridge
January 18, 2099
Raefe Epstein Miller was exhausted and it was only dawn. It wasn’t just that at 71 he really needed more than three hours sleep. He had lived through many hurricanes, but when they became these storm-surge, tidal-waved beasts that filled the nights with screams of panicked, drowning people, it was just too much of a reminder of that first fatal flood 51 years ago. He was only a mile or two from their old drowned TinyStack, and well, it was all just a bit overwhelming. Add to that, he was crashing in Tosh Winchester’s apartment, the son of one of the few people who had been with him and Lina when they had all died on Truro Island in their other life. Well, Tosh’s dad Alton had died back there, not much older than Tosh was now. The Alton in this world had been another Alton on another timeline, one of a nearly infinite number of them. This Alton knew nothing of that, nor would Raefe ever tell him.
Raefe and Lina were different. The Guardians had merged them with their alternate selves from that other timeline, but no one except their children knew that. Being here was like sitting in a thick tree branch above the ground, looking down at the thick trunk from which the branch had come, the trunk he had climbed to get here. He felt practically entangled with the very rock and water around him, memories of both timelines piling up. He needed air.
The sky was light slate with hints of blue. Even the sun seemed grayish in the aftermath of the storm. The air still tangy with ozone, wind and lightning having torn the very molecules apart. Even here in the relative safety of Porter Square, you got a sense that something bad had happened — haphazard branches littering the nearly empty streets, large branches splitting big old trees, restless trash containers rolling down the largely deserted streets. He opened his mind a bit  to the waveform, and felt strong notes of sadness, fear and resignation. It was what the waveform always felt like when people had lost loved ones, their homes, and their sense of a place where they belonged. He shut it down before he connected directly with individual people. He had nothing but emptiness to offer them just now.
In some ways, it had been just like the other storms that happened several times a year now. But it had also been bad luck, coming at the high tide, with the wind just so, driving hard up the rivers and streams, pushing them overland even as the storm filled them with rain. He knew from the waveform that more than a few people had died. Today would be a time for counting and figuring and maybe, if they had time, for easing the pain. By tomorrow, they would need to be in motion, rebuilding, reorganizing, rethinking their next steps.
“How are we going to help them?” It was Tosh, standing behind him. He hadn’t even noticed, he had been so lost in thought.
“Yes, how? That’s always the question,” he replied, wishing he something less Buddha-like to say. “Have you felt the waveform?”
“Some. It hurts!” Tosh said. “Like dipping your toe into scalding water. I had to back off. I was able to find the net, though, too. The Mystic and the Alewife were really pounded. There’s a lot of damage — everything between the river and Mass. Ave was under and in the east, all the way to Prospect and east to McGrath. First time Inman Square was under water.”
“There’s more than damage. I can feel it.”
“Yes, me, too,” Tosh said. “Grief and anger. People died, many more hurt.”
Raefe sighed and allowed himself to feel the waveform more. He let it wash over him, and soon enough, he felt those who grieved. He found some who were also empaths. He let Tosh feel them, too. The kid would have to learn how to do this on his own. Raefe didn’t know how much more of this he had left in him. But Tosh was willing, he was absorbing the blows, taking it on. 
“You were right, Raefe,” he said after a few minutes. “There’s a lot of pain. Too much for anyone out there to have a clear picture. We’re going to have to get everyone together and figure what we can figure.”
“Everyone” was the local committee of Everywhere, the loose amalgamation of people that had come out of the Citizens of Nowhere, and Alton’s New Voodo Army and a hundred other fugee groups back in 2081. It was the only thing even close to a functioning government here anymore. Massachusetts still existed, but it was fading fast and not up to the challenge. Everywhere couldn’t be everything to everybody, but they did what they could, figuring stuff out as they went along. People complained, but what was the alternative?
Porter Square was starting to fill up. The market was coming together in the old parking lot. Before the T had been drowned, there was a station there and stores, now just empty hulks. Workers came to the lot for the daily shape up. Some times  a truck would come to put together crews for the big New Boston renewal project high up in the Dorchester hills, on the other side of Boston. That was good work if you were homeless or had lost most of your things — they let you bivouac in their tent city, you got three squares and the pay was good. Others were content to take smaller, local jobs. Maybe they had people near Porter they didn’t want to leave.
Raefe followed Tosh to the Everywhere office in an old college building. A couple of dozen people were already there, sitting around talking, trying to make sense of the last evening’s events. Tosh clapped his hands a couple of times.
“Morning everyone. We’ve got a lot to do today. First, is everyone OK?”
“Ronnie’s stuck in Inman,” a young woman said. “His block is drowned and he’s got to help his parents.”
“Yeah, same for the whole crew from near Central,” a young man said.
“OK, well we’ll check with them later,” Tosh said. “Anyone had a good link to the net?”
“Yeah, I have,” a middle-aged woman said. “And it’s not good news. The storm’s done with, but turns out it was only half the problem. Another piece fell off Antarctica about a day and a half ago. A really big one. By the time the rivers decide they want to go full on to the sea, the extra ocean will be pushing it back.”
“Sura, any word on where it will settle out?” an older man asked her.
“Can’t know for sure, of course,” she said. “But the best guess is right about where it is.”
“And what do you think this will mean for the rivers, Charney?” Tosh asked the older man. “What about the Alewife?”
“Deeper and wider, but about the same track I’d guess,” Charney answered. “So this is the new normal, what we have now.”
“Can we get a hold of Ronnie?” Tosh asked. “It would be good to know if there’s anything we should salvage from Inman.”
“I doubt it,” the young woman who had reported him absent said. “But he’s an empath — maybe you can tangle with him?”
“Yeah, later, thanks,” Tosh said. “But before I get us stuck in all these weeds, is there anything really big we need to address right away?”
“You bet,” a man on the edge of the circle said. Raefe recognized him — Pedro, a fugee from the old Cambridgeport who lived open up near the Alewife flood plain. “At least six people were shot last night by the New Kendall secs. Four died, the others got away lucky.”
Raefe felt the combined “what the fuck?” and “fuck those motherfuckers!” surge from the room. Mother Nature might kill them all, but it couldn’t fire a gun.
“Do you know what happened?” Tosh asked.
“Hell yeah. I was there,” he replied. “The river started pushing outward and it was coming down Mass Ave toward our camp. We’ve been living in the flats between the old bus yard and the Catholics up on Matignon Hill. It’s never flooded there before. We tried going up Matignon, but there’s that moat around the Church and the waters were rising. We didn’t know where to go. Some people wanted to go east back toward Tufts, but sometimes when the river floods it cuts that way off. Some people wanted for us to go over to New Kendall — it’s usually dryer on that side. But they had the checkpoint on Broadway all beefed up. We had some empaths, too, and they said the checkpoint crew didn’t feel like they were there to talk. Scared. We had an old flat bed truck up by the camp that people sleep on. Someone got the bright idea of pushing down the hill and using it to cross the drowned bridge at Mass Ave. The water was still pretty shallow there, not past the truck tires. The empaths didn’t feel much coming from that direction. But half way across, we realized it was armed too. We were stuck. They opened fire. We couldn’t even hear it, really, the river was roaring pretty good by then. All of sudden there were people dropping with holes in them. The rest of us barely got away with our lives, caught between gunfire and the fast water. So yeah, I was there. I saw those sons of bitches open fire.”
Raefe could feel the vibe in the room turn ugly. He knew what the toxic mix of emotions called revenge felt like and it was starting to rise from the group like steam from the sidewalk after a summer rain. Those idiots in New Kendall would get them all killed. But not today, he thought.
“Pedro, do you know the people who were killed?” he said. “We need to find out if they had people who need help. Same with the injured.”
Pedro nodded.
“Good, after you can tell Tosh. How many of you live up there open?”
“Maybe 300, 400. More now — the water took some homes.”
“My thought is our first priority is to get all of you out of the open, or at least farther back from the water. If big ice went in the ocean down below, the river won’t go back. And the next storm, it will flood higher. We need a plan, but first we can resettle people on higher ground.”
“Yeah, sounds good, but what about them bastards that shot at us? We can’t let that pass,” Pedro said.
“No, we can’t,” Raefe said. “But what do we want to do?”
“You know what we should do,” Pedro said.
“I know what you think we should do,” Raefe said. “And I understand it. Even the score, right?”
“You bet. Someone has to pay the price.”
“You say that like a man’s life has a price,” Tosh said. “And that the payment will buy us something.”
“It’ll buy us them thinking twice next time.”
“Let me ask you something, Pedro,” Raefe said. “Last year, when that New Kendall sec shot those kids who snuck over and stole some wood to build a shelter, what happened to that sec?”
“I heard he got in a fight up there and was killed,” Pedro said.
“We both know the fight was an ambush and someone from here killed him,” Tosh said.
“Ok, yeah,” Pedro said.
“And a year later, New Kendall has no problem firing on people who were already facing death,” Raefe said. “So message received, message…what? What message you want to send this time? Four deaths?” He already knew that was Pedro thought and he wasn’t the only one in the room. But this wasn’t the first time they had confronted this problem. Most people didn’t want to go that route.
“Raefe’s right, Pedro,” Sura said. “Sure, someone can figure out how to kill four New Kendall secs. And next time, they’ll fire sooner and longer. Or maybe just send drones over to do it. We need a better way.”
“Well, you better come up to the camp then, because I’m pretty sure the people up there think that’s the best way,” Pedro said. “And I ain’t gonna tell ‘em different.”
Tosh looked at Raefe, uncertain about what to do. 
“You’ll take me there?” Raefe asked Pedro.
“Suppose so,” Pedro said. 
Raefe could feel that’s not what Pedro had wanted, to bring a peacemaker to a war party. With any luck, there would be some empaths up there. Not that it wouldn’t be perfectly obvious what everyone was thinking. Raefe had navigated hundreds of these situations over the years and they were never very different. But it was easier if people could see he was on their side even if against their plans. It helped get past the loudest ones who always wanted to make him an outsider who shouldn’t be trusted. But he was tired and hoping that it wouldn’t take all he had to help them find a better path.
“Thanks, we’ll go soon. I don’t want to take a chance something kicks off while we’re sitting here talking. But I do want to say that we are not without power against them,” Raefe said. “New Kendall likes to think they’re not affected by all of this, up there on Arlington Heights. They like to pretend that as long as the net works, they have all they need. But they need food, they need supplies just like the rest of us. They need young people to come work for them. And sometimes those supplies and people come from places like Everywhere. At the least, we need to remind them of that.”
“True,” Tosh said. “But I think we need to be stronger than that. They pretend that there’s justice inside New Kendall, not just bosses telling workers whatever they want. So either those soldiers broke their rules, or the soldiers were following orders from the higher ups. One way or another, some one needs to be held accountable.”
“And then there’s the dead,” Sura said. “Corpos have money, they should pay reparations for the families.”
Heads nodded.
“Agreed,” Raefe said. “Let me go with Pedro now. Tosh, Sura, will you come with me to New Kendall later? We need to confront them and get answers.”
“They never talk to us,” Tosh said.
“But some of them can tangle,” Raefe smiled. “Let’s just say I have contacts there.”
*****
They gave Pedro a bike and the four of them rode north on Mass Ave. Past Rindge had been a bit of a no-man’s land for several years. The first tornado to hit Cambridge in memory had flattened one side almost 10 years ago. Two year’s later, days of severe lightning had finally blown up transformers in the old bus yard, starting a fire that burned everything for blocks. Worse, it spewed chemicals from the equipment and burned buses all around and some of it had seeped into the water. The dying city and state government had given up on North Cambridge after that. The city was being squeezed on all sides, shrinking in toward the higher ground in the middle, and they focused their efforts on hardening that against the constant storms. It might be above the water line, but the hurricanes, the lightning and the increasing heat waves were a challenge. 
Cambridge was also in danger of being islanded. They had all heard that today, for example, the only way out was Huron Avenue to the west. Boston lay like a drunken older brother to the south, across a newly large and fast moving Charles. The bridges had held up, but the roads to and from them were unpassable. With governments being only nominal institutions now, there was no one to rebuild them. 
Tosh had felt him ruminating about this as they rode. 
“Everywhere has faced this before, Raefe,” he spoke to his mind, “in many places. You know it will just take time.”
“I remember all the times I have said that to people,” Raefe let him know, “and they couldn’t get past seeing the familiar places of their life drowned and useless and wondering when it would stop getting worse. Of course, I knew how they felt, but I am reminded again how it really feels. I know no one wants to hear about life before the floods, including me. But I remember riding my bike on this street when it was jammed with cars and scooters and bikes and life.”
Tosh nodded and left Raefe to mourn alone.
They had passed Rindge Avenue and any pretense of a functional city. They got off their bikes to walk. It was easier to navigate the deep potholes and the clusters of tents and makeshift shacks that marked what had been a busy thoroughfare. These were the losers in the climate lottery, the people that hadn’t even been able to secure an abandoned house or a spot in a park. These were Pedro’s people.
As they walked among the crowd, Pedro began to pick up a following. People were still buzzing about the prior day, their emotions fueling a chaotic waveform. Raefe realized they had expected Everywhere to back them, to send people to join an invasion force. Sura and Tosh were noticing the same thing — the next few hours wouldn’t be easy.
Pedro’s daughter, Ines, met them and took them to the edge of the old bus yard. She had her father’s brown skin and wide brown eyes but a blonde braid that descended to her waist. She was probably only 30, but she was weathered enough that you’d sooner guess 40. There were a bunch of people strewn around the yard, but they walked over to a small group of a dozen or so.
“Guys, these are the people from Everywhere,” she said. “They came to talk about the attack. Introduce yourselves.”
“Jean-Baptiste,” a dark-skinned black man said. “Walden Street crew. Alice over there, and little Samuel, the same,” he said, pointing to an Arabic looking woman in a headscarf and black teenager. The Walden street crew were mostly former residents of a big housing complex that had become islanded. They usually lived up on Danehy Hill in an old park, but they came down here during storm surges because the Hill got islanded, too.
“Manny,” a pasty young white man said. “SoNos.” Southern Northerners was what the first wave of south Florida fugees had come to be called. Legend had it that the first ones that asked if there were any places they could stay were told “So, no” by some post-hipster wise guy.  Whatever, the phrase had stuck. He waved at several others, presumably all SoNos. They had streamed north after the first big sea rises, millions of them. Here in Cambridge, they had arrived long after there was any housing available or money for new construction and had become nomads, drifting from abandoned area to another, living open or in ruined buildings.
“And that’s Alejandro, Rianna, Shaylene and Warren,” Ines said. “They were chosen by the rest of the people up here, the ones who don’t belong to a steady crew. And me and pops will speak for the Norcambs, the long-timers up here.”
Tosh introduced Raefe and Sura and then asked, “So what do you guys need?”
Everything it turned out. They talked for a half hour about food, water, and shelter. None would be easy, but Everywhere would do what they could.
“And what about justice?” Ines asked. “You gonna get us that, too?”
Like justice could be bought or sold, thought Raefe.
“Don’t give me that ‘justice isn’t a commodity’ bullshit,” Ines said, looking right at him.
“Ah, you are skilled,” he said smiling ruefully. He would have to be more alert. “So you know I don’t think it is bullshit. But we’re not here to discuss philosophy, are we? What do you think is justice for your dead friends?”
She was sizing him up, thinking about it. “If I say ‘an eye for an eye,’ what will you say?”
“Same as I’ve always said,” he replied. “The point of struggle is not to defeat your enemy. It’s to make a better world. That’s two things New Kendall doesn’t get. How about you?”
“I say it would be a better world without New Kendall,” she said, and he could feel the others agreed.
“Truth,” he said. “And without the last 100 years of history, too. But here we are, and how do we get there? You want to kill four people from New Kendall and call it even, eh?”
“It’s a start,” Pedro said.
“Of what?” Sura said. “Of more death? Seems like the water is taking there of that, then the heat, then the famine. Don’t need no help from us.”
“Ok, truth,” Ines said. “But we need to teach them a lesson.”
“New Kendall is not a person,” Raefe said. “It can’t learn anything. So the question is, who are we trying to teach? Ken Robertson Jr.? He will never change, any more than his daddy did. The old man was willing to nuke the world to save the asses of the richest thousand people in the world. You think his kid is any better? No, I know you don’t. The people we should be teaching are the kids and the grunts that live over there. They’re the fuel that feeds New Kendall. Kill four of them, and the rest will hate you. For a long time. Find a better way and they will think twice about firing again, or maybe not at all.”
He could feel that they knew that. Of course they knew it, because they had seen it over and over again. He felt a bit of steam go out and it made him sad.
“Look, we need all the passion we can get,” he said. “I’m not saying you’re wrong to want something to come out of this. Shit, we’re not powerless. New Kendall is basically surrounded by us, even if they won’t admit it. And we have many needs. Maybe we can get them to rebuild the bus yard, or at least give us the supplies. Then you would all have a home.”
“So our lives are worth a quarter of a bus yard each?” Pedro said angrily.
“No,” Raefe said. “Your lives are worth 100 bus yards, but just one might save you. And we need more. We need them to agree to try their own people and punish them. And I don’t mean the Secs they ordered to pull the trigger. I mean the people who gave the orders. Done, no more orders from them or like that. And more than that, they need to come down off that hill, so to speak. Their day will come, when they can’t get food, when the power no longer works. We need an agreement — life for life. We never refuse each other when lives are at stake. What happened last night can never happen again.”
Ines spat on the ground. “I can’t fucking believe this. We’re going to offer to help them?”
“Are you saying that if the tables were turned last night, you would have shot them?” Raefe asked, keeping his voice low and quizzical, not hard or challenging. He let her feel the depth of his question, to see herself behind that barricade, looking down the barrel, deciding whether to pull the trigger on a drowning person. She stared at him.
“Yeah, no,” she said. She turned to Pedro. “He’s right, Dad, we’re angry, we’re fucking furious, but we’re not killers. Even if we killed to survive, we’re not going to kill someone just so they don’t.”
“You’re all OK with that?” Pedro turned to the others. Raefe could feel some were, some were confused, some wanted to disagree but couldn’t quite figure out why. Heads nodded, no one argued. Pedro looked at Raefe. “I guess you won.”
It never did any good to remind them that they would all win. He had learned the hard way that submission was a ritual, a way to avoid further conflict. It was up to the victor not to take the spoils.
“Come with us,” Raefe said. “I’ll arrange a meeting with New Kendall. I want one of you to come. Nothing happens without you.”

            <Title>Nila and Mik get closer</Title>
            <Text>Nila seemed to have quite a supply of meeting places that she thought were safe from prying eyes. Between classes she had told Mik to meet her this evening in an abandoned building near the Alewife. You had to walk past the building, turn down an alley that was nearly hidden by a big tree and then enter a rusted old door near the back. He had brought a flashlight like she said, finding his way down some sketchy stairs to a basement.
“I’m over here,” she said from a dark corner. She had a small battery-powered light she turned on. She must come here often, he thought. There was an old sofa on a rug in the corner. “The stairs in the main entrance are collapsed, so Sec didn’t think anyone could come down here. They don’t have any surveillance below the first floor.”
She hugged him a little tighter than usual.
“You okay?” he asked.
“Yeah, yeah. But there’s a lot to tell you.”
She told him about her trip to Chiang Mei.
“Did you see any elephants?”
“Just a shrine to them. They’re gone now, extinct.”
“No!” he protested. “Mr. Alvarez said New K had revived them.”
“He lied.”
“Sons of bitches. I always wanted to see one, in person.”
“Well, I did, but it was a dead one. They must have been magnificent. Huge. Enormous feet. And of course, that funny trunk. But I found out some bad shit.”
“Worse than no more elephants?”
“Okay, maybe not. But it turns out my mom is not just some Sec grunt. Robertson was there, and he knew her by name, like they were old friends. She introduced me to him And she gave some kind of talk to all the New K honchos.”
“No shit! About what?”
“Uh, it’s hard to explain. I couldn’t really hear all of it. Seems like they’re stepping up their snooping on tanglers.”
“Huh. I guess I’m not surprised. Why do you think they’re doing that now? We’ve been at odds with Everywhere for decades. And what was Robertson like?”
“Creepy. And I don’t know why now. I could guess. But I was scared, Mik. What if they find out about me?”
“Yeah, I hear you. Won’t your mom protect you?”
“I don’t know. And if she did, I’m afraid it would have a price. Like becoming a New K tool. I feel trapped.”
He could feel her fear, her need for reassurance. Without thinking, he put his arms around her, drawing her to his chest. She folded herself into him. He could feel her warmth, feel her relax just a bit as he cradled the back of her head with his hand. They stood there for a second, still, just feeling each other’s breathing. She looked up at him, her expression hard to read. He felt a rush of feelings.
He touched his lips with his index finger. She nodded and did the same. He pulled her head gently toward him and kissed her. It became a long kiss, passed back and forth, a wordless, rising conversation. A minute ago, she had seemed a mass of neediness. Now her needs seemed more focused.
She took his hand and led him to the couch. He realized that he had been anxious about just such a moment. She was older, probably had been with more people than he had, was more skilled. As exciting as that was, it was also a bit scary. But they undressed each other with about the same mix of fumbling and calm and he felt more able to forget his fears and focus on her now. 
She wrapped them both in the blanket that had been covering the back of the couch. She seemed to sense his anxieties and climbed on top of him. She was light and strong and felt entirely alive to his touch. He closed his eyes and let his hands explore her, finding the places that pleased her. She leaned forward, kissing him, letting her breasts graze his chest. After a bit, she reached down between her legs and took him inside her, her heat and wetness grasping him, pulling him in. A little voice in his head worried that she could read his thoughts. 
A somewhat louder voice suggested good, since she could feel his thoughts, for chrissakes, inside her, so stop worrying. And then he felt her fingers digging into his shoulder slightly, as if to say, hey, I’m here, and he realized that voice had been her, inside his head. He looked up, opening his eyes. In the half-dark, her eyes were closed, but there was a wild smile on her face and a feeling of joy washed him over him. 
And then her hips seemed to be telling him something. He found her rhythm and soon all he could think of was their motion. And then he couldn’t think at all, as they spiraled inwards together to climax.
She rolled off him, squeezing  him toward the back of the couch. He lay on his side to accommodate her. She played with his hair a bit and then popped up and started getting dressed. So he did, too. Finally, she broke the silence.
“That was nice. I was wondering if we’d ever get to that.”
He wondered if she had asked him to this place just to “get to that.”
She smiled. “No silly, I didn’t ask you here just to fuck you. Don’t underestimate yourself — you are really a very reassuring and compassionate person. A half hour ago I was a quivering wreck. Now I’m just quivering, thanks to you.”
“Happy to help,” he said, not knowing how to respond. He had no idea that he could be reassuring to anyone.
“Don’t worry,” she said, “I won’t hold you to it, if that’s what’s bothering you.”
“No, I wasn’t worried. Or bothered, I don’t think. I like you, you must know that. And I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that I, too, had been wondering if we were ever going to take the next step.”
“Easy, boy. One day at a time.”
He blushed. “I didn’t mean it that way. Don’t worry, I’m not going to ask you to marry me.”
She laughed. “Good, because right now I’m not looking to say ‘no’ to you. Let’s leave it at ‘yes, that was fun and nice and we found something together.’ Because I don’t know what tomorrow will bring and neither do you,”
And that was the problem, he realized. He hated not knowing what tomorrow would bring. It usually brought shit — more crap at school and home, more floods, more worries about what job he’d be stuck with. But he needed to know.
“When we were…were you inside my head?”
“Was I?” she asked. “I’m sorry, I guess I got carried away, you know…I shouldn’t have done that.”
“No, it was OK. Sex is weird sometimes — you feel these overwhelming things but you have no idea if the other person is feeling the same thing. And there you were. It was…reassuring, I guess.”
“Happy to help,” she said. “I guess that’s as much reassurance as I can give right now. I can’t see the future anymore than you. And yeah, it bothers me, too. Maybe I’ve learned to live with that more than you.”
Ah, he realized. All that enactor stuff, her rebel image, that was her learning to live with uncertainty. Something to be said for that.
“I think I hear your thoughts a bit now,” he said. “I seem to sense things about you. I don’t think it’s because I’m a good listener or because you’re telling me them.”
“Cool,” she said. “I think it’s because I trust you. I let you sense them without realizing it.”
“Maybe you should be careful,” he said. “Given the new circumstances.”
“Oh, don’t worry, I don’t trust that many people,” she said.

*****

Shit, what have I done, she thought, walking back from her little hidey hole. He’s a good kid, I like him, and it was a fun, sweet romp. A bit more actually — they had connected there for a while. But shit is already too complicated. Is he going to want to come with me when I go? Do I want him to?
Her mind buzzed: And what if he doesn’t, and my feelings for him get more intense? I’ll hate him for making me stay. I have to avoid these moments of opening myself up, she thought, it will only put me in danger. No, that’s not right, either, she argued with herself. What’s the point of having empathic skills if I can’t be an empath, either to myself or him? 
Maybe she’d try to find REM and ask him how he dealt with these moments. Or would he just think she’s a silly teenage girl? He’s old enough to be my grandfather, for fuck’s sake, she thought.
Her face was still flushed from sex, and the night air felt cool against it. It was too much to figure out now and she just let the heat and the coolness mix, feeling like somehow it was a metaphor for something. The answer would come, in time.</Text>
            <Notes>Nila is very excited about meeting Raefe. She tells Mik about it. He feels her mind more than usual. He wonders if he is becoming an empath.

She feels him feeling her and things start to get physical. They get swept up in it and wind up having sex. She is nonchalant about that, he is not. The experience was far more intimate and consuming than his prior ones. He feels closer to her but resisting the notion of love. Not sure why.

She senses this, but doesn’t say anything. She too is ambivalent, since she knows he may not come with her and is not sure she wants to get more involved.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Hanakori and Anatope conspire</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 13
Anatope and Hanakori discuss their progress and strategy. Hanakori begins by telling Anatope how important it is to manage their follow conspirators.  
Anatope, you and I understand our true nature and that of species in general. As we draw closer to success, we will need to be ever more vigilant to manage our brothers. The quest that has taken us this close to success on E12 and our vision to establish a higher order among all species will be challenged by our own limitations. This is what has held back the Ranoldi evolution and that of others—this fear of achieving true control of our universe. Through e12 we will finally rid ourselves of doubts that we have artfully disguised as some type of altruistic vision among all species. 
“So what are you suggesting Hanakori? I share your concern but feel that we must count on our fellow conspirators if we are to succeed. Look at the technical progress that Putnomo has made.”  
And that’s exactly the paradox Anatope. The closer we get to our ultimate vision—to this higher order and new relationships, the more even our high capacity brothers might start to waiver. Petty jealousies like I have detected recently can lead to our undoing.
By the way, I just received an urgent encrypted message from Levilon saying that he wants to share something. This is what worries me. We need our fellow brothers but can we really count on them to make the right decisions and to stay strong? Yes we recruited them because they stood our as un-poisoned by the ridiculous Ranoldi credo. And yes, each brings a clear capacity. BUT……I still worry.
Anyway, I will follow up with Levilon. I assume that his little committee has come up with something. I’ll let you know.
In the meantime I want you to spend even more time with Putnomo. Is it really possible that we are within let’s say 20 Ronaldi years of success? Think about it Anatope. No more fear of an uncertain future. Our ability to provide order and meaning to the universe; to save other species from having to navigate the great unknown. You and I——and others of course once things settle—will be able to make decisions for the common good. For the good of the universe!  It’s truly a remarkable point in time.

            <Synopsis>Aleron contacts Raefe in his coma. The injury has sparked a leap forward in his abilities, but he is desperate to save Lina. She tells him about Alton and he tries to find him, but loses consciousness before he does.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Aleron felt a jolt in her mind. She knew at once that it was Raefe. She had told the minder program on the wormhole interface network to alert her to any strong signals coming from him. She had talked with him only two of his days ago — what trouble had he gotten himself into already? People really were a difficult bunch. She would have to forego her swim for now and return to her room. If Raefe was having trouble, she didn’t want anyone to know until she understood what was happening. Best not to go to her station in the Guardian center. Anatope was always too curious about her progress.
Once in her room, she wasted no time with her usual pre-entanglement meditations.
“Raefe, are you alright?”
“I don’t think so,” his thoughts were oddly narrowed. “Lina and I have been taken hostage by some guys — it’s a long story.”
“I see your memories. How awful. Things are worse than I had hoped.”
“Can you get me out of here?” he pleaded.
Had he figured out that he had been taken ‘out of here’ before? No, he couldn’t have figured out that he had been timeline-shifted. He was just asking for help.
“Sadly, no. Remember, I can only exchange thoughts with you.”
“Can you exchange thoughts with Lina, too?  I was able to do that thing you showed me, you know, like two schools of fish. Tangling. I can tell she’s in trouble, and I’m worried about her.”
“You were able to entangle with her?” She was stunned. She had never found any People who could spontaneously create a connection with someone without the gift. She had been right! He was remarkable. “Let me see if I can reach her, too.”
She felt the remnants of the threads he had made with Lina and followed them. They weren’t deep or wide, but it was enough. Slowly, she wove herself into Lina’s mind. He was right, she had been brutalized. It was not the first time for her, to suffer so at the hands of other People. Lina was building a wall to hide behind. Aleron could not stop her, but maybe she could influence her not to build the wall too high or too deep. Guardians were not supposed to do this kind of meddling, but she knew that Raefe would never care about the Guardians if they couldn’t even help Lina.
Aleron let Lina see Raefe’s anguish about her. Lina couldn’t understand what was happening, but it diverted her from her deepening withdrawal. Aleron felt a spark of hope in her — Raefe was alive and somehow he was trying to help her. Aleron let her complete the thought for herself: I have to pull myself together and find a way to help him.
“Lina will be OK. She will need your help to recover, but she wants it.”
“But how can I help her? I can’t even move. I don’t know if I’ll ever move again, or even survive.”
She probed further, tracing the damage. She fed the data into the biological analysis programs the Guardians maintained about the People.
“You are in a coma. You will come out of it on your own in a few days. But you have already learned what you must do. You must use your gift.” She didn’t tell him that the injury had also triggered some curious changes in his brain. She suspected these changes were behind his new facility with entanglement, but she wanted to understand it better before discussing with him.
“But how can I do anything lying here, inert?”
“As I explained, there are others like you on your world. You are fortunate. One of them is near enough to help. And he himself knows who this Davis is that did this. He is committed to stopping him.”
“Can’t you just message him or whatever you call this and tell him where I am?”
She hesitated, considering how much to tell him at this point. “He’s not quite at that point. I am entangling with him now, as we speak. I can get him to be alert to entanglement. You must do the rest. Just as you did with Lina.”
“But how will I know who he is?”
“His name is Alton Winchester. I will share my memories of his mind.”
She let Raefe feel what he needed to reach out and find Alton.
“I’m sorry you have to learn all of this under such dire circumstances. Normally, this would be a joy for you. But now, I want you to imagine you are a hawk. You are not hunting. You are soaring high above your body, gliding over the country side. Find the sun and put it behind you on your left. Let your mind ride northeast and you will find Alton. I must disengage now — you are not strong enough to connect with me and find him.”
“Will you be back?”
“Yes, but not so soon. You cannot think of me as the fairy godmother in one of your children’s stories. I can only help you help yourself and I have no magic powers. You and Alton — you can have an impact on your own lives, your own world. You can turn this around.”

Raefe could still feel Lina’s mind. She was calmer now, but he could feel her despair, like water behind a damn. He forced himself to focus, remembering Aleron’s instructions. He let the dozens of minds around him recede as he rose above him, feeling down and out from the valley. There were more minds, faint glowing balls of energy, scattered in every direction.
How could he even find the sun? Aleron didn’t realize how overwhelming this was. All of the minds he touched, their eyes were open. It must be day, so that was good. Every now and then he could feel someone recoil from the light, as if they had looked up into a bright sun. Slowly, he assembled a picture of the sky. He put the sun to his left and behind him, as she had instructed. He imagined a compass dial and headed northeast.
This was easier now, feeling only those minds in his path. He wasn’t just listening for them now. He felt like a net stream, broadcasting his song in front of him. He smiled, thinking of a dance tune he and Lina liked. He imagined his ‘wings’ flapping slightly to the groove, the wind like the sound of a flute in the tune. He added his own words — Alton, you can make free, Alton, where you be? Alton, Lina needs you now, Alton, find us somehow. 
Just for a second, he thought he heard someone answer. He wanted to sing louder but his strength was ebbing. He felt himself circling slowly down, his singing fading, gradually gliding in circles down…</Text>

            <Text>Not just a game
March 22, 2049
First thing Monday, Raefe marched into Roshi’s office. He needed time and he needed money to get to Kenya. Once Aleron had connected him with Lina, they had sent their thoughts back and forth every time they were able to for the last three days. She was OK, but he couldn’t let her go through this alone. And she thought that there was enormous potential in Dabaab for them to do something. So he needed to get there.
“I never mentioned this, but I have a girl friend, and she’s in some trouble. I need to visit her, soon. And for awhile.”
“Just like that, you are leaving us?” Roshi looked up. “If I wanted staff who were going to do as they please and up and leave, I would get undergrads. And not have to pay them.”
“No, that’s just it,” he said. “I want to work more. I want to know if you can give me hours, and more money.”
“In my youth, young men talked like that either because they were getting married or getting their girlfriends an abortion.”
“No, it’s nothing like that. She’s in Kenya — that’s where she’s from. She was working out in the boonies and Shabab raided, and she had to flee. Her parents can’t help — it’s complicated — but she needs my help.”
“How much time are you talking about?”
“Maybe a month? But not until I earn enough to get there and back.”
“How much do you need?”
“Maybe 10k?”
“Talk to Elise. She’s stuck. See what she needs. If you can work out a plan where you build them the next phase, you can go off while they do their part and be back in time for when they’ll need you again. I have no money, but I’ll borrow from the end of the project. Timewise, it’ll be the same span as MiniWorlds expected. They don’t have to know what happened between start and finish.” 
“Roshi, thank you so much. I’ll work it out with Elise.”
He ran down the hall to the lab. Elise and Jim were heads down. He told himself to be calm, this was all going to work out.
“Hey, you got a minute?” he asked Elise quietly. No need to bring Jim into the picture yet.
“Sure, what’s up?”
“Can we talk in your office?”
She gave him a puzzled look but got up and they walked over to her office, just big enough for a desk and two chairs. He closed the door.
“Sorry for the drama,” he said, “but I have a favor to ask you. I talked to Roshi and she said I should talk to you.”
“What’s up?” she asked.
He told her what he had told Roshi. 
“So you want to know if there’s some big next thing you can burn the midnight oil to do for the next month, and then take off for a month? Have it got that right.”
“Exactly.”
“I wish there was. I’m sure Roshi told you we’ve discovered very little so far.”
“Stuck was the word she used.”
“Fair description.”
“Maybe I can help. What are you actually trying to learn?” Raefe asked Elise. He could feel her resistance to answering, but couldn’t tell why.
“Listen, if I tell you that, you may tilt the code to help me. It’s only natural.”
“You forget, this is my job. You have a lot on the line — you’re trying to attach you’re name to a certain idea. I’m just doing a job. And I can’t create the right code if I don’t know what the goal is. For me, what you say is just a spec. Soon, I’ll be back doing games for idiots, so don’t worry.”
“You don’t really believe that,” she said, grabbing his forearm. “You have so much talent.”
Ah, now he understood. She wouldn’t just be telling him a spec, but bringing him deeper into her world. For her, this was intimate and therefore complicated. He’d have to think about how to navigate this. Seeing what people felt did not always help understand how to respond, he was learning that more and more.
“Thanks, coming from you that means something. Listen, do you want to grab a cup of coffee? We can talk this thing through in a more relaxed way.” He thought she needed to get out of the pressure cooker of the lab if she was going to consider something new.
“Sure,” she said, just the hint of a blush in her cheeks. “Can you give me 15 minutes?”
“Do you know where Izzy’s is? Why don’t I meet you there?”
“Down Windsor Street?”
“That’s it.”
*****
“I’ve never been here,” she confessed.
“What?” Raefe was incredulous. “You’ve been at the Toot for six months and never had the best coffee within half a mile? Never mind the empenadas.”
“In Brazil, you must not be so casual about going to sketchy places.”
“Why do you think it’s sketchy here?”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend,” she said, clearly uncomfortable. “Poverty is everywhere in my country, and you have to develop a sense of what is dangerous. Look at that housing complex across the street — it looks like one of those Gangsta vids from my grandpa’s day. People watch those vids in Brazil.”
“Here too,” he said. “50 years ago, it was what they used to call a housing project. Mostly people from the Caribean. It had some drugs and violence, but even then, it wasn’t so bad. But that’s how Izzy’s got started — this was just  the food the people across the street were used to eating. Now it’s all perfectly harmless young people of all sorts. Small, cheap apartments for kids out of college slogging it out in entry level jobs. So they added Mochacinos and Cubanos to the Bustelo for coffee choices, and they have low-carbon salads. Solar greenhouses and all that.”
“Those are all college graduates living there?” she said, somewhat startled.
“That was me my first year at MiniWorlds,” he said. He felt her try to absorb the implications of that. He could sense her immediate and instinctive response was that she was somehow now associated with the underside of society, that she was in the wrong place. And then she scolded herself, both for allowing that which had been hammered into her to surface and for fearing him and people like him. 
“I think maybe you don’t have such a clear picture of life here,” he said, trying to put her at ease. “The Toot is something of a bubble — most of the Americans and all of the foreign students come from pretty elite backgrounds. Most of them would share your preconceptions.”
“But not you?” she asked, her thoughts saying she wanted to unlearn her prejudice.
“I went to UMass, the college run by the state. It’s a good school, but it’s for the foot soldiers — when you get out, you go into teaching, or city government. Or coding, or managing a small biomanufacturing team, or triage officer at a clinic. You’re not likely to become a banker or a high level manager. Hell, you probably won’t even be a software architect, a bio research team leader, or something like that unless you get a bit lucky or are just surprisingly brilliant.”
“But you are so smart,” she said.
“Thanks,” he smiled. “Got it from my dad. My father was one of the last of the old-time coders. He could actually write thousands of lines of code, create whole applications. Back then, they had huge libraries of functions and components. He knew half a dozen different ones like the back of his hand. He worked on the big power grid renewal projects, after the Hackalypse exposed how weak the old grid was. He spent about 10 years doing that. By the time I was in high school, when he was done, the first tech like CodeEngine was coming out. He knew nothing of that. He couldn’t get a job for two years.”
“What did you do?”
“Well, my mom was still teaching, so we had a little money coming in. I had a bunk bed from when my older brother was younger, and we rented the top bunk out to various people, which helped a bit. But eventually we had to move to a smaller apartment. And then we had to go on Min.”
“Min?”
“Minimum Standard Living Allowance. Basically, the government pays you to eat and sleep if you can avoid breaking the law.  And then my Dad  taught himself how to install solar panels and moved off to Oregon, so we got off that. I’d already been accepted at UMass so I stayed behind.”
She stared off to the side, taking it all in. He could feel her wrestling with this new information, trying to put it into some context that made sense to her.
“I have not lived in a bubble as much as you think I have. Maybe someday I will explain that. But clearly, more than I thought.”
“No worries.”
“No, it is a worry. Lies, so many lies. In science, we know everything we believe is both right and not fully right, and we are always looking for something more true. And sometimes, we foolishly think the whole world works that way. And then someone has to slap us and show us the lies in front of us. Anyway, thank you for telling me that.”
He could feel a mountain of sadness and anger in her, something in her past. In her homeland.
“I just wanted you to understand that you don’t have to worry about me getting too involved,” he said. “I don’t want to — I know I’m a guest. It’s a great project, I really enjoy it. But I know it will end, and I’ve always known that. But this is the most meaningful work I’ve done yet and I want to contribute. If you don’t tell me what this is really about, I can’t.”
“Well, it’s what Roshi explained — that we’re trying to recreate the evolution of society through simulations so that we can understand what the most important variables are.”
“But nothing we’ve tried has worked. Not even close.”
“Not your fault,” she said. “Think about how we have structured it.”
“We’ve tried giving the players more food, less food, more education, less education. Health, housing. I don’t feel like we’ve missed much.”
“But we have,” she said. Suddenly, her thoughts flashed in front of him — an image of a lone Paleolithic hunter, then a group of them. Then a woman struggling to plug a hole in her grass hut as flood waters rushed in, then an image of a tribe all pushing logs together across a rising stream.
“What? Behaviour?”
“Yes, very good. Listen, you don’t have the full picture. Do you know who is funding our work?” she asked.
“No, actually. I never thought about it. I just thought, well, the Toot does stuff like this.”
“Yes, they do,” she smiled. “But most of the research here has some kind of corporate or government funding to it. We are not doing science for science sake, as an old phrase went. We are doing science for someone’s sake. In this case, it’s the Reagan Institute.”
“Never heard of them. What’s their deal?”
“Their deal is to keep free market capitalism alive.”
“I thought it was already dead,” he said. “Didn’t we move on after the Crash of ‘37 to social capitalism? We have the Min, and Basic Home, Health and Education and Workforce Entry.”
“And yet here we are, sitting across from a former slum where now highly educated youth struggle to pay the rent, as you have now informed me. One of the advantages of being in the bubble, as you call it, is that people find it necessary to speak a little more openly to their fellow bubble residents. What do you think governs just how Min and Basic social capitalism is for those who depend on it?”
“Ah, I see where your heading,” Raefe said. The elite do. They’re not giving it all up just because some person got elected president by promising a new day.”
“And the elite fund things like the Reagan Institute which tries to scope out policies that will keep the poor from revolting while still allowing the elite to retain and grow their wealth.”
“And why do they care about the evolution of civilization?”
“Actually, they could give a flying fuck about the evolution of civilization,” she said, with more bitterness than he had expected. “This project has a hidden agenda — what is the minimum level of resources that the minimum number of people will require from, as they see it, the wealthy, or more accurately, the worthy, in order to keep society from collapsing? At the end of the day, all the wealthy conceded from the ‘37 debacle was that they had to give some ground. Like the man who finds out that he can still rape women, but must be satisfied  with only one or two victims a day. And not expecting them to smile.”
“And then announces that the threat of mass rape has ended,” he said, wondering if she was speaking from personal experience.
“Yes, my smart friend, exactly. So what we have been doing is seeing what happens if you cut calories by 20%, or reduce family allowances to tilt toward just 1child, and so on. Roshi actually believed that we could learn about human society this way. But Roshi is not a computational person. She came from the qual side and doesn’t see why this won’t work.”
“I guess I don’t understand either.”
“I’ll try and explain. Think about astronomy in the Renaissance. You started, in 1300, with Europeans believing that Sun revolved around the Earth.”
“And then Copernicus disproved that and showed the Earth revolved around the Sun.”
“Well, not exactly. What Copernicus actually did was to take ancient Greek ideas about the planets moving in perfect circles and make the Earth move in a perfect circle around the Sun, inside a perfect sphere. He wasn’t so sure about the other planets, though, and he and the rest of the scientific community — they called themselves natural philosophers back then — played with all of these variants. What if the outer planets moved around the Earth, or inside other polygons, and so on. The point is, their model of planetary motion was missing the most essential element: what makes the planets move at all, and in the way they do?”
“Right, Newton figured that out.”
“Mostly, yes, and almost 300 years after Copernicus.  And then Einstein made it true on the scale of the universe. In the meantime, none of their existing astronomical models — simulations, if you will — explained the known past, the present, or the near future of the planets. Things you could see with your own eyes — the coming of spring, a lunar eclipse, the rising and setting of Mars — these could not be accurately accounted for in their sims. Nonetheless, they kept tinkering — adding a little here and a little there. Until Newton saw that it was all governed by underlying, universal forces.”
“And that’s what we’re missing?”
“Your simulation code, at our direction, is basically a long equation that that’s something like ax + by + cz, with many more variables. When our subjects play it, we see what happens when we make “a” bigger, or “c” negative. But the relationships between x and y and z stay the same. If society really worked that way, we would have proved it already. But it doesn’t. Because we’re asking the wrong questions. Actually, we’re being paid to ask the wrong questions, because those are the questions our sponsors want answered.”
“And you want to know what’s the gravity of social evolution?”
“Yes! Exactly. We want to give Reagan some answer, but their whole question is flawed. So we’ll hack something out of the data and it will be years before they realize it’s meaningless. But Jim and I desperately want to advance the question in a big way.”
“So how do we do that?”
This time her smile was actually happy. “I thought you’d never ask,” she said. “We need you to hide certain dynamics in the code, and then show us how to run the game so that we can satisfy the grant, but also do what we want. And Roshi can’t know, much less the RI guys.”
“You understand that every game I build is just a projection of dynamics on to a set of contraints?”
“Maybe. What do you mean by that?”
“Every day at my usual job I take a game engine that takes input, puts it through some algorithms, and then feeds it to game rules, which then feed it back to a visualization engine. And I hook it up to different customers’ game rules and visualization engines.”
“You’re saying that the input, the data normalization algorithms, the game rules and the visualization are all separable?”
“Now who’s the smart kid? They are already separated. There’s no reason why I can’t  feed the normalized data through two sets of rules — yours and theirs. We can store your game rule output and then you and Jim can run the vids after hours and see what you can see.”
“That’s fantastic.”
“You should have asked me sooner.”
“Yes, I can see that now.” 
They agreed he would spend the next month working day and night to build the second set of rules and the plumbing to run two sims off of one data set and deliver two outputs. One would be for Reagan, one for Elise and Jim. Elise assured him she’d handle Roshi and smooth it out. Once he had completed the code, they’d do a short QA cycle. Then he could go off while they had people come in and play the games. Some would see the Reagan output, some would see the real output, but they’d get usable data from both. When he got back, they move on to the final phase of fine tuning the game based on what they’d learned from the new rules.
Later, he found Lina. It was late there, but she had been waiting for him. She hadn’t expected that he would be able to pull this off so soon, but she was more than excited to hear that he would be there soon. And she wanted to know more about this sim; it meshed with things she had observed in Dabaab. 
“Funny how this is working out,” Raefe said. “We were two kids scruffling to find a place, and then we were driftwood washed up on an island. And now we’re head-skyping about shit that’s all cutting edge. And we’re on that edge.”
“You’re going to be amazed when you get here,” Lina said. “It’s like visiting the future.”
“As long as we don’t have to visit the past.”</Text>

            <Text>New Voodo
November 9, 2048
 In the morning, they piled on to flat bed trucks that took them to the beach. They drove along empty, broken asphalt roads, a black ribbon through the grey forests, leaves long killed by years of salt-laden hurricanes. Here and there, the dead wood was streaked black from lightning fires. Around a corner, the sun shone bright off something green. They drove closer —— it was algae growing in the salt ponds, safe from the ocean waves. 
The beach was a different story. There were trucks, piles of materials, many trucks unloading prisoners and supplies. Zodiacs came and went. They sat huddled in one, then get off on a sandbar. The seals barked at one end while they stood knee deep at the other, building a pylon out of recycled plastic blocks. The morning sun warmed the shallows but by afternoon the clouds had rolled in and they could no longer feel their feet. The guards let them rotate in and out of the water, giving them a few minutes to get the feeling back in their feet.
Raefe found himself sitting on mound of building supplies next to the man who had interrupted Robertson back in Somerville. He tipped his head to Raefe and grunted a “Hey.”
“Alton Winchester,” the man said. “And I’m guessing you’’re Raefe?”
“How do you know my name?”
“I saw with you with Lina. Used to see her down at the K&amp;K. She talks about you a lot.”
“I dug what you did the other day.”
One of the guards came over and glared at them.
“Alright ladies, I’m sure your little footsies are warm enough now. Back to work.”
As they trudged back into the water, Alton looked back for an instant, mouthing “Look me up tonight.”
That night, in the mess tent, they found Alton and sat down next to him.
“So here we are,” Alton said to Lina. “Two fugees trying to survive the apocalypse again. And not even Kayam’s Cubanos to make it almost worthwhile.”
“You don’t miss a beat with that Goodstuff Benjamin track,” Lina said.
“Who’s that?” Raefe asked.
“Me and Alton always ago round about him,” Lina said. “He’s a Nigerian guy Alton’s into.”
“He’s not just a guy,” Alton said. “He’’s a teacher, a leader. He’s the head of the New Voodo Army. They’re into mass resistance to the corpos, the mercs, the religious extremists.”
“So pretty much every authority figure in the world,” Raefe laughed. “Who’s left to run things?”
“They are,” Alton said. “That’s the point. The NVA is all about self-determination.””
“Alton, before you give us that speech,” Lina said, “I have to ask you. Did we just go from being fugees in Somerville to prisoners on an island?””
“You’re not wrong,” Alton said. “Technically, we can leave. But we give up any claim to any benefits or support. Total free agents.”
“Son of a bitch,” Lina swore. “Where would we go?”
“Wherever we go, we are always in the diaspora. Nothing has changed.”
“When I came here five years ago, I thought I was leaving all that behind.”
“Same for me. I came here in ‘39 from Jamaica, after the plague. I was one of the 5%, the immune ones.”
“What’s going on,” Raefe asked. “What just happened to us anyway?””
“They only tell us half the story,” Winchester said. “I’ve been in touch on the Net with different folks.  That storm was the worst since the ‘41 floods. But the impact was the biggest ever because it hit so many people and it was in the belly of the beast. The New York financial center. The Boston bioinformatics complex. The  US economy brought to its knees. Beaches littered with dead fish. Fresh water reservoirs turned into salt ponds.””
“Where does this all fit in?” Raefe said, waving around the chopper.
“Looks like Digi swooped in, forced the Feds to give them a lot of East Coast territory. It’s a disaster zone now, but they get to run their own economic zones near all the big metro hubs. They pay no taxes, they can squeeze their competitors, and call the shots about what gets rebuilt and what doesn’t. First thing they want to do is protect their investment, get this sea wall up.”
Later that night, Raefe lay awake on his cot, still but unable to sleep. For much of his life, he had felt overwhelmed by the constant flux of people and their feelings. This place reminded him of a long car ride he had taken as a little boy, somewhere out in the midwest where it was empty between the cities. Everyone still had cars back then, and there was still radio, before they all got Voices and eyeball ‘‘puters and everything was there on the Net. His mom sat in the front seat, trying to find music on the radio dial. But there was nothing but static, the empty sound of the universe.
Now, his mind was a radio, and he could hear faint signals from all the stations in all the minds around him. Most of it was fatigue and despair. But there were notes of affection for friends, happiness over small things, and always, the desire to hope. I have a gift, he thought, that I don’t know what to do with. Where was Mars Girl when you needed her?

            <Text>White Christmas
December 22, 2081

Raefe knew something was wrong as soon as he opened his eyes. The sun had just risen over Newcastle, a time when the various minds that wandered in and out of the the ruined tenement off Whitehall Street were usually deep in dreams.  Now he could feel a tense energy from Gordo and his Urban Gypsies.
“Your up early,” he thought, reaching out to Gordo.
“Just about to wake you,” Gordo replied. “We’ve got to move.”
“I’ll be right there.”
He pulled on some pants and a shirt and made his way across the warren of rooms, halls and broken down walls that traversed the block of flats on the second floor. Below, the first floor was little more than sidewalls and rubble that had been torched during one of the battles between Hindu and Muslim refugees in ‘74. Gordo was hunched over a map in the room that served as the Gypsies headquarters.
“You heard the weather?” Gordo asked without looking up.
“More about the Gulf Stream disappearing?” Raefe asked.
“It’s official. Five straight days of plunging ocean temperatures. Dropped 4 degrees in one day — never been seen before in recorded history. Gulf Stream officially submerged, Greenland ice melt covering the North Atlantic. Very cold winds started building up off Iceland yesterday afternoon.”
“So why the early morning drill?”
“We’ll probably have to evacuate to warmer ground,” Gordo said. “First estimates are for historic snows within the week — two to three meters is the guess.This neighborhood will be buried by the blizzard and the city will leave it that way until nature melts it. We’d be buried alive if we stayed.”
“Where can we go?” Raefe asked.
“Out of Northern England — It’s going to be part of the same ice cube as Scotland and Ireland. Maybe even the Irish Sea will freeze over. So it’s Cornwall,” Gordo answered. “The last of the Gulf Stream still reaches that far. Warm winds will turn the snow to rain down there, but at least we won’t freeze to death.”
“How are we going to get over the border into the South?”
“We’re working on it. Can you help?”
“Well, if I had any friends in the City of London, Limited, they might grease the skids for entry into the Republic of South England. But maybe a friend of a friend — some of the minor corpos occasionally waver in their affection for economic dictatorship. I’ll see what I can do.”
Back in his room, he decided to contact Lina. It was an hour later in Nigeria, and she was an early riser anyway. He let his mind wander, settling into the noise of so many minds, and reached out for her. Soon, she responded.
“My northern light,” she said, “What raises you from sleep so early?”
“Your equatorial warmth, my dear,” he replied. “Newcastle is pretty cool, as my great-grandfathe might have said, but now it’s in danger of becoming just cold. Very cold.” He explained what was going on.
“This is what we feared for twenty years,” she said. “And now it may come to pass. What can you do?”
“For now, not much. We have to go south or we could be trapped in a killer storm. That means South England and that means United Financial Services territory. The Gypsies are hoping to find a friend to keep us off USF’s radar until I get to the Low Islands and friends. Do you think anyone in Kuti has friendly contacts in South England?”
“Very likely.  USF has waged an on again, off again campaign against Nigerian cybergangs for decades. Sometimes they buy off the best hackers and move them to London. Maybe someone here has a relative, or a friend. Most of the cybergangs are thugs, but every now and then one of them helps the Voodo Republic. Insurance policy, I guess.”
“I can help,” a voice said, joining the waveform.
“Nyssa,” Raefe said, “so good to hear you. You were listening in?”
“No, not really. But some part of me feels when both of you are connected. Instead of just the feel of single thoughts, it’s more like a chord. Did you know that? The two of you always make the same chord, like it’s your theme music. I’ve been worried about you, dad, hearing the news about the weather in Scotland.”
“You always find new ways to amaze me, daughter,” Lina said. 
“Well, Des can do the same,” Nyssa said. “More actually. He can hear the chord for a whole group of people. When we were kids, sometimes we would hide from you two. I could feel the two of you coming. But once, mom, you came with Edna and Fatima and a whole bunch of others and he knew it right away. He told me every person that was coming and he got it right.”
“Another time we should talk about what this means, how it might be developed for good,” Lina said. “Bu for now, how might you help your father?”
“Do you remember that boy I liked when I was a teenager? Manfred?”
“You mean the one we both hated?” Raefe said.
“Yes, that one. Well, you were mostly right about him. He wound up going to Lagos to one of the corpo unis there. He’s very bright, you know, and he was ambitious back then — not so interested in the greater good. He was recruited by a local subsidiary of UFS and they moved him to London four or five years ago. He’s married and all that, but we kept in touch just a bit and you weren’t totally right. Turns out he’s actually appalled by corpo life and doesn’t know what to do — they basically own him, so he can’t just walk out. I was just talking to him last week. He wants to know how he can help.”
“Do you trust him? Have you entangled with him?” Lina asked.
“More tangled than entangled,” she laughed. “But that was a long time ago. No, he’s afraid of that. Still I get some vibes from him, so yes, I think I can trust him.”
“We’re thinking of going to Devon. Is there anyway he can help there?”
“I’ll ask. Sit tight, I’ll let you know soon.”</Text>

Traveller’s Perch
November 17, 2081
“One last item that I want to make the council aware of,” Hankori said. “We haven’t discussed Earth much in recent years, but things have continued to deteriorate there. Much as we expected, humans seem unable to escape a downward spiral of environmental destruction and social violence. Green, do you have anything to add to that?”
“Not really. Just that I will soon re-assign Adno to other duties. I no longer see what there is to gain by having an Ambassador to Earth.”
The waveform reverberated with agreement from the rest of the Council.
“It seems we have consensus on that. Let us know when it is done. And with that, we are adjourned.”
Hankori and Green had come to the Council offices for the meeting, and now they walked through it’s quiet corridors.
“How did the summit go?” Green asked.
“Quite well. Warren can be very persuasive, especially when he’s promising them an entire world and immortality.”
“Why are you bothering with this? Why not just let nature take its course?”
“Green, sometimes you lack imagination. Did you think we would just be sending the humans drugs and gadgets?”
“In fact, yes. What are you saying?”
“We will have to remake them. Change their genes, the way they raise children, their whole society.”
“Why?”
“Do you think that once we have perfected e12, we would just implement it on ourselves? What if it doesn’t work as we had hoped? What if there are unforeseen consequences?”
“Yes, I’ve wondered all along about that. How can the humans help us with that?”
“There will be millions of them, living in a controlled environment. Their breeding will be controlled by us, as will their food supply.”
“You’re not saying we would use them as test subjects?”
“I’m saying exactly that. They will be our living laboratory. You seem dismayed.”
“We’re going down a road here that is very dangerous.”
“Green, my friend, we have been on that road all along. You are only now seeing that.”
They walked in silence until they reached the door to the street. Hankori strode off briskly, Green watching him disappear around a corner. He was rattled by their talk, but he knew what he had to do.
*****
“The moment we all feared is close,” Adno said. “I’ve been reassigned from Earth.”
“To what?” Diver asked.
“That’s just it. Nothing. And no one is taking my place. Green seems to be running things, for Hankori, no doubt.”
“I’m glad you called us here, Adno,” Mari said.  “I’ve been monitoring some of the Guardians back on A’Nonto and something seriously messed up is going on. Can you guys listen to this?”
She sent them her memories of Hantikori’s recent conversation with Green, and some of Hankori’s memories of his conversations with Billy Warren.
“Can you believe this?” Antithikos said, his thoughts tinged with anger. “This Hantikori is really just too much.”
“We have to tell Raefe and Lina,” Mari said.
“No!” Flier said. “With Hankori and Green in charge, they’ll know everything that goes through the wormhole interface.”
Anti and Mari looked uncomfortable.
“You should not worry about that, Flier who has flown between planets,” Adno said. “I, who have also flown between planets, can swim far distances with my mind. With many minds. No Guardians will know.”
“What are you saying, Adno?” Diver said. Was Adno just using some of her usual watery metaphors, or was there more to it.
“When Mari explained to you how our people have always been entangled,” she replied, “she did not tell you the entire story. Because I learned to entangle without the wormhole interface network, I don’t really need it. Once I learned to sing the Guardian waveform, I was capable of finding it without Guardian technology.”
“This changes everything,” Flier said. “We have a secret weapon, Diver! We can fight back!”
“You have other secret weapons, father mom,” Mari said. “Because I learned this skill from Adno, and Anti did too, we were able to teach it to Des and Nyssa. After all, when were both inside mommom, she had much contact with Raefe and Lina, and through Lina to her twins inside her.”
“Ah, the universe continues to tickle us,” Diver said.”But this is great news. We must bring Raefe and Lina into the picture.”
*****
Lina bolted awake. Raefe’s slow slide into sleep ended abruptly.  Suddenly they had both joined the waveform Adno had created. She was there, along with Des and Nyssa, and Diver and Flier and Anti and Mari. It was somehow stronger and more vivid than their normal connections.
“We have news for you that’s urgent, and some other matters, too,” Adno said.
“Go ahead,” Raefe said, back safely from London.
“Yeah, ready here in Dadaab,” Lina said.
“We want you to know that something rotten is happening with the Guardians,” Adno said. “They are ending their guardianship of Earth. I’ve been reassigned.”
“We’ve kept you out of a lot of Guardian politics over the years,” Diver said, “because we had no thought it would go this far. But now you need to know. Flier was pushed out of the directorship some time ago and a man named Hankori  took over.”
“We think he’s insane,” Flier said. “We also think he’s interfering with Earth in a big way.”
“Before Diver was ambassador to Earth,” Adno said, “Hankori was for about 10 years. He failed miserably at it, but now I think that he planted some seeds there. He has interfered with a variety of bad people and continues to this very day. I’m quite sure that he as regular contact with a man named Billy Warren.”
“Warren? Now things are starting to make sense,” Raefe said. “Warren is allied with other large corpos. One of them is Ken Robertson. His security forces have been trying to kill me — they took a shot at me just recently.”
“And we’ve heard through other sources,” Nyssa said, “that the corpos recently had a secret meeting of global leaders. They can rarely agree on what kind of water to drink, so it must have been important.”
“I think our source inside the corpos will tell us more,” Raefe said. “Nyssa, can you contact him again?”
“Yes, sure,” she said. “And Adno, can you try and go deeper on your end?”
“We all will,” Adno replied.
“OK, I think this is actually a great moment,” Raefe said. “The declaration of Everywhere seems to have stirred the hornet’s nest, as it were. But you know, I’m puzzled. This all feels different than usual. Somehow closer. Is something different.”
“You were always so attuned,” Diver said. “And you are right. Flier and I have been surprised about this new development, too, just a little while ago. We’ll let Adno explain.”
“What Diver taught you about entanglement is really only part of the story,” Adno said. “My people, for example, are always entangled as a school and have no need of the Guardian interface network. Mari learned that from us, and she taught Anti. Because both of them knew you while they were inside Diver, they knew your signatures at birth. And Des and Nyssa’s. And as twins, they have always known each other in the waveform as well.” 
“You’re saying that the eight of us, and maybe all of Adno’s school, can maintain a waveform across these great distances but outside of the Guardian network?” Lina asked.
“Yes,” Anti said. “Just so. I’m not entirely sure why — my guess is that the Guardian network is actually a simplified, artificial version of a vast natural set of connections that span the galaxy, if not the universe. I don’t understand the physics of it — do our thoughts ride through extra dimensions, do they make the long sought cosmic strings vibrate, something else? But I know it’s real. Once we show you how to initiate the connections, you’ll see it’s actually easier to use than the Guardian network.”
“This changes everything. We’ll have the advantage of surprise,” Raefe said.
“Just what we thought, old friend,” Flier said.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Train is attacked and everyone is taken prisoner. Raefe is injured.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raefe woke with a start as the train came to a sudden halt. His Voice chirped and announced that the train had stopped due to routine maintenance on the track ahead. Wow, he thought, when did the train company start paying for maintenance? Usually they just waited for a break down and then fixed it.
Lina looked like she had been awake for a while.
&quot;Where are we?&quot;
&quot;Near Richmond, I think,&quot; she said. &quot;But something's up. Look out the window, to your right.&quot;
There was smoke up ahead, black rolling clouds. Something big was burning, maybe only a kilometer away. They went between the cars, trying to look out, but the smoke was thick up ahead and they couldn't see past it. He ask his Voice for news about Richmond.
&quot;There are 781 reports of fire, fighting and police activity. How should I focus?&quot; the Voice wanted to know.
&quot;Fighting,&quot; he replied, now getting nervous. Occasionally thieves boarded the high-speed luxury trains, but who would want to jack a solar train? He and Lina had nothing to steal anyway.
&quot;Reports from citizens on local sites say about 200 armed men have attempted to take over Richmond City Hall. These reports are unconfirmed by police or other official sources.&quot;
&quot;What is the government here?&quot; Raefe asked. &quot;Any chance police will come?&quot;
&quot;Difficult to determine,&quot; the Voice answered. &quot;Nominally, still part of Virginia and the United States, but that doesn't count for much. United Energy Resources is trying to extend its semi-autonomous corporate tax-free zone east from West Virginia, and Richmond is high on their list of next places to annex.  They've been recruiting in the area.&quot;
&quot;Raefe, we should go,&quot; Lina said, her fear palpable.
&quot;Go where?&quot;
&quot;I don't know, we should find a place to hide. They may board the train.&quot;
&quot;Or maybe they don't give a soot about the train and we'll just be making it harder on ourselves. What do we do if the train takes off while we''re hiding?&quot;
Before she could answer, a gunshot went off close by. The car door burst open and half a dozen men burst in, military guns but ragtag uniforms.
&quot;Listen up,&quot; announced a scrawny white man, almost a boy, at the front of the group.  &quot;Richmond, Virginia has been liberated by the Snakehead Militia, fighting for the United States of White America. You are riding a solar train, which is forbidden in our territory. You will be escorted off the train, and taken to New Dixie, our encampment. Once we've secured the area, we'll make arrangements for you to be on your way.&quot;
&quot;Shit, they're  real, the Confeds,&quot; Raefe whispered.
&quot;We need to get out of here, if we can,&quot; Lina said, trying not to move her mouth. Raefe could feel the sweat on her palms. There was plenty of rumors on the net about the Confeds. Wacked out Wyn heads, outlaw diesel bikers, mercs who hadn't had a job since they were run out of Mexico, the nets couldn't agree on who these guys were. Except, they were white, as in White.
The platoon herded them off the train and made them line up along the narrow corridor that separated the woods from the tracks. There were closer to 50 than the 200 reported with the usual net exaggeration, but they had at least 200 weapons, ranging from knives to tasers to small submachine guns. Up close, they looked more sick than dangerous. Pale skin and thinning hair, looking old even at 19 or 20. The water in the coal fields was mostly polluted, it was a heavy metal gruel that slowly sapped the strength of those who drank it, weakening even their genes. They were the last of the last in that part of the country, held there by fear, family ties, crooked preachers and lying corpos long after the land gave up on them.
He could see one of them was the leader. He seemed to have a little spark about him, a luminescence that shone through the dirty pale skin and the greasy hair. He had a T-shirt with a faded picture of a group of bearded men in 19th century clothes, and the words, &quot;Like my brother below me, I took a rebel stand.&quot; He had a nanotat circling his neck. It was off, but Raefe could make out different geometric patterns. 
&quot;What you looking at, white boy?&quot; the Confed said. He shook his head quickly and the tats woke up. Red and black symbols -- maybe it was the Confederate flag with Nazi swastikas added to it -- orbited his neck. &quot;You''re in White America, now. What once was lost, now is found – you're looking at the real symbols of your country.&quot;
Raefe didn't know if he was joking or insane. Still, he could feel the energy of this kid. Best not to test him. He would have to be careful talking with him.
&quot;See, it hurts me to see a white man scared to see the symbols of his own heritage, and taking comfort with lesser creatures. I told you not to worry, we ain't gonna hurt you. &quot;
&quot;What's your name?&quot; he asked him.
&quot;People call me Jeff Davis,&quot; he replied.
&quot;But that's not your name is it? He was an original Confederate, I know that. What does your mother call you?&quot;
&quot;Why you care?&quot;
&quot;We got a situation here. I'm trying to figure out where we go from here, and I'd like to know who I'm talking to.&quot;
&quot;Jeff Davis will do for you. The situation we got is that y'all got to do as you're told, or someone is going to get hurt.&quot;&quot;
&quot;Is that what you want? I don't know what they told you back there in coal country, but people who take the solar train, we're all poor. These people been through a lot – hurricanes, tidal waves, civil wars and just plain scuffling to survive.  I see you have, too, so I'm going to tell you straight. A lot of these people have faced worse than you, and whatever power you think you have over them, they are going to make you use it.&quot;
Just then, a shot rang out about 30 meters down the track.  A group of passengers had surrounded one of the Snakehead platoons, and one of the soldiers had fired a warning shot in the air. Jeff Davis motioned and he and his men ran toward the shot. Raefe and Lina took the opportunity to melt back into the crowd, which had now swelled into one mass of all the passengers faced off with all of the Snakeheads.
Davis pushed his way to the front. &quot;Everybody calm the frick down. No need for you to be causing trouble here, we've explained to you we'll be moving you shortly.&quot;
“Moving my ass, you little shit,&quot; shouted a grizzled white guy. &quot;Who the frick you think you are, you Wyn-loser little sootface? We paid good money to take this train up North so's we can work and send money back to our families. Most of us looking to catch on with snow crews. Most of us need to be in Hartford, Connecticut bright and early tomorrow for the big New England snow remover shape up or we won't get on any of the crews. We ain't got time for your backwoods shit. Now git the frick out of our way.&quot;
More than 50 of the passengers had closed ranks behind him. Some of them had knives, some of them had found pieces of wood or had rocks in their hands.
Davis' crew looked nervous, but he was standing calm, almost bored. &quot;You are in our country now, and the law is the law.&quot; 
A young black woman and two brownish men of indeterminate ethnicity joined the older white guy at the front. They all had some kind of weapon.
&quot;Shake that coal dust out of your ears,&quot; the woman said. &quot;You must not be hearing us. You do not want to mess with snow 'sooner crews.  This is life or death for us – our only hope of making it through the winter. We work for months for this fare – salvage, nuclear reactor disassembly, solar furnace repair, whatever shit job you can think of, we've been doing it.&quot;
&quot;Lady's right,&quot; one of the brown men said. &quot;We don't catch on with a crew tomorrow, our families may not eat. Hell, we may not eat. This ain't no sim – next time one of you fires, in the air or not, these folks probably just rush right at you and beat you.&quot;
&quot;Folks, I can appreciate the difficulties of living in the sad remainders of the United States of America,&quot; Davis said. &quot;Until we can re-establish the rule of Christian law, God will not grace any of us with a decent life. You are paying for the sins of generations that ignored His teachings and broke with his ways.&quot;
&quot;Listen, boy,&quot; the white man said, &quot;Last I heard, you can still preach that shit on the net somewhere. That's your play here. Not only are we not going to stand for you messing with our work, but we ain't going to let you split us up. I might be nothing better than a snow 'sooner monkey, and I might have only gone to school long enough to learn to read and use the Net, but I ain't ignorant enough to believe all that White America crap.&quot; 
&quot;I'm trying to get you to see that there's a new order here,&quot; Davis said. &quot;And a new law, and a new law is the first step we have to take.&quot; He nodded at the boys behind him, and they all came to shooting position. &quot;Now I’'m going to count to ten, and you all are going to turn and march to the front of the train.&quot;
The white snow 'sooner looked around and some heads nodded. He looked right back at Davis and said &quot;Go frick yourself.&quot; About a dozen snow 'sooners rushed Davis and knocked him down. Everything was quiet. Then the Snakehead platoon opened fire, spraying the front rank of the crowd. Half a dozen people dropped, some moaning, some silent. The passengers were stunned, caught between rushing the Confeds and running away. Before they could make up their minds, Davis got to his feet.
&quot;Alright, that's it. Everyone of you sons of bitches, line the frick up right now or there's going to be more bloodshed!&quot;
Raefe grabbed Lina's hand, squeezing it as if to say, &quot;I'm here, we'll get through this.&quot; Her hand was limp, her mind somewhere else, steeped in fear and anger. He squeezed her shoulder, trying to calm her. He was deathly afraid she would explode at Davis and he'd lose her. He needed time to think.
The Snakeheads marched them to some flatbed trucks and prodded them with the butt ends of their rifles to get up on them. They were packed in, standing. The trucks started up, belching smoke, and set off down the highway. It was getting dark and soon he couldn't see where they were. It was all anyone could do to stay upright as the trucks bounced down the highway, which seemed to get increasingly rough. He could see from the setting sun they were going northwest, back into the Virginia hills.
They drove for about an hour and then pulled off the broken road, down a dirt path, into a clearing. There were tents and some rough shacks. The Snakeheads herded them off the trucks toward a series of small tents, each big enough for four or five people. The slit trenches behind them were all the bathroom facilities there were. 
&quot;Alright, this is how it's going to go.&quot; Davis bellowed, standing on an old milk crate. &quot;Those tents on the left, that's where all the white people are going to go. Those tents on the right, everyone else. No race mixing allowed here.&quot;
Lina turned toward him. He would never forget the look in her eyes, at once condemned and damning. He turned toward the Snakehead guard pushing him toward the white tents.
&quot;I'd like to stay with my friend,&quot; he said, trying to strike a tone of reason. &quot;She's not well.&quot;
The guard raised his rifle butt and swung it toward him. He was unconscious before he hit the ground.

            <Synopsis>Hankori learns Raefe has been taken prisoner.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Hankori wanted to shout to the heavens. He wanted to soak the waveform with his delight. He could not, of course, but savoring Salmerikon’s imminent distress would do.
Anatope had been dubious, but Hankori had been sure that they would succeed. Davis didn’t have Raefe’s talent for entangling, but he was open enough for Hankori to manipulate his emotions. Trying to control him directly wasn’t possible — he would have to do that in secret and hide, and his absence for days and weeks would be hard to explain. Anyway, it hadn’t been neccessary. Get him fixated on the solar train, make him feel taking it down would raise his profile to United Energy Resources, scratch his eternal itch about dark-skinned woman, and the gas cloud was practically a star already.
Even better luck that Raefe and Lina had been the only young couple of two colors on the trains. Sure, there were plenty such couples among the migrant workers on the train. But many were older or the women were already pretty beat up by life, but Raefe and Lina? Practically automatic that anyone as wound-up about sex as Davis would go the extra mile to force Raefe’s hand by separating the white and dark people, splitting up the couples. He’d never done that on his own for previous trainjackings. 
Usually he and his boys hit one of the more elite trains and tried to collect ransoms on the passengers. They usually just herded the people into the camp. Those that couldn’t pay up, they sold for forced labor or sex slaves. Hankori had skillfully built his irrational resentment against the solar trains over the last weeks. Davis had come to believe that somehow the fall of the coal regions had been caused by solar trains! But it was Davis himself who made the magical leap to thinking that destroying them would bring coal back. Granted,  United Energy Resources had planted that seed. The whole process showed how tenuous the Peoples’ grasp on reality actually was.
And now Raefe had gotten himself seriously injured. These People were brutes. He had no patience for Aleron’s simpering support of them. Let them top themselves and be done with it. The primitive emotions that ruled them — conquest, fear. Their whole social order was designed to prevent collaboration and cohesion. Didn’t Aleron understand the power that she possessed in her mind, the accomplishment that their level of enhancement and entanglement truly was? Her mind, clouded by all that Guardian theology. In a billion years, what had they done? Saved a few dozen civilizations in a whole galaxy. Now they had a chance to become part of the Galaxy, to change the fabric of reality itself.
She’d be ignored when Raefe failed, the Guardians would open their eyes. The whole project would lose support. Resources would flow to the lightspeed engine project. Multiple generations of Guardians, roaming farther in the galaxy than ever before, maybe nearby galaxies, too, looking for new, worthy intelligent life. At least that was how he had built support for the project.
Maybe the injury would rob Raefe completely of his powers. That would be delicious. Poor Aleron, search the Void for her pet and no signal at all. He’d wait a little to see how it played out, and let the others know. He smiled in anticipation.</Text>

            <Title>The Big Meeting</Title>
            <Text>The Big Meeting
February 3, 2049
Salmerikon had never felt the waveform so volatile at a Guardian Council meeting. It wasn’t the number of participants that made it so difficult to tune everyone in. Aside from himself, there were only representatives from the five departments—— Anatope from Timelines, Hanakori from Administration, Putnomo from Discovery, Tanoch from Ambasssadors and Manulo from Analysis — plus Aleron, summoned to explain events on Earth. No, the difficulty was in finding a wave that encompassed the full range of emotions that were brought to the meeting. He felt fear, arrogance, sadness, puzzlement, anger, gloating — not much to build resonance on. Disagreement was common among all peoples, and certainly the Guardian Council, but this was more. It felt like a will to avoid agreement, as if it were some ancient virus.
“Our task as council,” he began neutrally, “often involves difficult, even impossible, dilemmas. Our tradition has always been to stare these directly in the face. To brave the complications they entail, to find the solution that is most faithful to our principles and our mission. I ask for your help now in coming together to discuss the matters at hand. We have two key issues in front of us. One is the recent crisis on Earth — what happened, what was done, and what should come next. Two is the proposal from Discovery to launch a new initiative, a project aimed at developing a lightspeed engine. Let’s start with Earth.”
As soon as he had acknowledged the lightspeed engine project, the waveform had begun to coalesce more firmly. So this is what they really want, he thought. Why the emotion attached to it?
“Representing Timelines,” Anatope started, “I want the Council to understand that at least one timeline shift was made without our participation. We know from past experience that any number of bad things can happen when this ability is used without proper care. That is the entire reason that Timelines was created as the newest part of the Guardians. Was it an Ambassador who initiated this shift? And can they explain why?”
“No Ambassadors are trained enough to accomplish a shift,” Tanoch replied, “even if we were so inclined. What evidence do you have that it was an Ambassador?””
“I received a request from Aleron for a suitable timeline,” Anatope said. “And not long after, the shift was made.”
“Aleron?” Tanoch asked.
“Anatope is correct,” Aleron said, “but his account is incomplete. I made an initial query because I was concerned that Earth’’s general situation was deteriorating. I wanted to begin thinking about alternative Earth’s for my contacts. Anatope gave me some insight into those options.”
“And I warned you against trying to send your contact into his past to relive his mistakes,” Anatope said.
“Of course. And I made it clear that I was not interested in that. But you are wrong to say that you did not particpate in the shift.”
“Nonsene,” Anatope fired back. “We had nothing to do with it.”
 “Precisely. The situation was dire,” she said. She broadcast the records of the volcanic collapse and the tidal wave. “I had only a short time to rescue Raefe or his consciousness would have died with him. You were made aware of this.”
“Aleron is correct,” Manulo interjected. “Both in her assessment of the situation on Earth and in what she told Timelines.””
“And what was the response from Timelines?” Salmerikon asked, leaving it vague whether he was addressing Manulo or Anatope.
“I received no request from them for more information,” Manulo replied. “Typically, that would be the first step in planning a shift.””
“Because no shift had been authorized by the Council,” Anatope said. “I can only carry out the will of the Council.”
“But you knew there wasn’t time for that,” Aleron said.
“I knew you didn’t have time for that,” Anatope said, “but whose fault was that? You had already anticipated that a shift would be neccessary, yet you never bothered to inform the council.”
“A good Ambassador always considers many potential outcomes,” Tanoch said.
“Yes, precisely,” Hankori said, “and prepares for them.”
“You misunderstand my meaning,” Tanoch said. “If every Ambassador came to the Council every time they saw that the potential for a time shift had risen to a level where it was worth thinking about, we would be in constant session. I think the record suggests only that Aleron was correct in her assessment. None of us can predict the future, only see vaguely the shape it might take.”
“Let us rise above the level of petty disputes about the facts,” Salmerikon said. “The facts  are not in dispute. Aleron made a request to Timelines, and Timelines answer was to follow procedure. Do we all agree on that?”
He could sense the frustration from some of the Council who had come hoping to discredit Aleron, but no one objected to his characterization.
“So the question before us,” he continued, “is whether Timelines was right to stand on principle even if the outcome was disastrous. Especially when that principle was essentially a bureaucratic one.”
“You say that as if acting to shift the contact could not also bring disaster,” Anatope said, unyielding. “Let me remind you of the Orion disaster, when certain Guardians caused the collapse of an entire civilization across many timelines by repeated shifts without considering the consequences or even stating clear expectations of what they hope to accomplish.”
“Yes, we are all familiar with that unfortunate incident,” Salmerikon responded. “That was why, 150,000 years ago, Timelines was founded. Tanoch, did Aleron’’s training not include the lessons learned from Orion?”
“It most certainly did,” Tanoch said. “And I can feel that you are going to ask whether her actions in this case could have initiated such a spiral. My answer is no. The key feature of the Orion incident was that the Ambassador involved develop a method whereby he would direct his contact to a certain course of action. If it did not work, he would analyze the shortcomings, shift the contact to a very similar timeline and then direct him to a refined course of action based on the past failing. Ultimately, the Ambassador fell in love with his own analysis, which was on its own incorrect, and inadvertently  directed his contact to repeat this in ever more effective  ways. The contact, instead of becoming an agent for progress, became the chief architect of a conflict which, once started, could not be stopped and rampaged on for centuries. In the end, the species wound up destroying itself.”
“And I understand that,” Aleron said. “Raefe was merely a victim of a natural disaster brought on by centuries of inaction. The only thing he has learned is that Armageddon is a real possibility.”
“Yes, Armageddon is a real possility for all civilizations, even our various ones,” Salmerikon said. “And that is why our nurturance of humans is important, more important than our own rules. Our mission is to create the conditions for intelligent life to prosper and survive. Whatever inconveniences, messy situations, loose ends or confusion that brings, we must always keep that foremost in mind. I would hope that in the future, Timelines would adhere to that mission.”
Anatope remained silent.
“Fortunately, Raefe has been relocated to a more advantageous timeline. Aleron, you have entangled with him. What are his prospects?”
“Good, I believe,” Aleron answered. “He is a bit disoriented. His situation is actually more stable: he has a job, decent housing. I’’ve been talking to him about second chances. The notion that his second chance is also a second chance for his species. I am expecting it will take some months, maybe a few years, before he is able to translate that into meaningful actions. My plan is to encourage him to seek out others who he might join with. He is not a charismatic leader on his own.”
“Hang on,” Hankori interrupted. “How did you shift him without the cooperation of Timelines?”
Aleron hesitated. “I didn’t…”
“I did,” Salmerikon interjected. “Analytics had made me aware of the crisis. Once Aleron told me of the issue with Timelines, I took the necessary steps.””
“How interesting,” Hankori answered. “I was unaware that anyone but Timelines could actually access the quantum multiverse interface needed to shift someone to a new timeline. In fact, in Administration, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that each department is compartmentalized, so that no Guardian can hijack the system for their own agenda.”
“I am surprised to hear you say that,” Salmerikon answered. “You know that as Coordinator, I have the ability to access any systems. Perhaps you were unaware that in my early days in the Guardians we still practiced a system of rotation for trainees. Most of you are aware that every so often I participate in your department’s work. I’m not sure how a Coordinator can function, really, if they remain completely ignorant of what we do as Guardians.””
“I will only register my concern, then, at your interference. A matter for another time,” Hankori said.
Salmerikon could feel the waveform oscillate between those who agreed with Hankori and those who didn’t. There was no clear consensus. He was actually relieved that there wasn’t more support for Hankori’’s attempt to open the can of worms. He would be gracious and move before someone thought to ask about Lina.
“Quite,” he said. “We have much to talk about with the second item, the lightspeed drive project.”
“Yes, indeed,” Putnomo said. Everyone had sensed his growing impatience. “You have received my brief. Let me summarize. Some preliminary work by the Science team has revived interest in lightspeed travel. We are exploring some very promising new physics that will unlock this possibility. Rather than having to accelerate toward lightspeed, with all of the energy consumption and relativistic effects that entails, this new physics points to instantaneous lightspeed.”
“Given that we have effective faster than lightspeed transmission of information through wormholes, what do you see as the benefit,” Salmerikon asked.
“What if there was intelligent life that was just bad at entanglement?” Putnomo asked. “Perhaps that is even the more common scenario than being capable of it. We would never know about these species. But this new approach will allow us to contact such species, at the least.”
“Does the physics suggest that this work could lead to FTL drives,” Salmerikon asked.
“It doesn’t rule it out,” Putnomo replied. “Still early days.””
“You foresee a program of exploration?” Tanoch asked. “What part of the galaxy could be reached within the lifetime of an enhanced being?””
“Most of it,” Putnomo said. “Direct contact with life anywhere in the Galaxy should be possible, coupled with instantaneous communications of results.””
“So you see perhaps robotic vessels conducting a survey?” Manulo asked.
“That would be for us to decide, but yes, that is one scenario. Right now, my concern is to get the project into prototype mode, to build a working small-scale engine,” Putnomo responded.
“Might I ask more about the physics?” Manulo said. “What is the basic principal?”
“It’s quite complex, really,” Putnomo answered. “I’’m broadcasting some reference materials if you want to dig deeper. But the short answer is that we think that by combining advanced plasma control systems with vacuum energy modulation, we can instantaneously transform the plasma into very high levels of light pressure.”
Salmerikon made a mental note to investigate the science more thoroughly. Putnomo’s description didn’t quite make sense.
“What would you need from the council?” he asked Putnomo.
“The project will require a doubling of the energy budget and staff allocations for the entire Discovery department. It would mean a redefinition of our basic goals.”
“What you mean” Tanoch said, “is that you would shift your activities away from supporting the Ambassador’s mission, isn’t it?”
“No,” said Putnomo. “We would change what is available to the Ambassadors. Now they can merely entangle with a few individuals. This project will enable them to identify new species, and perhaps even someday, to go beyond this galaxy.”
“But until lightspeed technology actually works, and we can use it for the Ambassadors,” Tanoch pointed out, “you would essentially be allowing the current effort to stagnate, betting on a future replacement.”
“Unless our home worlds are willing to give greater support to the Guardians as a whole,” Putnomo answered. “That is not for me to decide.””
“Then I suggest that I ask each Guardian species to consider their stance on this,” Salmerikon said. “Ultimately, they must decide what future direction we want to take as Guardians. I will proceed with that. When we know the answer, we can meet to discuss again.”
Both sides accept this, Salmerikon thought. I wonder why.

            <Title>Robertson lays out the plan</Title>
            <Text>Her mother had left her in their room and gone off to one of her meetings. Nila watched a few vids and got restless. She wandered around the monastery. One corner had a shrine to elephants, who used to live in the woods nearby. She had seen pictures and hoped there would be some real ones. But it was apparent from the shrine that they were all dead now. Her teachers had given her the impression that there were still some around, but it was just another lie. Still, the shrine had a full-sized preserved elephant. It was huge! She had never really understood their size before. You could see virtual 3D ones, but somehow it wasn’t the same.
Something had been stuck in her mind since earlier and all of a sudden, she knew what it was. Her mother had said that 20 years from now, Ken Robertson Jr. would remember the look on her face when she had first met him. Of course her mom believed that Nila would still be part of New Kendall in 20 years. But that she would be someone Robertson would know? That meant her mom saw her as part of the power structure in New K. Valorie must see her as following in her footsteps, being part of the machine. OK, probably all the parents in New K thought that way — that was the whole point, right? Protect your safety through protecting your privilege.
But how little did her mom know her if she really believed that? It made her angry to even think about that. And what was moms up to anyway? All this hush, hush. Nila realized maybe she could find out. If she sat near the meeting, like in a hall, maybe she could pick up some stray thoughts. Worth a shot and she was bored anyway.
She did that thing she had learned to do where she let her mind go blank and then there was a little place where she could go in her head and then, yeah, there it was, she could feel stuff. Raefe had referred to it as the waveform. But it just felt like soft voices, maybe around the corner, only they were always just around the corner, unless you could sort of see one and then you were around the corner and you could hear more clearly. And now she could hear a buzz of voices off to the right.
She found a hallway that went right and slowly walked down it, making sure no one saw her. The voices were rising above a murmur now, almost distinct enough to hear. There were some loud ones, but mostly almost a humming. The hall turned and there was a kind of lobby and double doors. There were Sec guards making sure no one got close. She saw another hall off to one side and detoured that way. Soon she was walking parallel to the long side of whatever was behind those double doors. As she went down it, she felt her mother’s thoughts. And she could hear her actual voice, although she couldn’t make out the words, muffled by the walls.
She saw a small lounge with an open door. It was near enough yet out of the way. She sat down and put her Voice in her ear, just in case anyone came by and wondered what she was doing. She found some music she liked and played that, just in case someone asked. So she had an alibi now and she could turn her focus to what her mom was saying.
Nila wasn’t yet very good at this, so it came in dribs and drabs and sudden bursts. Valorie was very excited and it soon became obvious why. Her unit had been working on a device that could be worn in a hat or a helmet that could detect the energy of entanglement and shield your mind from it. This meant two things Valorie was jazzed about: Sec could find empaths and they could block their attempts to scan their thoughts. In fact, Valorie thought, they might not even be able to detect the presence of someone wearing one of these helmets.
Val talked for awhile longer, but Nila stopped paying attention as she got into the details of how the helmet would be made and who would be issued them and so on. It was too much to absorb, trying to imagine that New K might find a way to neutralize Everywhere. Other than her contact with Raefe, Nila had never had dealings with Everywhere. But you had to be an idiot not to know that it was only Everywhere and their allies around the world that kept New K from world domination.
Val was done and some guy was talking now. She couldn’t really pick up on him that much — she didn’t know his mind like she knew Val’s. He yammered on for awhile, but it was all just a jumble to her. And then he was done and the next guy came on. And she heard that voice again — Ken Robertson Jr. 
They’d boosted the PA for Robertson, adding music and all sorts of audio accents to his talk. She could hear it outright seeping out of the auditorium — no need to read any minds. There must be visuals, too, judging from the odd timing of some of the sounds. She turned her Voice down so she could listen. Robertson did his corpo BS stuff, thanking and congratulating all sorts of people. You didn’t have to read minds to tell it was all written down for him and he didn’t mean a word of it. He went into a long recitation of New K’s progress during the last year, which was boring and hard to follow.
Then he shifted gears and started to talk about the future.
“This will be the last year of the 21st Century,” Robertson intoned, as if he had just discovered a second moon orbiting Earth. “It’s been a century of great hardship but also great progress. Some of you may be startled to hear me say that. Progress, really? But if you were to go back 100 years, to the last turn of a century, you’d see what I am referring to.”
“At the end of the 20th Century, people seemed split into two camps. On the one side, there was the doomsday crowd. In their view, humans were ruining the planet, were selfish, and we needed to stop striving for more, stop having children, stop progress. On the other side, people like my grandfather and great-grandfather were pointing out that the sky was the limit, that we are smart enough and bold enough to solve our problems. But, and this was the big but, we had to stop putting shackles on the builders and the innovators and, frankly, the leaders who could take us into that future.
“One hundred years later, the verdict is in. The naysayers left us unprepared for changes in the weather. They left us ill-equipped to channel the massive dislocations, the political upheavals. Their small-mindedness has left the world fractured, fragmented and afraid. Their view of the 22nd century is more misery, punctuated by tiny groups of aimless do-gooders who actually are doing a lot of harm. 
“New Kendall, on the other hand, has been a beacon of hope for those who wish to continue the work of civilization, of advancing humanity. We’ve shown the masses what our leadership can bring: safety, survival, yes, but also prosperity and hope. We’ve put people first, not some vague notion of ‘the planet,’ or ‘the ecosystem’ or, heaven forfend, ‘Mother Earth.’
“In 100 years, we’ve moved the conversation to a clear choice: our proven recipe for progress versus their vague and ever-shifting plans for ‘a new and better world.’ That, in my book, is progress. That’s what we want to teach our kids to do. That’s the vision we want them to have. And so we stand on the cusp of this new century and our rallying cry — to our kids and to ourselves — has to be “Finish the job.” And finishing the job is not a matter of project management or new technology or better implementation. It’s a matter of clearing obstacles from the board. And the biggest obstacle we face is the Citizens of Everywhere.
“This group has plagued my family for decades, interrupting our work, making a general nuisance of themselves. But to be honest, we have been at a stalemate with them. Their growth has stalled out; their vaunted empathy has found its followers and failed to add many converts in the last 10 years. But I have to admit that we also have failed to dislodge them from their position of influence, which extends out beyond their practitioners and close followers. In many communities, ‘What does Everywhere say about it?’ is a key question ordinary people ask.
“But we are not going to continue to treat them as equals, as worthy adversaries. They need to be removed from the field of play. And we have the means. If you were just paying attention, our excellent Security Department has developed technology to insulate our operatives from the empaths, to make them immune to their probing and cajoling. I’m here to tell you that this is only the start.
“The exact same technology can be modified so that instead of blocking their so-called waveform, it reflects it back, amplified and focused on those who are sensitive to it. I want to show you the result.”
The room was silent now while a video showed. She couldn’t make out the sound on the video but she was getting vibes from her mother. And it was horrific. Her mother seemed to be watching an experiment in which an empath was asked to entangled with someone from New K. They had been fooled into thinking this was some harmless game or other. The New K person had some sort of device hidden on them. The empath was trying to connect. First there was a look of puzzlement on their face, then a sharp wince, then a silent scream as if something overwhelming was frying their brain. And they slumped in their chair, unconscious or dead. Even mother recoiled inwardly.
Nila felt like she wanted to vomit. At the same time, she realized that, in this moment of quiet, she was feeling Robertson’s thoughts leaking out. Was he a tangler? Did he know it? She bolted, running back to their room before someone discovered her.</Text>
            <Notes>Robertson lays out their plan to finish off Everywhere:

1. Devices to interfere with their tangling
2. Repurposing that device to attack empaths
3. Deploying their own empaths selectively to surveil and develop propaganda</Notes>

            <Text>Bootstrapping
January 17, 2050
Raefe was beside himself with frustration. He had worked for months pursuing the direction that Aleron had suggested. She had been of no further help, apparently wrapped up in her own life. At first, he had made some progress and could see that this direction could work. Joe had stepped up on his end, trying new kinds of math that could handle large numbers of interacting variables reacting with each other non-linearly. Elise had adjusted the social aspects of the sim to reflect that. They had made significant progress.
In their 100 year sim, they could not exactly reproduce the current world. But the variations were no longer random and opposite. They seemed to want to converge. Joe had been convinced that it was a computer problem. He had managed to gain access, somehow, to MIT’s mos powerful server farms. When that didn’t work, he had called in a favor from a buddy at DigiBrands and gotten two weeks of time on a prototype system, their most advanced, before it went into production. Their project was labeled as test of the system. But it hadn’t worked.
He felt Lina tickling his mind.
“Raefe, the most wonderful thing has happened.”
“Glad someone’s having a good time.”
“Your sim is not going well?”
“You know it. And I’m just stuck. I’d love some good news — what’s up with you?”
“Remember Alton?”
“Sure.”
“Well, after you left, he and the Citizens did reach an agreement of sorts. The Citizens have a high council of sorts, although it’s pretty informal. They were very worried about allying with an army, as I predicted. Anyway, they decided to try a small joint project. So last September, 100 people from each group went off together, on their own, and built a small village. The test was to see if their economic system and our social system could work together and be something more than either.”
“And did it work?”
“It was working well. Fatima was one of the people, and last week, Edna asked me to visit and see how she was doing. Something amazing happened.”
“What? You’re killing me with suspense here.”
“Fatima tried in her way, to entangle with the other people, but she’s too new at it. But when I arrived, she asked me to help and something completely unexpected happened. Fatima couldn’t sense how close everyone was, but I felt it immediately. I tried reaching out to some individuals who seemed to have the strongest signals, but they were all strong. Raefe, we did it — we created the waveform that Aleron talks about. All of a sudden, we could all sense each other, all 201 of us.”
“Holy shit. What was it like?”
“Was? Is! It is fantastic. Let me bring you into it!”
“How?”
“Just relax. You feel that?”
And just like that, as if he was looking out his window at 200 people in a park, he could feel each of their minds. It was a warm feeling, what his grandmother used to call a group hug. But it was complex and shaded. He could get lost in it.
“Yes, there’s so much to explore,” Lina said. “This is how life could be, so rich.”
“I wish I was there,” he said.
“But you are,” she answered. “You are here, just not in the old way.”
He didn’t know what to think. Just then he felt Alton’s mind.
“We meet again,” Alton said.
“I never imagined it would be like this,” Raefe said.
“Yet you seem unhappy,” Alton said.
“No, I’m very happy. But when Lina connected, I was very frustrated. I’ve been trying to understand what you all are doing on a bigger scale, working out how we can understand how this will change things.”
“Lina told me about your project,” Alton said. “It sounds super cool. Can we help?”
“Maybe,” Raefe said. “I haven’t succeeded in accurately describing empathy in all its glories — what activates it, deactivates it, how it interacts with competitiveness. All of these things get complicated very fast, and I’m just stuck.”
“I could understand that,” Alton said. “I was one of the first people Lina reached out to when she came here. It was a very cool experience. But it wasn’t the same as the waveform. Once we we were all connected, many things became clearer. I think we can help you, if you try and describe your problem.”
“It’s pretty technical,” Raefe said. “Particles and fields and all that.”
“That is just the words you use to describe it. Quiet your mind and let us see what you know and what you want to know”
Time slipped away. Raefe was no longer aware of whether it was light or dark, whether he was sitting or standing. A 200-way conversation of thoughts flowed in and around him, all focused on deeply probing empathy and how it changed what we think, feel, and do. In a lull, he thought “of course, one person can’t understand all of this,” and then was swept up again in the waveform. It wasn’t like 200 people talking and certainly not 200 people arguing or debating. It was 200 people with a common purpose, growing organically from their own experience and needs. Their waveform seemed at times like an actual ocean wave, breaking over the long open sea, bits of the truth bobbing to the surface as it passed over the deeps. The bits became a loose assemblage floating on the current that grew and took on a shape. He watched, fascinated, as the shape refined itself, its facets and recesses increasingly well defined. Still, it pulsed and changed as each person’s thoughts molded it.
By morning, he understood what needed to be done. The latest iteration of the 100 year sim was nearly perfect in describing the world as he knew it. He disconnected from the waveform, exhausted and ecstatic. He sent Joe and Elise the address of the perfected sim and slept as deeply as he ever had.

            <Title>The fruit of the tree</Title>
            <Text>The fruit of the tree
Aleron was nervous and happy at the thought of a quiet dinner with Salmerikon. Her contact with Raefe and Lina had revealed immense progress for both of them. She hoped he would see this as the beginning of regaining their mission. Telling him would be a way to demonstrate that she had put her reservations about his behavior aside without him having to apologize or her having to admit she had been hasty in doubting his motives. If neither of them could claim the high ground, at least they could gaze toward it together as friends and colleagues.
She looked around her apartment and sent it an image of the space without the front wall, extending the floor out over the canyons below in a sort of patio. At the edges, she thought of a low curving wall with a spongey covering that the two of them could sit against and look at the sky. She realized she was thinking of the dinner in a romantic way and that she wasn’t even surprised. Anatope had been right, of course. She and Salmerikon had become a couple around the time she had taken the Earth assignment. But they had been casual about it. She had slowly explored him against the backdrop of her excitement about leading the Earth mission. And he had been willing to keep things that way.
Since the incident with Lina, their time together had been strictly work related. But she realized that she missed even their loose arrangement. Did he, she wondered. But her thoughts were interrupted with the sensation of Salmerikon approaching. He wanted to know if her balcony was still the way she had left it the last time he was there. She let him see the changes she had made, and he seemed pleased.
Half a minute later, she could see why. He had chosen to fly to her. She didn’t even know he had a flight suit. He swooped down and landed gracefully on the deck, his purple and green colors glistening through the tight mesh of his flight suit.
“Ah, what a glorious day!” he exclaimed. “I’ve been to the Rannikan Hills. This week, you can see our brother planets and the sun all at the same time from there.”
“It’s been forever since I did that,” she said. “Were the seven-fruit trees blooming?”
He smiled. “See for yourself.”
He pulled a sack from a pouch in the suit. There were two of each of the seven fruit. “I hoped you haven’t made dinner yet.”
“No,” she said. “And this will be much better than what I had been thinking of. I didn’t know you were a forager.”
“Now and then. Gliding over the Hills, scanning for food, it has a way of clearing the mind.”
She was delighted. Restaurants sometimes served the seven courses of fruit, but to have them fresh-picked during a full sky, the only time these trees produced all seven types of fruit, was a rare treat. She began to let him sense her gratitude, but realized a better way. She cooed the call that ancient females had used to signal their approval of mating displays.
Salmerikon laughed. “I haven’t heard that in hundreds of years.”
“I won’t ask what the last occasion was,” she said. “We should eat them in the ritual order that our ancestors did to thank B’Nonte and C’Noono for shining more of A’Mopto’s light, causing the trees to bloom and flower. And I’ve asked the kitchen to make some asterflower wine to go with them.”
“Excellent!”
They made small talk during the meal, not wanting to distract from the sublime and different flavors each fruit offered. They let each other sense their contentment. So they had survived their conflict over Lina. But how would things be different, she wondered.
“Thanks so much for bringing these,” she said when they had finished the last of them. “Very few people understand my love for unenhanced experiences.”
“Very few people have had them, I’m afraid,” he responded. “After thousands of years, our own people have grown to be dismissive of their ancestors. They discount them as foolish primitives. They think our progress has come through enhancements alone. And I’m afraid that is true throughout the Guardians of all species. Most of us have crossed a threshold where we are so intimately related  to each other that we are always empathetic. We would never revert to the violence of past eras. But we’ve come to credit our enhancements for that, not our entanglements, which we created originally without enhancements.”
“You have a wider view then me,” she said. “You interface with so many people on and off world. But I see what you say in my students. Recently, I let them experience a bit of life as Raefe does and that is just how they responded. I had to point out to them that their low opinion of humans was exactly the kind of thinking they accused the humans of. I hope I can help them elevate their shame into empathy. Ironically, the humans are just starting to do that themselves.”
She told him about Lina’s discovery of the Citizens of Nowhere.
“This band of refugees has already left behind the worst practices of their civilization without any help from us. They are all very close to being able to entangle. Lina’s presence alone may help them cross that line.” 
“You may be right,” Salmerikon said. “Strong entanglers can set off a cascade of further entanglement.”
“Hmm. So maybe if Raefe was with her, they’d have a more profound effect on those around them?”
“Yes, most likely. And vice versa — Raefe’s abilities still need further development. Being together, in a sympathetic environment, all of that raises the odds that they can ultimately initiate a durable waveform that other people can tune into. More and more will add to it, and if humans repeat the pattern of other species, within  a few centuries humans will have left behind the era when they could not really understand each other, and therefore, not really overcome their differences.  But that is still a long way off. What is he doing now?”
“He’s involved with a research project that’s trying to understand the relative role of competition and collaboration in human history. “
She explained the complicated commercial arrangements that had led to his assignment as best she could. Salmerikon seemed pleased at how things were going.
“Well, all things considered, they’re both in a much better place to have a significant influence,” he said. “All the more reason for us to not make too much noise in the council about what is going on.”
“So it’s come to that?” she asked.
“Yes, for the time being,” he answered. “I’m still trying to figure out what Hanakori’s end game is.”
The thought sobered her.
“I guess I can accept that we cannot be totally open,” Aleron said. “But it’s a new feeling for me. Our whole lives are nearly transparent — we share our very thoughts and feelings. Still I want to tell you that I did something with Raefe and Lina like what your did with her.”
“What do you mean?” he asked, a little alarmed.
“Raefe was sent a message that Lina had been kidnapped. He desperately wanted to contact her, but he has never initiated an entanglement with another human, let alone one on the other side of the planet. And she has never been entangled with another human either and barely knows how to use her newfound abilities. So I connected them — I advanced their development.”
“Well, I wouldn’t beat yourself up about it,” he said. “It was only a matter of a little time before they figured that out.”
“Yes, just what I thought,” she said. “But I feel like I have lost something here, some sense of order and rightness by violating our code.”
“If it makes you feel better, I feel the same. The truth is, we have lost exactly that.”
“So how are we different, let alone better, than Hankori, if we also break the rules?”
“We are not better,” he said. “The entire basis of our civilization and of the Guardians is just that. There is no ‘better’ among living creatures. There is, however, different. And that can only be measured in outcomes — what world do our actions make?”
“But that is why we have rules, isn’t it? Because we have experienced terrible outcomes brought on by certain actions, and so we say ‘never do that again.’”
“Yes, we do. We say that to children. And when they grow up, they discover that sometimes following the rule threatens also to lead to terrible outcomes. And then, they must weigh the consequences.”
“But I don’t know the consequences,” she said.
“Yes, with all of our technology, our accrued wisdom, our success at survival, we are still just people after all. We have to guess at things and do the best we can. There is no scientific reason to believe we will ever know the future before it happens.”
“Still, the whole business upset me. The humans have a saying,” she said. “’Rules are made to be broken.’Perhaps that is what they mean by it.”
“Your humans are not the barbarians Hankori would like the council to believe,” he said. “His experiences with them were as much about his own failings as theirs.”
“I wondered that, too,” she said. “Anatope told me that Hankori’s contacts turned out to be deeply flawed. How could he mistake sociopaths for empaths?”
“Because secretly he believes that our abilities and knowledge have transformed us into demi-gods. And he mistook the sense of apartness that sociopaths have for a sense of aboveness.”
She had no words for this. She let him sense her shock and horror, her confusion that one of the leaders of their society and of the Guardians was potentially himself a sociopath. After 10,000 years, how could this happen?
 “We are only people. This is the lesson of history and of the Guardians. We are imperfect organic machines, given to paradox and mistake. And the universe? It may obey the laws of physics, but those very laws yield all the chaos and violence of a supernova, not just the beauty of the sunset we are looking at now.”
Aleron said nothing. She leaned back against the spongey wall, wishing she could bottle the beauty of the many-colored light and use it to clean away some of the ugliness of life. She knew Salmerikon was watching her, feeling her unease.
“The light is comforting, isn’t it?” he said. “I feel that same need. Now you see the depth of my dilemma. Think of how shocked you are. You believe me because, well, for many reasons. But will the other Guardians? And our own society? Ultimately, I believe they will, and we will be able to undo the damage,” he said, his usual determination infused by a passion she had not heard from him before. “ But the coming years will test us. We must be skillful, on the one hand, and yet not let the conflict make us into what Hanakori has become.”
“Have you found other allies?” she wondered.
“Yes, but not as strong as you.”
She cleared her mind and looked at him. In that instant, she realized that he was telling her, as best he could, that he needed her. That he depended on her youth and her freshness. That these battles he had been waging in secret by himself had taken a toll on him.
“I am not as strong as you think I am,” she said. “Just as you depend on me to have the spirit and energy to carry on, I depend on you to have the insight and experience to know the way. But I will fly these currents with you, if that’s what you are asking.”
And, she thought, I see that he meant that but more, too. Not just to fly, but to nest. She responded, humming to encourage him. He stepped forward and his arms enveloped her, as the wings of his ancestors would have during courtship. She put her head against his chest and hummed the mating song.
He smiled. “What a lovely song you sing!”
She told the room to close the outside wall. Her bed, a modern abstraction of an ancient nest, extended from the inner wall and the lights brightened, as if the sun were shining on them. She shrugged off her clothes, letting all of her colors shine in the brightness, watching as he did the same.

            <Title>First Thunberg experience</Title>
            <Synopsis>Noreen takes them to Thunberg. Describe how it works, some of the main characters. At the head of the Grand Riviere, land is slightly higher.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Noreen came for them at dawn. Nila was already up, the events of the day before having shredded her ability to sleep. Mik would get payback today for his indulgences of the night before. Nila smiled at the memory. Sometimes Mik didn’t have to work too hard to remind her that he was  a year younger than her. Well, no one had gotten hurt, so that was a plus.
It hadn’t occurred to Nila that the way to Thunberg would be in a boat.
“Oh, yeah,” Noreen said. “Get used to it. Roads aren’t a big thing up here. We never had many, and now the ground’s so squishy that they’re hard to keep up. There used to be a road along the river all the way to where Thunberg is now, but after the thaw it just sank in the mud and there’s no money to fix it proper. There’s still a big road that goes along the edge of the bay, so trucks can move between the big ports. Inland, you just go up the rivers. But first we have to cross this lake.”
They headed across the a wide expanse of dull, flat water eastward until they reached Sakimi, a smaller version of Radisson where any of the dozens of settlements within a hundred miles came to get goods that had come up river from the Bay through Radisson. There they switched to a small motorized canoe and went east along the Grand Riviere, which wasn’t so grand at this point —  more of a channel in a vast marsh. Even then, it wasn’t like any swamp she had ever seen. No cattails or mangrove, just a giant mudflat pimpled by short tufts of grass. Noreen explained that by July it would be much drier and there would be more plants, but the flora still was dominated by plants that had spent eons in winter hibernation, only getting started around this time of year. The arctic ice had gone, but they still got huge snowstorms off the bay in the winter.
“If you had come a month ago, this would have all been white, as far as the eye can see,” Noreen said. “But you won’t see snow again here until November or December. And Thunberg’s too far inland — they don’t get that much snow at all anymore.”
For hours they traveled up the river, no sign of humans that they could see. The land was flat, the trees short but already green. Birds were everywhere, as were fish in the river. Occasionally, they saw small groups of deer. They talked very little. Noreen was focused on the water, navigating around hidden rocks and drowned trees. Mik was awestruck, never having seen anywhere so wild. Nila could feel it coming off of his mind. She touched it lightly, wondering if he could tangle with her. Now that she no longer needed to worry about the New Kendall Secs, she was eager to explore her abilities. Some part of Mik reacted to her, almost like a flinch. But he didn’t seem to be conscious of her probe at all. She let him be.
The sun was almost high in the sky now.
“It’s noon,” Noreen said. “We’ll stop for lunch.”
“Noon?” Mik said, surprised. “The sun is still pretty low.”
“Yeah, that’s what happens up here,” Noreen said. “We’re at 54 degrees, so it never gets high. In the summer, it wanders slowly on a long arc, but you’ll never see it straight up like you’re used to. You’ll be wearing those sunglasses most of the time outside — it’s just blinding in your eyes all the time otherwise.”
“We wanted something new,” Nila said. “I guess we got it, eh Mik?”
“Yeah, nothing like New Kendall, that’s for sure.”
“Well, don’t worry about it,” Noreen said. “The whole world is new now. We’re all still getting used to it. And by the time we do, it’ll have changed again.”
“I wish my mom understood that,” Nila said. “She’s bought into the whole corpo ‘we are an island of stability among the chaos’ bullshit.”
“More like an island of bullshit, anyway,” Mik said.
Noreen laughed. “Well, you can’t blame people for wanting stability, I guess. But islands, that’s another story. Islands come and islands go — you learn that first hand up here.”
“Where we’re from, too,” Nila said. “That’s part of why we’re here. We just didn’t want to be the people on the island, so to speak, firing guns at drowning people trying to come ashore.”
Noreen just nodded. Nila felt her sadness leak out slowly over the surrounding marsh. She could feel that Noreen had her own experiences with violence — she hadn’t just seen it on the net. They had found a small, dry hill to sit and eat. Away from the river sounds, she could hear more birds and crickets. Squirrels and chipmunks, the occasional rabbit — it wasn’t that different than home. Just no buildings in sight.
Lunch done, they continued up the river. The sides slowly narrowed, the banks got steeper. They were headed due east, into a light she had never seen. The air was absolutely transparent — this was some of the cleanest air on the planet. But the sun was already getting low in the west, and the eastern sky was grey. It felt like night, but you could see everything. There were low hills that grew increasingly large as they came closer. They were craggy but seemed only two-dimensional in the flat light.
Soon, the hills were no longer visible as the river grew narrower and the banks higher. The scrub along the banks turned into larger bushes, and then a sort of miniature birch forest, the trees rarely more than 10 feet high. Now and then they could see past the trees to the surrounding area. It was no longer an endless marsh. Noreen explained that the cold, which also brought dryness, and the many months of short daylight, kept the vegetation close to the ground.
“Except for vegetables,” she said. “Wait until you see the gardens later this summer. Tomatoes like you’ve never seen. Squash you could live inside. And, here we are.”
Suddenly, they rounded a bend and could see a settlement. Soon, they were there, clambering up on to the bank to a town like none they had ever seen. Some buildings were arranged like flower petals around a central tower. Others were built in a terraced manner, stair-stepping their way up six stories, an odd sight in the middle of the wilderness. The streets were wide, with a trolley track down the middle that had autonomous truck-like electric vehicles quietly traversing. On either side, people moved on everything from shoes to bikes fitted with small trailers.
“Here, we are, Thunberg,” Noreen said, waving toward the town. “Home to 6,000 adventurous souls.”
“Six thousand and two now, I guess,” Mik said. “Sure looks different than New Kendall.”
*****
Thunberg was everything Nila had hoped for and nothing like she had expected. It was not the edge-of-the-world, pioneers-in-tents image she had in her mind. Nor was it the techno marvel that everyone on the net made it out to be. It was, without doubt, the oddest place.
The basic concept of the town was two-fold. One, don’t make matters worse: don’t emit greenhouse gases, don’t pollute, don’t stress the flora or fauna. Two, make matters better: use the gases coming out of the freshly thawed tundra, and the carbon in the air, as raw materials in new ways that didn’t violate the first principle. The technologies employed ranged from ancient to state of the art. There were a bewildering array of processes and products that seemed to change constantly, adapting with the time of year, the time of day, the weather and a variety of other factors too numerous for Nila to get a handle on at first glance.
But the basic idea was simple. During the long summer days, solar cells charged up giant batteries. They also powered electrochemical processes that created basic chemical building blocks from CO2 in the air, methane leaking out of the ground, and various other substances. During the winter, wind power ruled. Some of the chemicals created during the summer were then consumed in fuel cells to create heat, but without emissions. The batteries also provided winter power. Some of the chemicals were combined with plant compounds like cellulose from small tree farms planted on the surrounding hills to create  materials — bricks and beams of various sizes — that were what most buildings were made of. These materials could be dissolved through electrochemistry back to their basic ingredients, eliminating any long-lasting harmful waste.
It was all like some giant science fair project, only it was real, and she had to admit, pretty cool. Most of the buildings also hosted plants all over them — some for food, some for creating fibers for cloth or rope or other useful items, some for medicine or other purposes. Little was wasted, nothing was harmful.
“You’ve got that look,” Noreen said. “Like you think it’s amazing but you wonder how it all works.”
“Yeah,” Nila said. “Exactly. More, does it all work?”
“Amazingly, it does,” Noreen said. “But not always how you’d like it.”
“What do you mean?” Mik asked.
“When winter comes, you’ll see for yourself,” Noreen said. “Adjustments will have to be made.”
Nila felt a brief surge of emotion from her, but she couldn’t put a name to it. Darkness, difficulty, a huddling feeling. 
“That’s us, right, Mik?” Nila said. “We’re here to make adjustments. Can’t go on the old way.”
He looked even younger than he was as he tried to take on board just what they had gotten themselves into, just managing a half grin.

Later, Des gets deep into the Daimler Siemens system and he discovers the Armageddon plan. It’s all going to be triggered by computer, so this gives them a way to stop it.
Raefe and Lina convene their summit. They had been focused on the environment and slowly building up man’s empathic abilities but now its clear that the elites won’t give them that luxury of time. They all agree to sabotage the plan by hacking it and then fully publicizing it.</Notes>

            <Title>First day of class</Title>
            <Synopsis>Salmerikon explains the origin of the Guardians</Synopsis>
            <Text>Salmerikon watched the last sun fade under the horizon, night leaving only a pale glow on the farthest moon. Far below his ledge, the waters rippled with the breeze, dappling the two moons’ dim reflection. He stood still for a long time, letting his thoughts settle. A lot was on the line tonight.
Something distracted him and he became aware of a flyer perched on a nearby rock, staring at him. Even after a million years of evolutionary divergence, he could understand the look of his distant cousin – she was curious why he was standing, alone, unaware, open to the night. And night  had fully come while he stood thinking. The glowing river of the galaxy’s center now striped the sky above him. Curiosity, it was what had led his kind to these moments.
In a little while, he would reach out with only his enhanced mind and meet hundreds of similar minds across 20 worlds and even more species in that great river. All because a billion years ago, on one of those worlds, someone had been curious about quantum entanglement, a puzzle that had stumped many civilizations. Not so Naw’Ra, who had first grasped that entanglement proved the long-theorized existence of extra-dimensional strings that connected the most fundamental particles of existence. Against all odds, she had proven that the universe was a network of connections that had existed since the big bang. Later searchers would finish her theory, describing the universe as ultimately nothing more than than the broken symmetry of the singularity that had arisen from the vacuum, itself the remnants of the heat death of a truly ancient universe from unknowable trillions of years before. But it was Naw’Ra who had learned to harness the hidden fabric of the universe, and in doing so, change history.
Salmerikon turned and entered the cave behind him. Tonight, event his simple apartment would be too full of distractions. He needed total concentration, and the small, remote cave, bare but for a mirror on the far wall, would give him that. He would have to inspire these cadets to change history, or history would eventually wipe out the achievements of Naw’Ra and the many generations of her followers.
He made himself comfortable, and let his mind open. His thoughts merged with the wormhole interface and found the first tendrils of other consciousness. Slowly, he knitted together hundreds of these tendrils, causing them to align and beat like waters lapping the foot of the cliff below.  
“Cadets! Welcome to the waveform.” He let them look through his eyes at the cave, feel the air on the tiny vestigial feathers that gave his papery brown head deep purple and red hues. He turned toward the mirror at the far end of the cave so that they could see what he looked like. He felt the waveform relax as he became known to everyone.
“Now we take the first step in your transformation to become Guardians. While you all have practiced this among your own species, on your own worlds, you are now entangled with hundreds of beings from other species in the galaxy. Some of you are over 100 light years from each other, yet we can communicate as if in the same room. This is the first gift of guardianship –– to be able to bridge space and time and share your thoughts and feelings with others.
“You have taken the step to enlist as cadets. You have passed the first reviews and exams, so relax, there will be no test tonight. I do want to ask a question though: What is the purpose of being a Guardian?”
“To save emerging civilizations from self-destruction,” a tall, reedy biped answered.
“To ensure that civilizations that survive do not become threats to other species,” a globular marine creature said. 
“I can feel that most of you agree with these statements,” Salmerikon said. “And they are not wrong, But how is it that we can hope to do either of these things, so far from the worlds we affect, only a few thousand Guardians scattered among all of our worlds, where our fellow beings go about their life unconcerned with our work?”
No one answered.
“Ultimately, our work is to connect,” Salmerikon said. “To find those, like Naw’Ra, in whom the gift of connection is naturally strong, and to teach them the power of connection. So that they in turn, can connect, not just in the way we are now, but in many profound ways, with their own species. So that their own species can become more deeply interconnected.”
“Most species who destroy themselves already have advanced communications and are more connected than they have ever been,” a cadet answered, her skepticism evident. “How does increasing that connection change things?”
“That, my young flyer, is precisely what you are here to learn. For now, I will point out that anywhere that life has moved beyond the most basic forms, connection is a profound part of evolution. Right now, for example, we are working with a promising species called the People. On their planet, two billion years ago, two kinds of cells — one that make energy from light, and one that  could harness that energy to create many basic compounds, connected and fused and set off an explosion of autotrophic life that has lasted until this moment.”
“But that was blind connection,” protested the young flyer. “No intelligence was involved.”
“You are right, I only wanted to make that point that connection is a basic and under-appreciated aspect of even the most basic life. To your point, though, as life becomes sentient, it organizes itself into a variety of connections. How many of you live in a society where you are not born into any larger unit — no family, clan, tribe, nation, no connection to anyone outside yourself?”
“No one, of course,” Salmerikon continued. “But how many of you come from a world where your history was not filled with conflict between individuals, families, clans, tribes and so on?”
“None of you. And it was only when your ancestors, some of them helped by the Guardians, came to understand that connection was more important than conflict that you began to advance. Actually, it was only when your ancestors understood that it was not just the recent connection of family or tribe or nation, but the myriad of connections underlying life itself that were fundamental, that you made progress.”
“Connection is the foundation of all existence, of all life, and as a Guardian, you will experience it as deeply as anyone has, as far as we know, at least in this galaxy. So we will begin with our beginnings, a story you may have heard pieces of, or some not-quite-right version of. Please open your minds fully, and let us go back almost a billion years to the time of the first Guardians, who called themselves the Maw’u’I, the Explorers.
“The Explorers lived in a system with 6 habitable worlds and more than 20 habitable moons, but complex life had arisen on only their world. They were not unlike many of us. They had limbs — six in their case — spoken language, and had been toolmakers for many generations, gradually evolving more and more sophisticated technology. Like most of us, they had arrived at a point where they could destroy their environment, blow themselves up, or find a way forward.”
He let them see U Maw, the Explorer homeworld. Many islands, some so big it would take weeks to walk across, dotted a water sea, like so many living worlds. He took them directly to the middle of the last great battle for U Maw. They watched as one of the larger islands was consumed by the terror of battle. They watched as the tall, slender, goldish green Maw’u’’ins traded laser canon fire and sonic canon blasts. Lightning sprung from airships, illuminating the faces of the soldiers. He showed them how the carnage went on for days, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage, each side sustaining huge losses. He let them see a satellite view, and they could see smoke clouds filling the atmosphere almost everywhere there was land. They understood that the Maw’’u’I world was divided into three great alliances, known as Houses, and that they had been locked in mutual combat for many lifetimes.
“It was a war of all against all,” Salmerikon injected into the vision. “So often, life comes to this. But the Maw’u’I were lucky. For just before this great war, they had begun exploration of their star system and realized that the other habitable worlds were rich in resources. Life had started on several worlds, but had been largely erased by bad luck, most likely a gamma ray burst from a star 6 light years away that had killed off all but the simplest life on all the planets except U Maw. Their world had simply been out of the line of sight of the burst, so they were spared. But here they were, on the verge of self-induced extinction.”
“Ending the ceaseless war was only just the beginning,” Salmerikon said, drawing the tale to a close. “Naw’Ra remained true to her vision of second chances for life, for intelligence. The schools she founded made deep studies of how intelligence arises in relation to competition and collaboration, how species on one planet can coexist, and many other important questions that had to be answered to prevent a repeat of their history. In the billion years since, we have learned so much about that dance, which every sentient species that is at all social must perform.”
“Are you saying that the Explorers were the first race to survive destroying their own planet and successfully colonizing others,” asked one of the marine species.
“No, not at all. Many species had done that, only to destroy their new planets in time. No, the Maw’u’I were the first to advance down a different road. Their ability to experience deeply each other’s minds led them to understand how important that was. They understood that since they had advanced socially from primitive beings, the balance between what they knew about the world and what they knew about each other had changed radically. They knew so much about transforming the physical world, and so little about how they themselves were being changed by these transformations.”
“They had built great cities and filled them, but had only a passing awareness of what it means to take animals that evolved to live in small bands and put them in a herd of 10 million, all fighting for survival. Now able to truly read each other’s minds, they were shocked to see clearly how distorted and scarred their minds had become. We will delve much more into this later. 
“For now,  it’s enough to understand that the Maw’u’I began a 10,000 year intellectual and emotional trek along a this dual path. They probed deeply into themselves, but also into the nature of space and time. How could they meet life from other worlds? How could they ensure that those lifeforms were enlightened enough to not be a threat? This drove two key discoveries. First, they discovered how to entangle across wormholes. This allowed them to transfer their thoughts across light years instantly. 
“For a 1,000 years, this brought them more sadness than joy. They connected with more than a dozen other lifeforms in the galaxy that were sufficiently advanced to receive their communications. But in each case, they were just approaching, just at, or just after the same collision that the Maw’u’’i had been at in the time of Naw’Ra. 
“Following her spirit, they looked for another way, and they spent millennia probing what quantum uncertainty really meant. And they made their second great discovery. They learned how to probe other timelines and how to transfer energy through wormholes and entanglement. And now, they could create the Guardians.
“Three hundred years ago, I was a cadet. Like you, I had many questions. What would it feel like to find a new species of intelligent life, to find individuals who had the potential of a Naw’Ra to redirect their species away from ancient and now dangerous directions? How could I watch them fail and would I find the strength to transfer what advances in consciousness they had made to their parallel self in a more favorable timeline? And to watch them fail again, and to persist, with the patience of the Maw’u’I, until they succeeded? What kind of life would this be?””
He paused, life a flyer who has reached his aerie, happy but tired, his breath deep and long. He could feel the cadets anxiety, but also their anticipation. It was a good start.
“It is a life of the greatest joy, and I welcome you to it.”</Text>

            <Text>Prelude to a storm
November 14, 2048
It was Saturday and Raefe was, for once, not going to bother with work. The Titan Towers sim could wait until Monday. Cleaning his apartment could wait until tomorrow. His MiniWorlds pay had just been deposited and he was full up on credits. The cool rains of November had ceased, for once, and he was going to enjoy the day.
He clicked his Voice on.
“Manny, Raefe. Are you around?”
A second later, Manny clicked in.
“What’s up Raefe?”
“Got a chip full of credits, a nice day, and no work. What’s up with you?”
“The same. Me and Raquel are going to the club tonight, but I’m free until then. You’re welcome to come later, too, if you want.”
“I’ll probably pass on that. I thought maybe things were going to get in motion with someone at work, but turns out she’s in a girl phase right now. And I’m not in the mood for working the crowd at the club.”
“I hear you. Well, we got the whole afternoon. You want to meet up on the Harbor Trail?”
“Cool. Say 1?”
“Yeah, Castle Island at 1.”
He clicked the call off and got stuff together for the bike ride down to Castle Island. Hopping on his bike, he avoided looking left at the MinWorlds building next store. He didn’t even want to see it today. Monday he’d go back to being a grunt. Today was his.
He tooled out through TechTown and into North Point, then over the bridge into Boston, picking up the river trail. A few minutes later, he was pedaling at full speed, feeling the ocean breeze as it started to filter into the city. He loved this little stretch of trail. It was usually pretty empty and he could ride fast, the wind in his face. And then up a little hill and down and there was the whole harbor, out in front of him. 
He barely remembered the view before the trail had been built. In ‘31, a little before his third birthday, the long-predicted rising seas had finally hit Boston, flooding everything along the waterfront. In typical fashion, the city had none nothing about it, despite a number of lesser repeats. But in the aftermath of the economic crash six years later, some smart person had made sure that all property on the waterfront — now an economic disaster of its own — was bought up, leveled and turned into a sort of levee to protect against future storms. The crest of the levee was a flat, winding strip about 50 meters wide, with a bike trail running down the center.
It was a typical early November day, low ‘60s and breezy. Another month and it would be four months of slush. He wound his way along the trail, the sun shining off the water.</Text>

            <Text>In case of emergency
August 3, 2049
She could see that Raefe had been working on all night, tinkering with the empathy vectors. Joe had given him a sandbox space on the server farm to run a scaled down sim. He had been running recent history, starting with WWIII in 1951. The sim sometimes showed WWIV, in various years. Other times it showed increasing prosperity and peace. Nothing made any sense.
He and Lina had made so much progress in Africa. They were beginning to grasp the cycle of stress-induced evolution pushing their species toward greater interdependence. For 10,000 years, humans had been living in larger and larger groups. They had used their culture to balance the antagonisms their competitive sides experienced. Now they were nearing another nexus of this struggle, and they would have turn all their bodies had learned through 10,000 years of close quarters into new abilities, new ways of thinking and feeling. Just as her species had, and many before it.
The humans had a saying: if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Like all species in the optimization phase, they had a very big and powerful hammer — rationality. They had to discover that some nails were actually screws, and grasp what that meant.
“You are working so hard on this,” she said. “But you are not happy with the results.”
“If I can’t get the sim to play back something close to what’s already happened, what use is it in helping to understand what can make a difference in the future?”
“Not much,” she agreed. “Maybe you need to look at the problem differently.”
“You remind me of my 11th grade math teacher, always giving hints. I’d rather just know the answer.”
“This is not 11th grade mathematics,” she said sternly, although she actually had no idea what that meant. “You want to understand why 9 billion people who spoke thousands of languages and lived in hundreds of countries did what they did for four or five generations. You must go deeper.”
“Deeper where?”
“Everywhere. You are disappointed that you put empathy in your sim and it doesn’t tell you the future. What is empathy, anyway?”
“The ability to understand other people’s…Oh, you mean, what is it made of?”
“Yes! If I asked you what iron is, you wouldn’t say a hard metal. You’d say a substance made of protons, neutrons, and electrons that work together in this way, and so on.”
“So, what are the atomic elements of empathy?” he asked.
“What are the two fundamental things in the universe?” she said. He had come to expect her elliptical responses to direct questions about things he was clueless about.
“Matter and energy?” he said, thinking, food and sex, and I haven’t had one for hours and they other for weeks.
“Exactly! And how do they interact?”
“Through force fields, exchanged by particles?”
“That’s what Joe needs from you, that sort of analytic model. Obviously, there are not really particles of empathy. But how do humans experience empathy? How do they express it? Suppress it? What do they exchange, and what forces do those exchanges carry with them?”
“And here I thought you were going to tell me that the answer is 54.”
“I think you are, as you say, pulling my leg.”
“Massively. Really, you’ve given me a lot to think about.”
“I have confidence you will make progress. But I have to tell you some news.”
“Good, I hope.”
“Well, maybe your sim can tell you,” she laughed. She enjoyed the mental game humans called humor. “I have some things going on in my life that may affect when I’m available.”
“What’s going on with you?” he asked. She had never discussed her own life with him.
“I’m going to be a mother,” she said. “There may be times when I cannot entangle with you. I will train one of the other Guardians, Adno, to recognize you in the waveform. Perhaps you will entangle briefly, perhaps not. This is all new to me.”
“So you’re having a baby,” he asked, incredulous.
“Why is that so hard to believe?” she asked.
“I thought you were hundreds of years old and lived forever,” he said. “I figured you made replacements in a lab or something.”
“Evolution is its own laboratory. Many species think they can do better, but it turns out the best they can do is make minor improvements. Yes, I am 408 years old, but I will live about 2,000 years. I’m just a teenager, in your world. And we do have to reproduce, but not often. I will explain our lifecycle to you someday — it’s not exactly like yours.”
“So if I need you, and you don’t respond, I should snap my fingers and think ‘Adno?’”
“Yes, that will do. She will respond even if you don’t snap your fingers.”
“Cool. I’ll let Lina know. You said you had ‘things’ going on in your life. Is there more?”
She hesitated. She had wanted to tell him about the difficulties she and Salmerikon were up against. But he couldn’t help and it would only scare him.
“No, that was it. Just wanted to make sure we keep our connections strong.”

            <Text>Out for a walk
April, 2020

“Hey, old man, want to go for a walk?”
Raefe laughed. Tosh always liked to tease him. Sometimes people looked sideways at him for it, but Raefe appreciated it, actually. Took the Saint Raefe pressure off him.
“Sure. Where did you have in mind?”
“I heard New Kendall made their first delivery to the bus yard. I was thinking of walking up there, no bikes.”
So they went up Mass Ave. Spring had arrived full on, the leaves now hiding some of the crumbling buildings. In the winter, it could look mighty grim — acres of decay. Now at least there was the perennial carnival of green to interrupt that.
“Do you think the trees are laughing at us?” Tosh asked. “Being a tree here is a pretty good deal, eh? No more cruel winters.”
“Yeah, but they hate the storms,” Raefe countered.
“You can tangle with them?” Tosh kidded him.
“You can’t?” Raefe replied, giving it right back.
“The son of Alton Winchester, master of sustainable agriculture? Are you kidding? When I was small, sometimes I had to ask the plants to let my dad know I was around.”
Raefe smiled. “He’d be proud of you, that I know. He was a good man. If anyone had been able to tangle with plants, it would have been him. I don’t know if Everywhere would have happened without him.”
Raefe could feel Tosh’s unspoken thought: it was a lot to live up to. And he had, when Raefe thought about it.
“And I don’t know where Cambridge would be without you, Tosh. You’ve become such a force for good in the community.”
Tosh said nothing, but he smiled, and Raefe could feel that he took the compliment. They had arrived at the bus yard. Raefe saw Pedro and waved. He was standing next to a large collection of pallets, loaded down with all sorts of stuff. From a distance it looked like a junkyard on skids.
“Well, I got to hand it to you,” Pedro said. “The New Kendall crowd did actually deliver.”
“Anything useful?” Tosh asked.
“Oh, yeah,” Pedro said. “Might not look it, but we made sure. Right here is a lot of building materials — brick, some wood, some metal roofing. On the other side, there’s actually some furniture. Chairs, tables, stuff like that.”
“What can you do with it?” Raefe asked Pedro.
“We can build some shelters, repair some houses. Maybe enough for 200 people.”
“That’s great,” Raefe said. “Could you use more?”
“Absolutely,” Pedro said. “Hit me with another load like this, I’d say.”
“It’s in their interest, too,” Tosh said. “Keeps us on this side of the river longer. I’ll put the word out. They’re still tearing down in Boston, so they’ll have more. Three months good?”
“Yeah, take us that long to deal with this load.”
Raefe could feel Pedro was feeling good about it, no longer consumed by thoughts of hitting back. Not that far from the surface, though, so he and Tosh would have to try hard to keep things going.
“Hey,” Pedro said. “Ines wanted me to give you this. Somebody found it down near the Mass Ave bridge a couple of weeks ago. Seems like a kid over in New Kendall threw it over the river.”
Raefe took a bottle from him. Inside was a letter. He unfolded it and read it, Tosh looking over his shoulder.
To the people south of the river:
I want to tell you how sorry some of us up here are about the people that got killed in the flood. I was there and I saw it go down. They made us kids in high school be lookouts at the checkpoints. We saw the Secs shooting. It was horrible and wrong! You should just know that we don’t all hate you. The people who run this town are sick and I’m sick of them. I’m leaving and other young people are too. I wish I could help more, but I don’t know how. I’ve decided to go to one of the model farms in Canada. Maybe they have the right idea — make a world everyone can live in. Maybe that can make up for what happened here. We have to make a better future!Yours,
Sad, frustrated, angry but hopeful
“Thanks,” Raefe said. “I want to smile and cry at the same time.”
“Yeah, lot of that going around,” Pedro said. “But Ines wanted you to see it. And she won’t say it, but I will: you were right about not killing them. And she knows that now. She probably knew it then but didn’t want to admit it.”
And Pedro turned and went back to unloading the pallets. Raefe knew that had cost Pedro something and just said “Good luck with this. See you around.”
He and Tosh walked back down to Porter Square, enjoying the trees, the walk, and their small victory. It occurred to Raefe that Tosh probably had already known about the bottle and that Pedro was placated by the deliveries but had let Raefe find it out first hand to cheer him up. Who’s leading who now, he smiled to himself. 
As they walked he thought of the young woman who had reached out to him that day in New Kendall. Was she who had written the letter? Offhand, he couldn’t sense her. Had she already gone to Canada? And where? There were so many places where people were settling the newly warm tundra up there. Would it live up to her hopes?
“So many young people are drawn to these experiments,” Tosh said, reading him. “It’s their generation’s chance, I think. To get out of this mess, to have a fresh start, with a clean slate.”
“How much do you know about these farms?” Raefe asked.
“Not too much,” Tosh said. “They keep a low profile. They’re not even all farms, really. Some do aquaculture. Some do radical chemical engineering, even. Instead of mining or drilling for oil, like in the old days, they turn carbon dioxide or methane into building materials, or fuel cells. Drawing down greenhouse gases, locking them into useful stuff using solar energy. Nothing new there, but they specialize in doing it on a small scale, with cheap and dirty materials.”
“Like your dad,” Raefe said. “He was the one who got everyone started on that.”
“For sure,” Tosh said. “But he didn’t know you could do it without plants, just engineering bacteria. Even with all the chaos, little groups of scientists kept at it and then they went off the grid with it after 2082. They didn’t trust their corporate sponsors anymore — after all, another Billy Warren was sure to come along. And Robertson survived the whole thing, obviously. They went rogue and now there’s this whole subculture of sustainable biohackers.”
“Which a lot of people are still suspicious of,” Raefe said.
“For good reason,” Tosh said. “Don’t mess with Mother Nature and all of that. But this crowd is different. They look deeply into how the natural world works. They go slow and they don’t care about profit. And when they screw up, they change course.”
I bet Des knows all about this, Raefe thought to himself. My engineering genius son — how did that happen? He realized he didn’t even know what it was that Des was up to at the moment. He’d have to investigate.
When they got back to Porter Square, he begged off the rest of the day and went home. The walk had left him tired and that was a good excuse to leave. He had other things on his mind and he wanted to find Lina before she went to sleep. He climbed the stairs of his apartment building to the roof. He liked to come up here at nights to watch the stars some nights. Since city had shrunk, it had also gotten darker and when the moon was absent, you could almost see the Milky Way. Sometimes he liked to imagine that he could see Traveller’s Perch. But today it was a nice spring afternoon, already warming into the 70s with a gentle breeze. It seemed he couldn’t get enough of the trees today. From six stories up, much of surrounding land was hidden by the blooming canopy. It wasn’t the forest, but at least he couldn’t see all the daily reminders of how far the city had fallen.
He calmed himself and let Lina find him.
“Hello, my love. Have I caught you at a good time?” he asked.
“Of course,” she said. “The night is just coming on. And how are you, my love?”
“Good, I think. New Kendall made good on their promises, some of their youth are rebelling and leaving, and the Norcambs have decided maybe it was right to turn away from revenge.”
“That is good to hear. You really sounded up against it a couple of weeks ago. Are you feeling more settled now?”
“Well, I think I’m feeling clearer. Maybe not more settled. Maybe that was my problem, Lina.”
“How so?”
“How can we be ‘settled’ in this world? It is constantly changing — the weather, the sea, the rivers, the plants — and it will keep changing for many generations. I wanted to be settled, I wanted to rest. But I don’t think it is to be.”
“Oh, Raefe, you are 71. It is OK to rest. You are not the last person alive.”
“No, you are right. And I was realizing that today. I was realizing that Tosh has grown into a middle-aged man of great insight and skill. He has become a leader, at least here. People see me as the leader and him as the helper, but I think the truth is the other way around. I bless his ideas and people listen. But I see that he also can persuade, that his empathic skills have blossomed, and that he is ready to take over my role, at least here.”
“Yes, it’s a comfort to see the next generation bloom. But I sense there is more on your mind.”
“Indeed. A kid from New Kendall left a note for the Norcambs. They wanted to apologize for the shootings. They were there, apparently, and were horrified. And then they said something that really made an impression on me. It was I’ve decided to go to one of the model farms in Canada. Maybe they have the right idea — make a world everyone can live in. And then We have to make a better future.”
“Well, that is hopeful. Too bad they left.”
“Yes, I thought that, too. But then it struck me, no, good that they left. Because they left to do something, to be somewhere where they could change things. Like we had to go to Dadaab, they had to go north.”
“Do you know them?”
“Maybe,” he said and told her about the girl, Nila, he had tangled with in New Kendall. “I will try to find her in the waveform and encourage her. And thank her — the note changed minds in Norcamb.”
“That’s great.”
“But that’s not enough. You know why I’m stuck?”
“I think you are going to tell me.”
“Because I’ve stuck myself on this patch of land because it once was my home and I’ve been staring it down now for years, daring it to live up to my hopes. And that was unreasonable. The people here have their own struggles and they will find their way in time, but in their time. You know, I heard from our friend from far away.”
“No! The birds or the fish?”
He smiled. She always thought of them that way. “The bird from Mars. And she said something truly wise, as is their way. That our lives are so short. Do you know her partner is 1,200 years old? She says that she didn’t understand how much that shapes us, that we can never expect to see the fruits of our efforts fully realized. I don’t mean you and me, I mean all people. It’s just who we are.”
“How strange after all these years! But I could have told you that we are only mortal.”
“No, no, I know that. But it made me realize that my dream of a wave of empaths changing the world is a long-term dream. Not even Mari or Des will see it or even the generation after them. And I stuck myself here as if I couldn’t leave for a minute or I might miss the wave. And now rebel kids from all over are building new lives in new places and tangling is just a small part of it. What we set in motion will live long after us.”
“And that is great, is it not?”
“Yes, it’s fantastic. It’s the answer, or the beginnings of one. Or many answers. I don’t know. But I want to find out.”
“Ah, that’s what I was sensing. You are going to go walkabout, aren’t you?”
“Well, now that you say it, yes. I’m going to see for myself some of these experiments, these fresh ideas. And just so you don’t think I’ve completely lost it, I think you’ll agree that we always find that when people pull together and can realize these sorts of projects, their empathy also blooms. So I can look and learn, but I can also teach them about tangling, if they don’t already know.”
“I agree. I’m so happy that you’ve decided this. You know we’ll all support you however you need it. If you want, I’ll come join you. I’ve my own Toshes over here who are also ready if the old lady would just get out of the way.”
“That would be wonderful. But let me spend a few months exploring. When I find a place that makes sense, you can sail over and we can be together again. Or if not, we’ll wander together. But I need to walk on my own for just a bit.”
“Well, take good shoes,” she said, and he could feel her laughter. It had been awhile.
“Are the stars out yet?” he asked.
“No, not just yet,” she said. “Later, I will blow a kiss to your far off friend when I see her home.”
“And now I do that for you, my love. I will find you soon. Be well until then.”
He was excited, he realized. For the first time in a long time, he would be doing something new, something promising. He started making a mental list of all the things he needed to do, the people that he needed to talk to, before setting off. And then he had a thought. He reached out into the waveform and found her.
“I just wanted you to know,” he said, “that I’m going to be gone for awhile. Maybe it was our little talk, maybe it was some of the things going on here. But I’m going to try something new.”
“That sounds like good news,” Diver said. “What will you do?”
“I want to find young people who may not be walking my path, but are already building a new kind of world. I’m sure you know that here on Earth, the northern latitudes have been cold and barely settled for thousands of years. And now in some places the climate is quite moderate, the permanent snow and ice gone, and huge tracts of fertile land are exposed. Young people who have flocked to these areas, building new kinds of farms, factories, houses and so on. I want to meet them and learn from them.”
“What do you hope will happen?”
“I don’t know, but I think I’ve just been stuck here, banging my head against a wall. I’ve alway known that empathy alone would not change the world. But in the beginning, I was so worried that the climate crisis would  lead us to tear ourselves apart and that empathy would at least stop that. And I think it did, to a degree. But now we must also think about what’s next. Maybe things don’t move in simple straight lines. I feel deep down that these kids are doing something important. And that maybe it’s people like that who will be the carriers of empathy now.”
“You’ve had so many attempts like that — Everywhere, of course, but also all those groups that came to Dadaab.”
“Yes, and the ones that actually built communities — Dadaab, the Rising Tide, there were others — they’re still here and they’ve had an impact. So I think that maybe empathy can’t just rest at understanding. It has to be transformative, not just of our hearts and souls, but of the physical world, too. Otherwise, it all just gets worn down by the usual frictions.”
“I admit, I am surprised. You seemed exhausted. And now you want to make this journey.”
“I surprise myself, to be honest. Maybe I’m just a foolish old man. But I’m not going to sit around here for the next 10 or 20 years until I die, whining about how little effect I’m having or pining for the old days with the Urban Gypsies. It’s time to admit that the torch has been passed, and to see what light it brings.”
They talked for awhile longer, Diver remembering that she still knew very little about humans, Raefe wanting her to feel that she was not wrong to help them. The years had put distance between them, but now he was remembering her strength and wisdom and how good it felt to have her on his side. On humanity’s side, really.

            <Synopsis>Raefe and Linda take the subway home to Somerville. She suggests they go to Miami. He thinks about it, agrees.
K&amp;K introduced</Synopsis>
            <Text>October, 2049

“What do you think?”
Raefe turned away from the subway window. They were underground anyway, nothing to see.
“What do I think about what?” he replied, turning toward Lina.
“About us going to Miami Sea Islands for winter break. Have you been listening at all?”
No, he thought, not at all, I was daydreaming. We were in the middle of giant firestorms, running for our lives.
“Sorry, I must have dozed off. You know how I am on the subway.”
“I do. Now that I have your attention, what do you think?”
He thought that Miami was a full day’s journey on the solar train, through some areas where the United States of America was mostly a memory. Through miles of ruined coast, and snow season coming soon.
“Maybe. I haven’t been there since the seawall broke. Wouldn’t it be depressing?”
“I hear it’s actually cool – you can swim along all these old hotels, all kinds of fish come in and out. It’s like those coral reefs you see in old movies from the vidstream archives.”
“I don’t know, let me think about it.”
Lina was used to his indecision. “You’re having those dreams again? Just when you dozed off now?”
“Yeah. Surprised me. Usually only happens after I’ve been asleep for a while.”
She began the “shouldn’t you get some help for it” conversation for the nth time and he forced himself to smile and look away. He had never told her about the hours of therapy, the drugs, the deep brain stimulation cap he had worn for months, all the rest that his parents had dragged him to in his adolescence. 
Fortunately, his parents didn’t like coming to East Somerville — they had grown up in sketchy neighborhoods and didn’t like to be reminded. Out of sight, they couldn’t exercise their irrational belief in the power of psychopharmaconeurology on him from afar. PPN could get out of control and he tried hard to avoid it. He knew they were just dreams, even if they were frightening and often ruined his ability to sleep. They came and went, and when they went, he got all the sleep he could.
The train glided to a stop in TechTown, with it’s 40-story glass towers towering over  Cambridge. Several heads jerked upright, their Voices telling them through their fashionably invisible tiny ear implants that it was time to wake the frick up and get off the sooty train and head home to their fancy little condos. Shiny little office nerds, nervously tapping their eyeglass puters on. Must check those messages, wouldn’t want to have to look at all the grimey losers on the train.
Some of his friends longed to work in TechTown after graduation. Not for Raefe. Sleep on the 11th floor, work on the 17th floor, exercise in the basement, parties on the roof, you were basically a well-kept serf. Your company crashes, not only do you loose your job, you have to move. All for the promise of “earning a spot among the best and brightest.” Or at least the most impressed with themselves. No thanks, there had to be a life that was better than that. If only he knew what it was.
Finally, they reached Union Square. Kiko and Kayam's Deli trike was out  and Lina won’t walk by without stopping for Kayam’s Cairo Cubano. Plus, K&amp;K were human message boards for the fugees that flowed in and through Somerville.
“What’s shaking, Lina,” Kayam said. “What you hear from East Africa?”
“As little as possible, Kayam,” she replied. “I’ve got all the memories I can stand from that place.”
“I hear you. I haven’t heard from my cousin in a while, though, and I’m  getting worried.”
“Well, it ain’t getting better. Last time I faced with my folks on the net, they said word in South Africa is the pirate gangs are banding together and giving the Chinese big trouble.”
“If I know my cousin, he’s in the middle of that.” Kayam shakes his head as if his cousin was already in jail or worse. “That’s the thing in Efricar — you either be a stooge for the Chinese or fall in with the local crazies. Seems like that’s the only choice they get.”
“Well, if he can get himself down to Sofricar, maybe my folks can hook him up,” Lina says, but she knows his cousin is from a little village and barely even knows where Sofricar is.
Neither Kim nor Raefe has ever been to Efricar, but Kiko knows the whole fugee diaspora scene all too well. Her family fled Yokohama after Emperor Kim VI sent hundreds of drones filled with radioactive waste all over the city. Many hit ships in the harbor filled with export goods, which cratered the economy. There was no welcome for her family elsewhere in Japan, so here she is in East Somerville. Raefe’s the odd man out. Six generations ago, his family was like hers, refugees from Czarist Russia and all its pogroms and unrest. But they’ve lived within 150 miles of here for six generations.
“Stay warm!” Raefe said. They walked down toward the old highway, his arm around Lina, her ‘froish hair scratching his nose. He inhaled the scent of her skin mixed with coffee and dark sugar. She could be fierce, but he felt like they had each put tendrils out toward each other in the last year, and they had begun to mesh. It was a new feeling and he liked it.
The last rays of the sun glint off the harbor, just pass their little overpass. In ‘41, the big Arctic ice sheet disaster that sent tidal waves into Miami also pushed the Mystic River far into East Somerville. The waters stopped about 50 yards from a small section of elevated highway that was underwater except for this section.
“Seeing that sunset past the bridge always reminds me of when we met,” Raefe said.
“Did we meet?” she  shot back. “I seem to remember I was just standing over there and you were busy looking at my ass.”
He blushed. “You’re not going to let me forget that. I wasn’t actually looking at your ass, anyway.”
They’d been working all day on project to reclaim the neighborhood after the flood, and Raefe was exhausted. He was trying to push a cart overloaded with building materials, but it was rough going across the cracked terrain of the broken asphalt. Before he knew it, Lina had leaned in to the front handle of the cart. As she pushed her shirt rode up a bit and he could see the muscles ripple in the small of her back, and she just seemed to be bursting with life. In the sunset light, she glowed  a honey color that took his breath away.
“Uh huh,” she smiled. “Anyway, I almost fell out laughing when I turned around. You had that look guys get when they check out girls and get caught. Like you thought you had one more second to cross the street before the train hit you and you just realized that big light in front of the train was shining right on you.”
He remembered her chuckling more than laughing, and he was more awestruck than embarrassed. The next day they wound up working together on the project, and when it was finished three months later, they’d already coupled up. So when Somerville gave preference to the reclaim workers for some of the housing units, they put in for the lottery and here they were, unlocking their own Tiny under the old overpass.
Raefe remembered their conversation on the train.  “Do we have enough carbon credits to go to Miami without paying a fine?”
“Yes! And if we spend one day helping to build the tidal power generation station, we can not only get some of them back, but get a free place to crash for the week.”
And no ‘puters to consume the day studying recent ancient history. And maybe he and Lina could use some time alone.
He agreed, and Lina was happy. Doing well enough to muddle through Somerville Community College and keep Lina in his life were about the only two things he could focus on at one time. Maybe some fun time would calm him. </Text>

            <Synopsis>Des hears Diver's idea from Raefe. He agrees to try. He reports back that his initial attempts have blown his mind -- he's amazed at how the logic of the brain is so different than computers, so rich. Raefe is excited but not sure what to do with this information.</Synopsis>
            <Text>In the end, it hadn’t been as hard to leave Cambridge as Raefe had anticipated. He’d had a few long talks with Tosh, who alternated between sympathy and anxiety. In the end, Raefe could sense that Tosh had come to the conclusion that there was no use worrying about it. Caught between the inland fires and drought and the raging coastal seas that plagued their world, one could only do so much, and that would never be enough anyway. Raefe didn’t argue. He had found that there were worse emotions than pessimism in this world.
Not that he was feeling it at the moment. He had abandoned his initial romantic notion of walking north and settled in on the train. It would take three days to get to the north, three days with his thoughts, with a birds-eye view of what this part of the world had become. As they headed toward the Canadian border, it didn’t look all that different in Vermont than he remembered it. Not that Vermont existed anymore — there was a patchwork of city and county governments that did their best, but no one bothered with the remnants of the United States up here anymore.
There were hillsides where the dryer summers had brought insect infestations that had killed off many trees. But thankfully, these were islands in the general green of northern New England. Lake Champlain was a bit smaller, although still large. Here and there the lower waters had created peninsulas out of what had been islands. No one owned that land, so homeless people from the flooded coasts had set up tent cities on them. On one of the larger peninsulas, he could see the beginnings of more permanent dwellings — dead trees from the surrounding hills had been cut down and dragged there, made into lumber and now some kind of longhouse dwellings.
Soon they crossed the old border into Quebec. The train didn’t even slow. It would stop in Montreal, where what was left of the Quebec government still held sway. He had time for a nap before that. Just as he was starting to doze off, he felt a tickle in his mind. It was Des.
“Hey, Dad. Wanted to wish you safe travels on your journey, but I guess I got here too late. All the same…”
“Thanks. I’ve got two more days on the train until I get to Hudson’s Bay. So far, it’s surprisingly normal. No marauding gangs attacking the trains.”
“That’s good news! Were you expecting any?”
“No, not really. I do remember that happening back in the ‘40s, when the shit really started to hit the fan. Some white supremacist militia groups — really they were mostly biker gangs — would attack trains, terrorize black and brown people, steal from everyone and disappear into the woods. They had this idea that the climate crisis wasn’t real, that it was all just a big excuse for dark-skinned people from the cities to steal their land. Sort of petered out after a few of the big glacier drops into the sea. Hard to argue that those were a hoax.”
“Progress, I guess. So you’re going to be a farmer, eh?”
Raefe laughed. “Yeah, imagine that. I don’t know if I’ll actually settle up there — probably not. I’m more interested in learning what the people who are settling are doing.”
“They all have net channels, you know.”
“Yeah, I know. I’m not looking for a how-to vid on farming. I want to know what’s in their hearts — how the experience is changing them. And I mean them in the plural. How this new life is affecting their sense of themselves and others.”
“Interesting. I’ll be keen to find out what you learn.”
“You’ll be among the first to know, trust me. Meanwhile, I wanted to get your thoughts on something pretty crazy.”
He told her about his conversation with Diver.
“I don’t know what to make of it,” he confessed. “It rings some bells, but not that clearly, if you know what I mean. You’re the science guy of the family. I thought maybe you could make sense of it. Is there something to what she is saying?”
“Something,maybe,” Des answered. “Years ago, when I had to learn to extend entanglement to computers, I didn’t think much about where our minds came from But over the last ten or fifteen years, I’ve mulled that over. It can be interesting to think about how does a squirrel remember the hundreds of places it hid nuts. Or how does a school of dolphins and a pod of killer whales actually team up to hunt herring once a year in a specific fjiord in Norway? Because maybe we have those parts, too, only we’ve layered all sorts of stuff on top of them. But I’ve never dug into it. I’d have to think much more about it. I might contact her, too. Let me mull it over.”
Raefe was fine with that. They talked about Lina and Mari and the usual things. Des could feel Raefe was struggling to stay awake and said goodbye. The train surged onward across the flat plains of the Eastern Townships, rocking Raefe to sleep.
He awoke with a start. They were slowing down, approaching  Montreal. The train rolled along the south bank of the St. Lawrence. Raefe had been a frequent visitor to Canada when he was younger. In fact, it was one of the shared memories between his self in this timeline and the one he had drowned in. But he hadn’t been here in years.
After the Warren revolt had failed, some of his supporters in northern New England had tried to set up their own state along the border from Maine to the Thousand Islands. The movement never succeeded, but the diehards carried out intermittent disruptions and even occasional armed attacks for years until it petered out. Canada had sealed the border in that area, reopening up intermittently only since 2091. Somehow, he hadn’t had a reason to go north since then.
It was always a thrill to see Montreal, the big island in the river, it’s buildings set against Mount Royal in the background. You could visit any number of large cities on the east coast, but once you turned north, things got mostly smaller and smaller until you emerged from the flat prairie of the eastern townships to see this city that had always been a gateway to both the inner frontier and the outer world. What was different now was the river. The ever-changing climate of the 21st century had wracked the St. Lawrence. Meager snow melt had decreased the river at its source in Lake Ontario. The river had dropped so far and slowed so much that Quebec had been forced to build dams along it and ever more canals to keep the shipping traffic that underlay much of its economy viable. But the same climate forces also brought periodic storms and flooding that overflowed the banks, much as the Mississippi had experienced a century earlier. 
Now the wide banks were half mud, dotted with marooned freight barges. The imposing bridges that led into the city looked cartoonishly large now compared to the degraded river below. Still, the city was humming. But now its energy was not directed seaward to the Atlantic but instead to the newly habitable far north. Montreal was a free-for-all now of miners, farmers, and utopian dreamers, and the permanent residents who made a living servicing them as they passed to and fro. 
Seeing bands of young backpackers lining the streets through the train windows reminded him of Nila, the girl he had tangled with in New Kendall. Was it her who sent the message in a bottle to the Norcambs?
He wondered where she was. Not expecting much, he let himself dip into the local waveform. Montreal had its share of empaths, that he could tell. He listened quietly to the hum of the city, the emotional jostling of thousands of minds. It was a friendly hum. Where once the city had been a nexus of tension between Canada’s main cultures, the events of the last 50 years had broken down many of those barriers. Canada had its own Billy Warrens and Ken Robertsons, but they lacked the deep pockets and global power base to keep stirring the pot of ethnic rivalry. Left to their own devices, Quebeckers had slowly let go of the three-cornered conflict between First Nations, English and French that had been going on since the 18th century. Many of them were now bilingual in French and English and knew at least the language of a local First Nation, even if they still only spoke one language at home.
And then he felt something in the background, a familiar mind. It was Nila! He listened for awhile, letting his mind find her more fully. And then he reached out.
“Nila, hi. It’s Raefe.”
She was surprised, flustered. “Whoa. You can feel me all the way from Cambridge?”
“No,” he laughed. “Maybe if we knew each other better. I can tangle with my family anywhere in the world.” He didn’t mention his friends on other planets. “No, I’m just outside Montreal, on the train. Where are you?”
She told him about Thunberg.
“So was that you who sent a message to the Norcambs about leaving New Kendall?” he asked. “It made quite an impression on the them, I should tell you.”
“No, that was Mik. Remember him, my friend?”
“Vaguely. Tell him that he really changed some hearts and minds with that. You might not realize how low an opinion the Norcambs and the other homeless people have of New Kendall folks. They were pleasantly surprised to find you have a conscience.”
“Well, us too! We were never encouraged to develop one, if you know what I mean. But you can tell Mik yourself. He’s starting to learn to tangle.”
“That’s exciting. You may have more ability there than you give yourself credit for. How’s Thunberg?”
“Mostly amazing. At first it looks like some kids who’ve never seen a town built one out of Legos. But then they explain why everything is the way it is and you go, ‘wow, how come we never did that before?’ I can feel you’re very interested in it.”
“That’s why I came up this way. Thunberg is just one of many experimental communities in the new lands that have opened up since the thaw. I want to see what they’re doing. And to feel how it’s shaping people — are they changing, too?”
“Funny you should say that,” she said. “That’s what’s bothering me. They have all this really clever stuff, and if we all do it, it will really make an impact on the climate. But I worry that they think that’s all we need to do. I don’t know if they understand how people like Ken Robertson Jr. think, how the other side, if you will, thinks. Or even how to help all of us get through this. They’re so focused on progress.”
“Ah, now that is ironic. What bothers you about that?”
“Thunberg is just a little settlement of 6,000 people a million miles from anywhere. If Junior thinks it’s a threat, there’s a hundred ways he could damage it, or just wipe it away. My mom is a sec in New Kendall. I know the kind of shit they’re into.”
“Well, that’s legit. But I would say that there’s nothing new there. When we were just Citizens of Nowhere, we had to fight that fight, too. We’re not powerless.”
“For sure. And Junior doesn’t even have the resources and people his dad did. But I feel like Thunberg is in a dream. You guys knew you had to bring as many people together as you could, to get them thinking together. These guys are happy to have this little town and their feed on the net. They think people watching vids of them building sustainable housing out of swamp chemicals with solar electricity will change the world. I’m not so sure.”
“You want to see whole cities like that, is that what I’m feeling?”
“If it’s such a good idea, then yeah, why aren’t we going back to Boston and saying, stop all the half-measures. Let’s just start anew, let’s do it like this, cause it works and it will keep working. Cause all those people down there, they have no idea if what they’re doing will mean a hill of shit the next time the climate takes a turn.”
“That’s what I want to see — are all these little projects going to work for millions of people? And are they something that millions of  people are going to want to do? What I mean is, does living like this make them happy in some deep way they don’t have now? Because I’ve come to realize that we’re forgetting how to be happy. So much of our world is a managed death cult. It’s not like we have a choice. But we have to find one to offer people.”
“Wow, I guess I hadn’t gotten that far in thinking about it,” she said. “We could really use that perspective up here. There are other issues, too. They’ve got this kind of tough-guy attitude about everything. I thought I’d like that, you know, after all the fussiness in New Kendall. But it bothers me that the answer to everything is tough it out. That’s going to happen anyway — I wanted to hear how we’re going to tough it out without being crushed.”
“Well, you’ve definitely convinced me that I should head up and maybe start with Thunberg. Just for now, though, can you be low-key about that? I mean, I don’t care if you tell Mik, but it might be better if I met the rest of the Thunberg people on their own terms.”
“For sure. I’m new here. I don’t think they’d take kindly to me telling them they’re doing it all wrong and I’ve summoned you to fix it. But they know you, of course, and they have huge respect for Everywhere. So you shouldn’t have any trouble that way.”
She explained to Raefe the whole process for getting to Thunberg. He could find Noreen in Radisson, or maybe he could just tangle with Kaitlyn. She let him feel her memory of Kaitlyn’s mind so that he would recognize it.
The train was rolling to a stop. He would have to go into the station and fill out forms about why he was coming into Quebec. He said goodbye to Nila. How far she had come in such a short time! Young people were like that with tangling, still so open and motivated to reach out and touch the big world and all of its people. But there was also a darkness and a sadness in her that was different than the usual stresses he felt from people. He wondered where it came from. He would let her tell him, if she chose to.

            <Text>Not so sweet sixteen
New Kendall, MAJanuary 17, 2099

Mik watched the sunrise through his bedroom window. Here in New Kendall, fourteen floors up, perched on top of Arlington Heights, he could see reddening clouds splashed across the horizon. It was still dark enough that he couldn’t make out the barge cranes in the water around the big skyscrapers in Boston. It was his birthday today, the last of the century, and he hadn’t been able to sleep all night. Sixteen years old now, he would leave school in a few months to be assigned whatever work was next on the list. Maybe he’d be down there on the barges, programming the robot cranes to disassemble the Hancock or the Dalton before their water-logged lower stories collapsed and they came crashing down, push tons of water further inland. Maybe he’d be working in the greenhouses up here on the Heights. Or be shipped out somewhere else to bring home credits for New Kendall. Whatever it was, he was excited at the prospect of jumping the wall of this suffocating enclave.
It was only a little after 6 AM on this Saturday but he knew he wouldn’t get back to sleep. He walked quietly to the kitchen and scooped a handful of breakfast mix from the big tub on the counter. He sprinkled some caffeine dust into a cup of water, swirling it until it was properly mud brown.  He was just about to turn his Voice on to listen to some music when his mom walked in.
“The birthday boy himself,” Tiffany said. “You know, I got some real coffee for you for your birthday. You can have it now or later, your call.”
“Wow, thanks, mom,” he said. “I already had some of this, though. Waste not, want not, right? Tomorrow would be great, though.”
“Sure, and you’ll have the day off tomorrow, so you can enjoy it at your leisure.”
He wanted to skip school today but he was on thin ice there. He needed to keep his nose clean or he might be shown the gate before graduation. His parents had already used up most of their social credits keeping him inside the walls. It would come down to letting him fail or all three of them losing their place here. He knew they couldn’t even imagine life outside of the protective arms of the New Kendall Corp. They had been in the original DigiBrands crew that had moved from old Kendall before it had become harbor bottom. He resigned himself to a dreary day, hoping to grab a little joy afterward with his tribe.
“So how are you feeling about turning 16?”
He shrugged. “I don’t know, mom. Too many things up in the air just now.”
“Well, it will be a new century soon and I think that will bring new hope.”
Mik studied his breakfast mix intently. Hope was the new religion in his parent’s generation and sometimes there was no point in contradicting their faith.  “Yeah, I guess you’re right. Just got to get through the next few months.”
He hurried through the rest of his breakfast, hoping to leave before his dad woke and joined the attempt to cheer him up about the future. He made a vague excuse to his mother about how he had to leave for school early.
“You’ll be home regular time?” Mom asked. “We have a little something special for the occasion.”
“Sure, but I’m going out later with my friends.”
He turned and walked out the door before she could voice her disappointment. The older he got, it seemed, the clingier his parents became.
He walked down the Park Street hill toward Mass Ave, which had been the main drag in these parts forever. The waters would never come this far. If he really squinted hard, he might be able to see some of the vast marshlands still expanding around the edges of the Mystic Lakes a few miles east where there had once been prized waterfront homes and even a marina. Looking right on Mass Ave., small columns of smoke now dotted the horizon here and there, campfires marking the tent cities where the dispossessed lived around the edges on the other side of the newly expanded Alewife Brook. There, on the other side of New Kendall’s patchwork of walls, bridge checkpoints, and river patrols, would be where he would wind up if he wasn’t careful. There, in what was left of Cambridge and Somerville, it was every man for himself.
At least, that was what he had been told. Tiffany and Larry had come up here when he was a small baby, after a whole series of glacial melts had finally overwhelmed the sea walls for good and drowned the old Kendall Square that had been their home and livelihood. Like all the other kids up in the Heights, he had been on school tours in armored buses that gave them an hour’s worth of viewing of the hell that awaited them if they were not diligent and compliant. Many of the main streets were half choked by squatter’s camps, soldiers with serious arms guarded some of the areas that were so far unaffected, the smell of campfires and garbage was unavoidable. Schools were much more informal and occasional down there. Kids his age roamed the streets. They looked up at him and his classmates in their fortified buses with unflinching, clear eyes. He could never tell whether they were angry, amused or merely curious.
He turned his back on all that, going left up the hill on Mass Ave., walking up a few blocks toward his school, housed in an old grocery store. With the breakdown of supply chains, these super-sized stores that had dominated in his grandparent’s day were no longer viable. There were impromptu markets set up in the big field up on the hill when big shipments of food or other goods came in. It was all needed, and right away. So the building had been turned into a community center, with a school occupying a good part of it. It was nearly 8 AM and kids were milling about waiting for the doors to open. He could see some of his friends.
“What are you doing here?” his buddy Junior asked. “I thought you’d be home doing birthday stuff.”
“Like what?” Mik said. “Looking on the net at old baby pictures with my folks? No thanks. Anyway, I’m on the edge with school. I need to finish up and get out of this dump.”
“Amen to that,” Junior said. “We still going out tonight?”
“Absolutely. Already told my mom not to expect me to hang around all night. Cake and run!”
A little bell rang in his Voice. Time to get to class. First period was Geoengineering, mandatory for seniors.
“On your way to Gee, Oh, No Worries?” It was Nila.
He laughed. “Yeah, that’s about it, I guess. ‘By 2110, millions and millions of mirrors will be orbiting the Earth, reflecting the sunlight back and lowering the temperature. The future is bright, er, dark, er a reflection of, oh, I don’t know.’”
“Right, the bright dark future. Can’t wait!,” she shot back.
He was about to keep the joke going when he remembered her mom was in Sec. You wanted to watch what you said around Secs. Although they had been hanging out a bit recently, he still wasn’t sure where she fit in all that. Lots of Sec kids hated New Kendall, but some just said they did to avoid being avoided. Some were really gung ho, too. But it was the sneaky ones who would pass on anything you said that wasn’t hopeful enough, or loyal enough, or one of the many other virtues you were supposed to cultivate in New Kendall. 
“You seem thoughtful today,” she said at his silence.
“Nah, just sleepy. And dreading tonight. Family birthday party.”
“Oh, gak! Makes you want to never get older.”
“That and worrying about what work detail I am going to get,” he said.
They had reached the classroom, just in time. Another bell in their ears meant class was about to start. He scurried to his seat. Mr. Leonard already had a bunch of diagrams up on the big vid screen.
“Settle down, we have a lot to cover,” he said. “I’ve sent you all the materials, so you can review them on you Books later. Right now I want your undivided attention to what I’ve put on the board.”
Which was some insane scheme to convert the heat in the hottest places to electricity to run cooling machines to lower the temperature. His dad had worked on that project and he knew it was a total failure. The coolers also generated heat and in the end, the best that could be said was that if the wind blew the right way, the temperature would just stay the same. Why was Leonard droning on about how it was promising and they should keep their eyes on it? So typical. Everything was just around the corner, a few years away, you’ll see, it will all be a pleasant surprise. He bet that he wasn’t the first senior to hear that racket.
Then Leonard paused, as if he was having a stroke or something. After a bit, he resumed motion, like his heart had been restarted.
“Listen up, guys. We had a lesson planned for today, but we’re getting weather reports indicating a big storm brewing out at sea. So I’m afraid this is turning from geoengineering to flood control. Everybody is to assemble outside and get your assignments.”
Nila gave him a “what the fuck” look. He shrugged, having no idea what the fuck was going on. They all trudged into the field behind the school, pulling up their hoods against the rain, which was already more than a misting. A Sec officer he hadn’t seen before was talking.
“OK, kids, we’re going to do something different today,” she said, as if they were going to try skydiving or a new dance step. “We’re all going to go down to the river’s edge and help out with work there. Some of you will be reinforcing the levees along the Alewife. The older kids will be helping Security fortify the bridge crossings into Cambridge. If there’s a big storm surge, we may have a lot of unwanted visitors trying to reach higher ground. So plan on a long night.”
Groans went up around the room. Saturday might be a school day, but Saturday night was usually theirs to do all the things teenagers usually wanted to do. From past experience they knew that these storm details could last far into the night. All the older kids trudged over to one corner of the field to get their assignments. One of the Secs who was always around the school, Granger, was waving to them to gather around him.
As they did, they were enveloped by the sound of the sky ripping open as lightning exploded very nearby. The wind was picking up, driving the increasing rainfall nearly sideways at them. This must be the edge of the worst of the storm, he thought. Rumors were already flying about what they could expect in the next few hours.
“Ok, listen up.” Granger said. “You all know there’s a big storm coming. Behind us, the Heights are safe, too high to worry about the storm surge. All around us, New Kendall is protected by water. From the ocean all the way west to Belmont, there’s only one way into New Kendall from the drowned lands, and that’s this bridge. During a storm, no one crosses it unless we say so.”
“What’s the big deal?” asked Nila.
“The big deal is that in the next 24 hours, a few thousand people are going to get washed out of their campsites. They’re going to look for new ground, for food, for anything they can grab. Some of them will go to the high spots on the other side, but those are already pretty crowded and unfriendly. What we call the Buffer Zone at that end of Broadway and Mass Ave they may think of as fresh dry land for a new home. They’ll want in. And once they’re in, they’ll want to stay, and they’ll want our houses, our food, and whatever else. Maybe you spend a lot of time on the net and you believe all that empathy bullshit. One night with these people will cure you of that. It’s the survival of the fittest for the next day. For longer than that, but you’ll find that out eventually.”

*****
Mik had been assigned to a group of about a dozen kids who were supposed to work with Sec down by the river. So far, they had just been shlepping sand bags around. It was almost 2 now but it was nearly dark. The sun was still somewhere in the sky, but the wind had picked up and clouds were rolling in swiftly from the east. The temperature had dropped to an unseasonably cold low 30s. Granger had called them all to the command tent at the North Union park.
“Good work, guys, we’ve got everything in place. We’re hearing from that the storm has already started up in Gloucester, so it won’t be long before it rolls in. The State Police don’t have much left in them, but they do have a barracks up in Gloucester, and they’re telling us it’s going to be worse than we thought. Storm surge is going to be higher than 8 feet, winds are going to be in the 60-90 mile an hour range. Our own satellite feeds confirm that.”
“What about our families?” asked a kid Mik didn’t know.
“They’ll be fine, son,” Granger said. “The only issue is the winds, and the auto storm shutters will soon be activated up in the Heights. The best thing you can do for them is make sure this crossing isn’t breached.”
Granger made a bunch of mumbo jumbo assignments to the cops that Mik couldn’t understand. A sergeant named Wong grabbed their work detail and they walked down Broadway toward the checkpoint. Before, the Sec guys had been lifting sand bags, hammering wood together, hardening the normal checkpoint that was the only way in from the south. Now they had put down the construction tools and were crouched behind the barricades, combat vests on, rifles and machine pistols in hand. The kids all milled around, not wanting to get too close to a bunch of armed cops.
“What the hell are we doing here?” Mik asked Junior. “Are we supposed to fight?”
“I don’t know. Maybe that’s why we did the rifle drills in gym?”
Sergeant Wong motioned toward the high school kids. They shuffled over toward him, bent into the rising wind.
“We’ve got a little while until things are likely to kick off here. What we need you kids to do is be our eyes and ears. We’re in touch with units at the Mass Ave observation post, and at the end of Route 2 near Spy Pond. Normally, we run drones all along the water to spot people trying to cross in boats or swim. You’d think no one would try that in a surge, but you’d be wrong. But we won’t be able to keep the drones up in this wind. So we’re going to pair you up and give each pair a radio and binos.”
“Can’t we just use our Voice to reach you?” Nila asked.
“Absolutely not, for two reasons. One, this ain’t no joke. If you’re on your Voice, you’re not going to be paying attention and that could cost you your life. Two, the net could easily crash during this storm. So take the godamm thing out of your ear, find something waterproof to wrap it in, and keep this radio close at all times.”
Nila looked like she wanted to shoot something back, but settled for an exasperated sigh. The other kids were paying a lot of attention to their feet, trying to keep fear off their faces. Waterproofing their Voices meant only one thing: they wanted to be able to locate their bodies if they drowned and were stuck underwater.
Wong gave Mik and Junior their gear and sent them off to the abandoned biolab building on just off Mass Ave. The front side of it was half a block from the water, but it was three stories tall. They climbed up a series of metal rungs stuck in the back wall. From the roof, they had a great view of the area between the two Sec checkpoints. The sun still glowed on the western horizon, but to the east, black clouds lit by occasional lightning tarred the whole sky and they were moving toward them. The winds were beginning to lift dust and debris from the ground. Junior pointed to a small booth on the other side of the roof.
“We can hide behind that if the wind gets really bad,” he said.
Mik nodded absently, his eyes scanning past the Alewife. The streets were dark and empty — few streetlights worked in the drowned lands and it was not a night for e-skeeters or any of the other myriad battery driven personal transportation options. From his apartment, he could always see dotted campfires all along North Cambridge. From here, he could see the people around them, small groups scurrying to erect makeshift barriers. One group was pushing a long-dead car over toward their fire, angling the vehicle to be on the east side to give them shelter from the wind. Over toward the drowned Mass Ave. Bridge, people were moving toward a whole deserted neighborhood. The homes had long been stripped of wood or other burnable materials, but some still had brick or concrete shells that might give shelter in a storm.
“Poor bastards,” Junior said, noticing the same scene.
Mik wanted to say something like “serves them right” but he couldn’t remember why it did. “Glad that’s not us,” he replied.
“Will be if you don’t graduate,” Junior teased. “Or if we get taken prisoner.”
“Yeah, that would suck. If that happens, please do not tell them your name is Elonmusk Railford Jr. If they don’t shoot you on the spot, they’ll mock you to death.”
“Tell me about it. Even my dad thinks it was a mistake. Not his fault, I guess, that his parents worshipped Mars Man. Or that he was born right after Musk died and all his fanboys and fangirls like my grandparents were out of their minds.”
“Yeah, well, there’s lots of Elonmusks in his generation — must have been mass psychosis. Should have died out with the Mars colony, but here you are.”
“Well, if they torture you to find out my real name, then tell them. I can take the mockery. Used to it.”
Their banter was interrupted by explosive lightning and thunder. The winds had picked up, bringing the edge of the rain. The ran to the small booth for cover. They opened a half-rotten door. There was a concrete landing and then a stairway that descended into who knows what. They huddled on the landing as the rains now came hard. In the dark, with the incessant pounding of the rain and the walls shaking from the howling winds, they lost track of time’s passage. After what seemed like an hour, the radio crackled, startling them.
It was Sergeant Wong.
“Mik, Junior, report.”
“We’re pinned down on the roof, sarge. It’s howling up here, we’re stuck inside a little shack on the roof.”
“Well get your ass out there, and tell me what you see. I want reports every 15 minutes.”
Mik and Junior rolled eyes at each other.
“Yes, sarge, will do,” Mik said. “We’ll get right back to you.”
“I’ll take this one, Junior. You get next.”
He stuck his head out of the door. The rain was fierce, coming down at a 45 degree angle now. He pulled the hood of his jacket up over his head, cinching it tight around his face. He noticed that the wall of the building stuck up a couple of feet at the edge of the building. He ran toward the edge and then crouched down behind the wall. He got the binos out of his jacket and looked back toward the Mass Ave. Bridge. The Alewife was raging — it must be high tide and the storm was pushing the river backwards, water gushing out across North Cambridge.
He tried to find the areas where he had seen people before. Some were still there, huddled inside the old houses. But he couldn’t find the fields where he had seen the old cars — in that direction, everything was wet and shiny, reflecting what little light there was. No more fires. And then he noticed one of the cars. The top of its wheels were barely out of the water, which was swirling all around it. All the people had fled, but he couldn’t see to where. He looked a little further east. There was a hill, islanded by the Alewife to the north and the drowned fields to the west. Dozens of people were crowded in what remained of an old parking lot. At last, something he could tell Wong.
He ran back to the hut and radioed it in. Wong was concerned.
“Keep an eye on that hill, Mik,” he said. “I need to know if it gets too crowded up there, or the water is going to trap them up there.”
“Yeah, will do. We’ll call back in another 15 minutes.”
Junior looked confused.
“Why does Wong want to know that? Does he want us to rescue them?
“I don’t know. I don’t think he’d want us. Maybe they’d find a way to get the supplies. Does Cambridge still have a city governor? Maybe they’re in touch with them.”
“Yeah, maybe. I don’t really know.”
“Weird, isn’t it? We live a mile from them and we don’t even know if they have a government anymore. But we know about New Kendall colonies all around the world.”
“Mik, do you think it was always like this? I mean, back when it was Arlington and it was all part of Massachusetts and the United States. Were we like almost at war with them?”
“No, it couldn’t have been. I mean, old Kendall was in Cambridge, right?”
They sat silently, each pondering their own personal fog about exactly how it was that they came to be sitting on a roof top in a storm, spying on fugees across a raging river. Eventually the noise distracted them. They were getting wet too — the wind was gale force now, driving water through the cracks in the door. They took turns spying, but it was getting harder and harder to see. Mik snuck his Voice in for a minute. It was after 6 PM. He’d forgotten about his parents. Hopefully the school had let them know what was going on.
It was his turn again. He could barely move against the wind now, the rain like needles driving into his face. The binos were useless. He let his eyes adjust to the dark and scanned the hill where the fugees had massed. Just in the half hour their numbers had increased dramatically. Water was rising from the bottom, maybe from the side he couldn’t see. They were going to run out of room soon.
A glint caught his eye. Some fugees had found a small spit of deserted street that went right up to the drowned bridge. From somewhere, they had found an old dead truck with a flat bed and bare metal ribs where there used to be sides. They were pushing it toward the bridge. Why the hell were they pushing a truck into the water? And then he understood.
The bridge was underwater, but not that far. Before it had been abandoned, the city had tried to build it higher. Over on Broadway, that had worked better — the Cambridge side had a hill. But here on Mass Ave. It was flat and the geometry only permitted a little elevation. In the end, the river was only two feet deep there on a normal day.  So if they got the truck on to the bridge, some of the truck would be out of the water, at least if the current didn’t wash it away. But why?
He ran back to the shack and told Wong.
“Good work, Mik. I’ll take it from here — we’ll reinforce the checkpoint.”
“But what are they doing?”
“They tried this once before. They’re going to try and run zip lines to and from the truck so that people can zip down from that street they’re crowded on to the truck, and then from there to the roof of the old abandoned hotel on our side. After that, they’ll try disappear into New Kendall.”
“Oh, that makes sense. I think they’re scared the water is going to get to them on the hill. It’s not that big a hill.”
“Yeah, well, they’re not coming into New Kendall. Anyway, I don’t think we’ll need your reconnaissance for awhile. Stay dry!”
Mik looked at Junior, whose face said he was feeling about the same. Rescue was not what Wong was planning. Something messed up was about to happen.
“We can’t just sit here,” Junior said.
“What can we do?”
“Maybe nothing, but at least we’ll know what actually happened.”
Mik nodded. They both knew the Sec guys would never tell what really happened if it got ugly.
They waited a few minutes and ran to the building’s edge. Wong had been right. A couple of  fugees had already strung a thick rope from a big tree up on the hill they were stranded on down to the truck and tied it to the top of the bare metal frame. One person rode the line down to the truck. From somewhere, they had gotten a home-made crossbow. Mik could see now that it was a woman. She aimed the crossbow exactly where Wong had predicted and shot. He couldn’t see the arrow, but it was carrying a line with it. 
The line arced in the air toward the building, but a gust of wind knocked it down. The woman reeled it back in and tried again. After three tries, the line stuck. She yanked on it, testing it, pulling it taut and tying off on the truck’s skeletal frame. She attached a caribiner to the line and was about to haul herself up on to it when a bullhorn barked.
“Stand down! You are not authorized to cross into New Kendall. Go back and we will not harm you.”
She stared toward the sound. If she replied, they couldn’t hear it. Mik imagined her standing there, having made it through the wind and water, now to hear that her biggest obstacle would not be the storm, but people. He saw the waters swirling around the truck, rising up the streets around the small hill she had come from. She looked around, weighing her options. And then, with a single movement, she leapt up on to the line she had strung, head toward New Kendall, feet looped up on the Cambridge side, and began moving toward New Kendall. She pulled her feet toward her head, then extended her hands outward to move, repeating that motion and slowly crawling on the rope toward New Kendall.
Junior nudged him, “Over there!”
On their side of the river, between the water and the old hotel, about two dozen Secs had fanned out in a line. They were clumped in groups of four, all with rifles at the ready. One of the Secs closest to the bridge ran toward it, hurling something and immediately looped back to where he had come from. A flare burst in the air above the bridge, bright even in the rain. The light seemed to freeze the woman on the rope. She jerked and lost her grip, dropping on to the roof of the truck cab. She slid down behind it. They could see her, but she would be hidden from the Secs.
Mik pulled out the binos and focused in on her. She was holding her arm.
“They shot her, right?” Junior asked.
Mik nodded, as if saying it would make it worse.
“This is all going to shit,” Junior said. “Look up that hill — they know she’s been shot.”
Mik felt something in the air, as if the rain was now angry at them. Dozens of people were running toward the river. He saw a few stagger. The Secs must be picking them off. The storm was so loud he couldn’t hear the shots, but he had little doubt that was what he was seeing. But the fugees were determined and kept coming. They weren’t going to crawl out on the zip line, but they each had thrown their own line up over it and hooked themselves to it. It was just what they had drilled in school about how to  wade out into fast moving water to rescue someone.
By now, a handful of people  reached the truck. The first ones tended to the wounded woman, but the rest stayed at the back, and they began to push the vehicle. As there numbers grew, the truck began to inch forward. One of the Secs shot a flare high into the air. It burned just bright enough in the dense rain to illuminate what had now become quite a crowd at the back, backs bent into the truck. Mik could see their faces, frozen in the light like one of those big old fashioned paintings. Sec was back on the bullhorn, warning them not to move further, but he could see they had chosen their path and it was forward.
They could hear on their radio that Sec was trying to shoot out the tires on the truck. He could see silent little geysers as the bullets hit the water around the tires, black puffs when they hit, and sparks when they hit the metal rim. But by now, there were enough people pushing it that it didn’t matter.
And then the gunfire was deafening, a sharp, explosive sound. One of the Sec groups had a machine gun mounted on the back of small truck. It was firing repeated short bursts. Each crack of the gun on their left was followed by a few fugees on their right falling. Some hung on to the ropes they had tied to the zip line, some couldn’t and were quickly swept toward them on the river. He heard Junior swearing but he couldn’t take his eyes off. More fugees rushed down into the water behind the truck, pushing it faster. It looked like they might make it across after all.
And then the staccato cracks of the machine gun turned into high-pitched whine, like some kind of power saw. The gun swept back and forth across the truck and the crowd behind it. In only a few seconds, twenty or thirty people dropped into the water, so many that the current couldn’t just sweep them away. Those not shot tried to pull some of the wounded away, but between the gunfire and the current, they had no chance. They scurried back up the hill, running into an abandoned building where they would no longer be visible targets.
Mik and Junior ran back into their shed, shivering and too shocked to speak. Hours later, Wong told all the students to assemble at the Broadway checkpoint, the worst of the storm had passed and trucks would take all the students home. On the truck ride back, some of the kids were hyped about the storm, some bored, and some quiet. He could see in those quiet faces that he and Junior had not seen an isolated incident. And he knew that his face was sending the same message: don’t ask.
It was near midnight when he got home. The power was out. He got to his door with little memory of walking the fourteen flights. He opened the door to hear the sound of wind, which at some point had driven a stray branch through the living room window. Everything in front of the window was wet and disheveled. 
“Thank god you’re ok,” his dad said.
“I’ll heat up some food for you,” his mom said. “We can still celebrate.”
“Celebrate what?” he wanted to know.
“Your birthday, Mik!” his dad said. “It’s still your birthday. Just give me a minute — I was just about to put up some plastic on the broken window.”
He wanted to scream, to pick up everything that was trashed on the floor and throw it out the window. And he wished he could plug his memory into the monitor on the wall and let them see and hear those machine gun bursts and the bodies slumping into the water, pinwheeling away into the dark. And maybe worst, the fugees running back up the street that was filling with water. He hadn’t had the guts to look after that, to see what had become of them, down there where there weren’t fourteen flights of stairs to walk up to a mostly dry apartment. He wanted them all to stand there and watch it and then tell him that anyone should be celebrating another year of this, of graduating into a world like that, where maybe he would be assigned to Sec and get to shoot the next group of desperate fugees. How had he not understood all along that this was the world they were always pushing him toward? And did they understand that, or were they just drugged by fear and small favors that they never had the guts to really look at what was going on?
“Hey, thanks,” he mumbled. “It’s been a rough night. Maybe tomorrow?”
And he went into his room and closed the door before they could answer.

            <Synopsis>Raefe is in a coma,but his mind can now reach out.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was dark, but he could sense most of the people in the encampment, like small candles through heavy fog. Some sputtered with fear, some burned hot with anger, many flickered dully. Ah, there was Davis. Raefe had suspected that he was a tangler and now he could feel a weak connection. Davis didn’t notice. Raefe would deal with him later.
Now he wanted to find Lina. He searched the camp. There! He started to run to her and realized that he couldn’t move. His eyes were closed. He seemed to be lying down. Was he dreaming? Unconscious? He felt panic rising through him.
He calmed himself, trying to read her energy. She was hurt, but he couldn’t tell how badly. She needed help and he needed to figure out how to help her. He shut out all of the other minds, letting hers fill more and more of his awareness. She was in a tent with two other women. They were awake, talking quietly. He felt Lina tense as one of the other women poked at a wound on her face. Changing a dressing, that’s what she was doing. He didn’t know how he could know this, but he knew it, as if he was blind and Lina was telling him what she was seeing, only she was telling him silently.
He let his mind spread farther and deeper, wrapping himself around her. He could feel where he would tangle with her, if she could. He remembered being touched there by Aleron, the feeling of having her mind pass through his without actually touching him. Schools of fish, that was how it had felt. He thought of one of the reefs in Miami, and pictured himself a school of silver jackfish and Lina a school of blue parrotfish. He felt himself glide through her, the mental tendrils of his school brushing past her many small tendrils.
It worked! He could feel her thoughts now, swim among them, feel the currents she created as if she, too was swimming through him. It wasn’t easy, though, and he forced himself to be patient, to let her currents wash over him, and let his mind feel them and understand what they meant.
He could feel time passing, but had no idea of how much. Slowly, discrete memories and thoughts assembled themselves. She was hurt, but she was breathing OK. She could walk. She was full of rage and fear. He had been hit with the rifle butt and knocked unconscious. Shit, that had been two days ago. She thought he was in a coma, she was deeply concerned about him, her thoughts cycling like a hamster on a wheel, building up momentum.
He sunk into more memories and was horrified.  While he had been lying here, she had been beaten and then raped. He had to help her but how? He untangled from her. He couldn’t control his mind anymore, do this delicate dance. He let his thoughts scream, he felt like a thousand watts of angry electric guitar, wailing into the night air.</Text>

            <Text>Island life

Raefe and Lina were jammed into a big helicopter with 54 other fugees. A half dozen Brightstar mercs kept an eye on them, hands never far from their weapons. The chopper roared off the launch pad, the noise of the rotors and the wind a thick fluid filling the cabin.
Raefe could smell the sea now, as the wind whipped through the open chopper door. They passed over Logan Airport, its runways lying drowned, feet to the terminals, heads under water. Deer Island was once again an actual island, the causeway leading to it submerged and little but the globes of the waste water plant visible above the surf. To the right, the thick stone walls of an old colonial fort stuck 5 meters out of the water like an aquatic Stonehenge, their foundations invisible beneath the choppy water. To the left and right, the familiar coastline of the harbor was blurred and smudged by the new tide line and tons of sandy mud.  Near the sea, roads  came and went, sea walls had become islands, half-drowned buildings tilted in the surf.
Coming from the Somerville hills, down across the shore, out over the drowned islands, Raefe felt like some character in an ancient myth. A character descending into a watery underworld, filled by souls the planet had washed from the land.
He watched Lina’s brown curls swirl in the wind, exposing the ugly, ropey scar on her right ear she never talked about. He knew that she got it as a girl in Efricar, during the civil war there. What was going through her mind, to have survived the Efricar holocaust, escaped to Sofricar, migrated here, and now, once again a fugee and for all practical purposes, a prisoner? He could feel her anger and her sadness, but something else he couldn’t quite name. Something dark and deep. Was it the same feeling that was enveloping him, that they were refugees now, not from some human conflict, but from nature itself?
They swept out over the open water and soon Truro Island was in sight. They landed on field of hard packed dirt on a bluff 25 meters above the ocean. Their first words of welcome to the island were an incessant, robotic, “Single file, single file” from the mercs grabbing their arms and pulling them off the helicopter. A soldier gave them a more informative introduction through a bullhorn.
“East Somerville Work Detail welcome to Sea Wall Construction Camp Alpha. You will be reporting here at this exact spot every  morning, Monday through Saturday. Sunday is yours. Sergeant Merto will be your work detail leader. Sergeant!”
“Yes sir! Listen up. You are on Truro Island, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. See those seals on the sandbar? They’re sitting there so they don’t get eaten by great white sharks. It’s October and prolonged immersion in the water is cold enough to kill you, even if the sharks don’t. The mainland is 30 miles from the other side of the island. You will all be chipped in the arm. If you get lost, we can find you. If you run away, we will find you.
“You’re all here because Hurricane Fatima broke the Atlantic Sea Wall and made you homeless. So now you can work off your relief aid by rebuilding the wall. Specifically, the part of that sea wall extended from Truro Island north to Cape Ann. We will load up barges with supplies and go out to the work sites. Some days we will return, some days we will stay out on mobile work camps on the water.  The work will be hard, but you’ll get three squares and a roof over your head at night. We’re all here to do a job, but we won’’t tolerate any funny business in the camp. No gambling, no pimping, stealing — you get the picture.”
“Lastly, some of you fancy yourself some kind of lawyer and you’re going to ask me about your rights. Forget it. For all practical purposes, you are no longer in the United States, you are an employee of Digi Brands. And Digi has subcontract to Brightstar to take any and all means necessary to get this wall built. Short of executing you, we have total authority while you are here. This project is forecast to take 11 months. After that, your life is yours to fuck up how you want. Meanwhile, don’t screw this up.”
 Lina whispered to him, “Welcome to my world.”
 They got injected in the arm with a tiny telemetry capsule and then were issued yellow overalls with names and numbers written in red marker. He was now Epstein Miller, 4456, she was now Kawambai Yang, 5198. The whole crew spent the afternoon putting up large tents where they would sleep. Just like Somerville, sleeping quarters were divided three ways into families, males, and females, with a fourth tent for eating.
Night brought a quiet to the camp. Back in Somerville, some of the people had played cards at night. Sometimes small groups gathered around the few people who had rescued a guitar and sang songs. This night, no one was in the mood for socializing. After a desultory meal of curried lentils, with a token bit of chicken, Raefe and Lina wandered aways from the tents. A big oak had somehow survived all the hurricanes, and they sat down against it, the camp to their backs. He had never seen so many stars.
“Do you think they’re laughing at us up there?” he wondered. He put his arm around Lina but felt her stiffen. He knew that sometimes Lina didn’’t want comfort, so he let it go.
“Only if their world isn’t as fucked as this one.”
“There’s a thought — what would they say to us if we could talk to them? From a world that made more sense this.”
“That made any sense,” Lina said. “How does it make sense that two kids like us, just trying to put one foot in front of the other, almost drown in a catastrophic flood, and now are risking death working against our will on a construction project in the middle of the ocean?”
She stood up, fidgety, pacing.
“I don’t know,” Raefe answered. “Can I ask you, was this what is was like when you were a kid in Efricar?”
&quot;No kids in Efricar,&quot; Lina said, looking away from him, staring out across a barren field. &quot;Just little people trying to live long enough to get big. Living like this was not the worst that could happen to you.”
Raefe could hear seals barking and squealing 50 meters offshore as they pushed and shoved for the best sleeping spots. Twenty years ago, we left their world. Wonder if they’re happy to see us back, he thought. I think you’ll get your island back soon enough.
“You’re putting on your armor for the long haul, aren’t you? You’re getting ready for another couple of years of this,” he said.
“Maybe,” she said. “I don’t know.””
“No, it’s OK. I can feel it.”
Lina looked at him sharply. “You don’t know what’s in my mind.”
“That’s the thing,” he said. “I realize I do know some of it, a lot of the time. And not just you. The night of the flood, why I woke up? I felt the screams and the terror of the people at the water’s edge, the first people to drown. I thought it was a dream, but it was the real thing.”
“How do you know?”
He wanted to tell her about Aleron, but it didn’t feel like the right time.
“Let’s just say that since that night, I’ve been paying more attention. The headaches and all that — I realize I was just overwhelmed by other people’s feelings sometimes. I’m just one of those people that’s very tuned in, subconsciously, to other people. I can smell anger, or lust. Strong emotions like that, I can feel them in other people.”
She eyed him silently for a few seconds. “And you think you feel what I’m thinking?”
“Not so much in words as images and feelings. Alright, tell me I’m wrong. When we were on the dinner line, you saw those lentils and you thought about eating those with your mother in Efricar. It was a nice memory, like you were a girl sitting with your mom under a tree, eating. But then it hit you hard, right, here I am, like a girl in Efricar, in a camp with soldiers. And you instinctively wiped any expression of your face so the guards couldn’t decipher you, because that’s what you learned in that camp. That’’s what I meant about armor.”
Lina looked away.
“You’re freaking me out. I don’t know if I realized that myself, but you hit it pretty much on the head, now that I think about it. All this time we’’ve been together, you’ve been doing this?”
“No, not at all. I started to realize something was going on,” he said. Make something up, it’s not time to tell her about Mars Girl. “I found stuff on the net, here and there. People like me are called empaths. Everyone is a bit of an empath. I’m just more so. And because we’re already close, I get more of you than I do of strangers. Anyway, I just wanted to say that you don’t have to put up your armor with me.”
“Seems like it won’t work anyway. But I’m worried about you — armor is a good thing when you’re surrounded by hatred. You don’t want to be smelling that too much.”
“Right, need some anti-hatred deodorant,” he laughed. “But you know what? I think we’re going to be OK. These guards — they’re pretty relaxed. Just doing a job. I don’t think they’re waiting to gun us down soon as we’ve finished the wall.”
“How about the sharks? What are you smelling from them?”
***
 In the morning, they piled on to flat bed trucks that took them to the beach. They drove along empty, broken asphalt roads, a black ribbon through the grey forests, leaves long killed by years of salt-laden hurricanes. Here and there, the dead wood was streaked black from lightning fires. Around a corner, the sun shone bright off something green. They drove closer — it was algae growing in the salt ponds, safe from the ocean waves. 
The beach was a different story. There were trucks, piles of materials, many trucks unloading prisoners and supplies. Zodiacs came and went. They sat huddled in one, then get off on a sandbar. The seals barked at one end while they stood knee deep at the other, building a pylon out of recycled plastic blocks. The morning sun warmed the shallows but by afternoon the clouds had rolled in and they could no longer feel their feet. The guards let them rotate in and out of the water, giving them a few minutes to get the feeling back in their feet.
Raefe found himself sitting on mound of building supplies next to the man who had interrupted Robertson back in Somerville. He tipped his head to Raefe and grunted a “Hey.”
“Alton Winchester,” the man said. “And I’m guessing you’’re Raefe?”
“How do you know my name?”
“I saw with you with Lina. Used to see her down at the K&amp;K. She talks about you a lot.”
“I dug what you did the other day.”
One of the guards came over and glared at them.
“Alright ladies, I’m sure your little footsies are warm enough now. Back to work.”
As they trudged back into the water, Alton looked back for an instant, mouthing “Look me up tonight.”
That night, in the mess tent, they found Alton and sat down next to him.
“So here we are,” Alton said to Lina. “Two fugees trying to survive the apocalypse again. And not even Kayam’s Cubanos to make it almost worthwhile.”
“You haven’t missed a beat with that Goodstuff Benjamin track,” Lina said.
“Who’s that?” Raefe asked.
“Me and Alton always ago round about him,” Lina said. “He’s a Nigerian guy Alton’s into.”
“He’s not just a guy,” Alton said. “He’’s a teacher, a leader. He’s the head of the New Voodo Army. They’re into mass resistance to the corpos, the mercs, the religious extremists.”
“So pretty much every authority figure in the world,” Raefe laughed. “Who’s left to run things?”
“They are,” Alton said. “That’s the point. The NVA is all about self-determination.””
“Alton, before you give us that speech,” Lina said, “I have to ask you. Did we just go from being fugees in Somerville to prisoners on an island?””
“You’re not wrong,” Alton said. “Technically, we can leave. But we give up any claim to any benefits or support. Total free agents.”
“Son of a bitch,” Lina swore. “Where would we go?”
“Wherever we go, we are always in the diaspora. Nothing has changed.”
“When I came here five years ago, I thought I was leaving all that behind.”
“Same for me. I came here in ‘39 from Jamaica, after the plague. I was one of the 5%, the immune ones.”
“What’s going on,” Raefe asked. “What just happened?””
“They only tell us half the story,” Winchester said. “I’ve been in touch on the Net with different folks.  That storm was the worst since the ‘41 floods. But the impact was the biggest ever because it hit so many people and it was in the belly of the beast. The New York financial center. The Boston bioinformatics complex. The  US economy brought to its knees. Beaches littered with dead fish. Fresh water reservoirs turned into salt ponds.””
“Where does this all fit in?” Raefe said, waving around the chopper.
“Looks like Digi swooped in, forced the Feds to give them a lot of East Coast territory. It’s a disaster zone now, but they get to run their own economic zones near all the big metro hubs. They pay no taxes, they can squeeze their competitors, and call the shots about what gets rebuilt and what doesn’t. First thing they want to do is protect their investment, get this sea wall up.”
Later that night, Raefe lay awake on his cot, still but unable to sleep. For much of his life, he had felt overwhelmed by the constant flux of people and their feelings. This place reminded him of a long car ride he had taken as a little boy, somewhere out in the midwest where it was empty between the cities. Cars were still common then, and there was still radio, before they all got Voices and eyeball ‘‘puters and everything was there on the Net. His mom sat in the front seat, trying to find music on the radio dial. But there was nothing but static, the empty sound of the universe.
Now, his mind was a radio, and he could hear faint signals from all the stations in all the minds around him. Most of it was fatigue and despair. But there were notes of affection for friends, happiness over small things, and always, the desire to hope. I have a gift, he thought, that I don’t know what to do with. Where was Mars Girl when you needed her?

            <Text>The belly of the beast
Raefe stood at the front of the ferry, watching Ilfracombe come closer. The rocky peninsula that rose 50 meters out of the ocean was a natural sea wall for the harbor, preserving the docks from flooding. Behind the docks, hills rose steeply into the North Devon countryside. After a week of traipsing around the North and Wales, he had made it to South England, Ltd. He felt a sense of excitement — he would be entering the belly of the beast, one of the largest and richest corporate states in the world.
He wandered down to the vehicle deck to find the car and Claire. She had stuck with him through the trip, his guide and protector. The blizzard had hit Newcastle only hours after they left and hadn’t stopped yet. She had become much quieter as the week wore on.
“Fancy a pint when we land,” he asked. “I figure you could use one.”
“Maybe later, guv,” she said. “Want to keep my wits about me down here.”
“Fair enough,” he said. “I’d say knock off the ‘guv,’ but down here they’ll like that you say it.”
“Just a habit, really,” she said. “Been in the Urban Gypsies for years now, but them’s giving the orders, still’s the guv. And with all due, guv, you’re not just some office boss. We’ve all got a lot riding on what you’re up to.”
“Well, I’ll try not to disappoint.”
They had swapped Claire’s Northern Electric truck for one of Vietnam’s finest, a Peach three-wheeled fuel celler. With its plug-in conversion kit for rainy days and optional solar panels for sunny ones, it was probably the most popular car on the entire island of Britain.  And there’s was painted in  default Buddha Orange — their car would not give them away.
“I’ll connect my puter to the car so we know where we’re going,” Raefe said. Claire had used the onboard puter with the truck, but he suspected she was a typical Urban Gypsy when it came to being unable to afford net fees for her own puter. “Kayam, take us to the Tunnel Beaches.”
“Kayam?” Claire laughed. “Why’d you call it that?”
“Long story,” he said, watching the patchwork of lively streets and derelict neighborhoods out the window. “He was a guy I knew when I was a kid. Used to hang with my girlfriend at his coffee stand. Had my first puter then, used to watch the news vids while we had our morning coffee. He was an early fugee, he always wanted to know what the news was. I was always saying, ‘Computer, what happened in the Caliphate last night? Kayam wants to know.’ So when full AI interfaces came in a few years later, it was my own little joke to say ‘Kayam, what’s happening in the news.’
“What ever happened to Kayam?” she asked.
“Don’t know. It was turbulent times. We were all moving around. He and his partner, Kiko, they lost their stand to one of the first big coastal floods. We were all scattered to the winds.” He stopped, realizing he was talking about his first life. Every now and then, random memories from that past emerged as if they were part of this life. Still only Lina knew about that, but he suspected the twins had figured it out. Not much got by them.”
“How have you kept your wits about you through all of this?” Claire wondered. “I’m only 35 and it wears me down. And you’ve been fighting this fight almost as long as I’ve been alive.”
“No, I wasn’t conscious back then. Just a victim, like everyone else. Only we didn’t even know it back then. We were like drunks with a hangover — felt terrible but remembered the party from the night before. Still thought there would be more parties than hangovers. What was wearying was trying to figure out what to do. Have you been to Trafalgar or Picadilly in London?”
“Yeah, sure, back in the old UK days.”
“Even then, right, certain streets would have these massive streams of bicycles, motorbikes, three wheelers, taxis and the occasional big old auto. And if you had to cross, it was just bewildering. You wound up just wandering through it, trusting no one would hit you. Only that’s where the metaphor breaks down: no one was actually steering the ‘cars’ in life and you could get run over very easily. Just bad luck.”
“Is that why you got involved with the Free?”
“Yes and no. There were no Free yet. There were people like Goodstuff Benjamin, who started the New Voodo Army way back in the 2040s. Citizens of Nowhere went back into the ‘30s. But I didn’t know about any of that. I was just a kid, a software grunt, and then I began to feel these connections to other people. Not in some poetic way, but real connections. I could feel people’s emotions, and that meant I knew who I could trust. And with fugees, that’s huge. Every fugee mistrusts everyone around them, and everywhere they go, everyone mistrusts them. And with the weather and the corpos, fugees were fast becoming the world’s leading product. And it was starting to get ugly — riots, killings, you know all of that. And I realized I had a chance to help stop it. Maybe even to find a way forward. Nothing else felt important at that point.”
This was the narrative he had crafted over the years to explain himself but also to hide his first life and the Guardians. In the old days, he and Lina had talked with Aleron many times about that. She had strongly urged them to never reveal that, and they had acceded to her in that. In his heart, he still felt that humanity would be much better off knowing about the Guardians and the broad history of intelligent life in the Galaxy. But maybe it would be another thousand or two years before that would be truly helpful to human beings. He had to trust her on that.
“Fair weather on you for that, mate,” Claire said. “So where we headed in little Ilfracombe?”
“I’ve set up a meet with a contact who can help us evade the corpo police. He’s got us meeting an an old changing house where there used to be a beach on a small inlet. There’s tunnels under the cliffs from the changing house to where the beach was — that’s all washed away now, but the tunnels are still there. Should be safe and quiet.”
“Had to give up the artillery when we ditched the truck, but I still got these,” she said, raising her hands in the air. “In case it’s not all sunshine.”
“If it’s going to go bad, it’s going to go bad and we’re just fucked. Besides, it would be better if he doesn’t see you. I’ll know if he’s with other people. If he’s alone, you can stand watch on the road. You’ve got your Voice?”
“Yeah, I’ll let you know if trouble’s coming.”</Text>

            <Title>Nila goes to sec conf</Title>
            <Text>Nila had only been far outside of New Kendall’s gates a few times, and all of those were on sanctioned field trips. The teachers tried to scare the kids straight, as they called it, by showing them first-hand what life outside the bosom of New K would be like. The message was clear: fuck up and you’ll wind up living in tents, eating half-spoiled food, fighting for every little scrap, like the rest of the world that was not protected by New K.
Her mother was a frequent traveler. Sec people were always gathering in various places to plan whatever shit it was they planned. Once Valoris had let it slip why: they didn’t trust the net. They had hacked it many times and they knew that Everywhere had people who could hack them even worse. They had ways to make it hard to make sense of their everyday business, sure. But periodically, Robertson gathered the Security Forces to launch major initiatives, strategic plans that would be instantly useless if their enemies knew of them. And Ken Robertson Jr. had no enemy he hated more than Everywhere, who had thwarted his father’s plans for imortality and near-god-like powers nearly 20 years ago. He would never let them interfere with his plans for New Kendall again. So nothing would be said about this trip on the net.
So here was Valoris on a hypersonic jet to Cheng Mai, her daughter in tow. No way was she leaving Nila alone for a week. Valorie was quietly briefed routinely by the Horizon team on her daughter’s comings and goings. Sneaking out of New K, hanging out with decadent people like the enacters, provoking her teachers with provocative questions. Horizon told her is wasn’t uncommon for the children of New K officials to act out like this, but Valoris was for sure not leaving her to her own devices for a week. The Horizon team’s job was to spot threats over the horizon —both timewise and over the borders of New K— and they had declared Nila not a threat. But no matter what Horizon said, it would come back to her if Nila did something really stupid. It could come back hard, she could lose everything she had worked years to build.
Nila knew all of that but she didn’t really care. If irritating her mother got her a free trip to the Lanna Autonomous Region in southeast China, all the better! Deep down, she was sure her mom would eventually get screwed by New K, no matter what Nila did. Because that was how New K worked — they sucked you in, got you to do their dirty work, and then threw you away if you fucked up or they just didn’t like you anymore. And then they would tell everyone that they never really bought into Valoris, they always had their eye on her, and they had their eye on anyone else who might sympathize. She almost felt sorry for her mother.
The trip had been short but thrilling. At 4,000 mph, the flight had taken only two hours. It wasn’t the speed she noticed, but the altitude. At 60,000 feet, the Earth was definitely curved and she could see way to the edge of the horizon, see much of North America in one view, and the whole east coast of Asia soon after passing Hawaii, barely visible from that altitude.
And now she was walking out the door into a very different world. Chiang Mai was in the mountains, almost 1,000 feet above sea level. Far to the south were the remnants of Thailand, now mostly a series of rivers and canals. With too little land to farm, most of the people had come north. The rest had stayed on boats, learning how to live off the vast flocks of fish and crabs now colonizing the giant marshes. That was a no-go zone for New K citizens, home to the Rising Tide faction of Everywhere.
It had been 20 years since China had seized the northern region of Thailand and some adjoining lands in Burma and Vietnam, claiming the people of these regions were really Chinese, spoke languages that were related to Chinese, and belonged in China. India had warned them off western Burma and Vietnam wasn’t worth the fight they would put up to keep the Chinese out. The Lanna had been a slightly disfavored minority in Thailand, but the Chinese were still seen as occupiers. There was a steady low-level war of words between the local government and Beijing over everything from food to Buddhist temples.
It was in these troubled waters that New K had found good business. They sold the Lanna things the Chinese didn’t or wouldn’t. They surveilled the Lanna for China in ways the locals couldn’t detect. New K had no interest in occupying the territory as long as it was making money from both sides. So New K bigwigs felt perfectly safe having a sales meeting and employee morale week at an old Buddhist monastery high up on a hill. Only a few trusted locals were there attending to their needs. No one would know that this was actually an important Sec war meeting.
That much Nila had learned from eavesdropping on her mom’s calls, and every once in awhile, sneaking a peek at her thoughts. But what struck her walking off the plane was the dry heat. Even in late winter, it was nearly 90 deg. The rains only came for a few months in late spring now, and the rest of the year, the hills were brown, dotted by invasive desert plants that had hitched a ride on Chinese transports from China’s vast inland deserts. In another century, it would all look like the cactus-filled scrub in one of those old Western movies that she had seen with some of her enacter friends.
For now, she tried to absorb the strangeness of this hot yet dry place as they rode in a strange little half-bike, half-solar-powered car toward the monastery. At home, there was water and green everywhere, too much of it. Here, they would kill to have lakes and streams of fresh water running everywhere. For the first time, it hit her what humanity had done to the world, beyond the petty squabbling for resources that New K and the Norcambs fought out. Her usual simmering resentments gave way to a more anxious bubbling, as it suddenly struck her that she actually had no idea what any place would be like when she was her mother’s age. How could she escape New K if she didn’t even know where it would safe, much less better? She resisted that idea — she was going to go and going was better than staying and somehow it would all work out. Or not. Fuck it.
“You’re awfully quiet,” Valoris said.
“Just soaking it all in,” Nila said. “Very different than home.”
Valoris smiled. “Home is very different than most of the world, these days. I hope you appreciate that.”
“Oh, not to worry,” Nila said. “I know New Kendall is not much like where most people live. I’ve just never seen anywhere so dry close up like this. Things just look different.”
“Well, you’ll have plenty of time to look,” Valorie said. “What are you going to do this afternoon?”
“I don’t know, just wander around, I guess,” Nila said. “Are there any other kids here?”
“Probably some,” Valorie said. “There usually are. Maybe they have a meet up for you all.”
They were at the monastery now, lining up to go through a security check. They were scanned for weapons. There were a bunch of honchos further down the hall shaking everyone’s hand. As they got closer, she realized that the main greeter was Ken Robertson Jr. She had never seen him in person before. He was just a few feet in front now.
“Good to see you, Val,” Robertson said. “Looking forward to hearing what you’ve got for us. And this must be your daughter?”
“Nila,” Val said. “Say hi.”
“Uh, nice to meet you, Mr. Robertson,” Nila said.
“You, too, Nila,” he replied. “I hope we’ll be getting to know you better in the coming years.”
Somehow that just sounded creepy, but she kept her smile firmly fixed.
“That would be an honor,” Nila said.
And then they walked past. So Robertson knew her mother by name. And now her. But her mom? She had only ever thought of her mom as some middle cog in a giant machine. She could feel that her mom was amused that meeting Robertson had kind of thrown her.
“So that was Ken Robertson Jr.,” Nila said. “Looks just like anyone else.”
“He’s not,” Val said. “He’s whip smart and he never forgets anything. Twenty years from now, he’ll make a joke about the look on your face when you first realized it was him.”
“Was it that obvious?”
“Sure, but everyone reacts like that. He gets a kick out of it, don’t worry.”
“Do you work with him a lot?”
“Enough. And now I think we are at our rooms.”

            <Text>Behind the curtain
New Kendall
January 18, 2099
“Mik!”
It was Junior on his Voice.
“What the fuck, Junior. It’s like 6 AM.”
“I know you ain’t slept. Meet me up by the old water tower. Half hour. We need to talk.”
“Yeah, OK, see you.”
Junior was right. Laying awake all night, replaying the whole thing, every time he closed his eyes he heard shots. Which was weird, because in the storm he hadn’t heard a thing. Just the awkward motions of people dropping, then realizing they had been shot. And killed? He was sure of it.
He walked away from Mass Ave toward the old stone tower that had been at the top of Park Street for centuries. It was falling down now, but all the kids knew how to get inside, where there was still a room that no one could see or hear from the outside. Junior was already there.
“What are we going to do?” Junior asked, nervous and pacing.
“Do? Why do we have to do something?”
“Because we saw it all. You think they’re going to let us just walk around and tell everyone?”
“They shot some fugees. What’s new? I mean, it was horrible, but not the first time.”
“Yeah, and do you know anyone else who saw the other times?”
Junior was crazing him now. 
“You think we’re in danger?”
“I’m just saying, we need to think very carefully about our next moves.”
“Next moves? This isn’t a vid, Junior. Our next move is to go to school tomorrow, like we would do anyway.”
“Yeah, OK, maybe that’s a good start.”
“It won’t be enough,” a girl’s voice said from the dark side of the room. Nila stepped into the light filtering in through a hole in the wall.
“What the fuck, Nila,” Mik said. “What are you, a spy for the Secs? You following us?”
“No, idiot,” she said. “I’m trying to help you. Yeah, my mom is a Sec, I know. You think the Secs want any part of me?”
They both laughed. If Nila wasn’t so wicked smart, New Kendall would have marched her across the Broadway bridge years ago.
“I heard my mom talking to work,” she said. “At least four people died out there where you were. The fugees are all up about it, they want blood. You better hope the honchos don’t decide you’ll do for a token peace offering.”
“Would they do that?” Mik asked.
Nila shrugged. “Do you want me to find out?”
“We’re so fucked,” Junior said. “What are we going to do?”
Mik thought about it. “Nothing. We keep our mouths shut. If anyone asks us what happened during the storm, we couldn’t see anything in the driving rain.”
“And what about that tool, Wong?” Junior asked. “He knows we did see it.”
“Exactly why he’s going to be happy we’re keeping quiet,” Mik said. “They’re just going to blame him, he doesn’t need any witnesses saying they weren’t armed, or that it was very unlikely they would have made it across the drowned bridge. I mean, it sounds ridiculous they even tried.”
“Yeah, that could work,” Nila said. “Let’s hope.”
*****
Twenty-four hours later, Mik was still walking around free. No one had put a black bag over his head and taken him to be interrogated, or whatever it was that the Secs did when you were on their shitlist. Here he was, walking around school at 10 in the morning like nothing happened. In a way, he was disappointed, a bit outraged even, that nobody was talking about any of it. Maybe they didn’t know about the shootings, but everyone knew the storm had been big. And most of them had heard that the waters would not be receding now that another glacier had taken a dive. He saw Nila at the other end of the hall making furtive eyeball gestures at him of the “come here” variety, but he wanted to ignore her. Instead, she trotted over to him.
“He’s here!” she said, forcing the words out between clenched teeth so that no one could hear her.
“What?” he said. “Who’s here?”
“The man,” she said. “REM.”
“What? No — you mean?”
“Yes, Raefe,” she said. “Downstairs, in the Corp. office.”
“You saw him?”
“Not exactly, but I know he’s here. I think they’re talking about…what we talked about yesterday.”
“No shit!” he said. “Oh man, this is not going to be good.”
“Why do you say that?”
“I mean, I know he’s super cool and all that, but this has to be trouble. I don’t need trouble.”
She laughed. “Don’t believe everything you hear. He is cool, for sure.”
“Man, I wonder what’s going on down there.”
“If we can get close, I think I can figure it out,” she said.
“What, you think we can listen at the door? Oh, wait, you can’t…”
“Yeah, some. Keep it to yourself, though.”
Completely, he thought. Now it all made sense, Nila’s attitude. She was an empath. The Corp. kept them out of the town — they needed them for certain activities (not that he knew what), but they were frowned on here in New Kendall.
“My lips are sealed. How close do you have to get?”
“I don’t know. I’ve never been around someone like him. He can tangle with the whole world.”
“Why don’t you try here?” Mik asked. “There’s no class in that room for the next hour. I’m supposed to be doing independent study, so no one will miss me. You?”
“Yeah, the same. So that works.”
No one was around. They ducked in the room and took their puters out so it would like they were working. Nila sat still, her expression distant for a second, then she nodded.
“Man, I can feel his mind so clearly.”
“You can just read his thoughts?”
“No, silly. He has to let me. I let him know I was here and I wanted to listen in. He can feel I’m not trying to harm him. He wants kids in New Kendall to understand what’s going on. To understand what Everywhere is really about.”
All his friends talked about this a lot. New Kendall, their parents, no one wanted to talk about Everywhere. And Raefe Epstein Miller, he was maybe like their least favorite person in the world. What was he up to? The net was full of stuff, some of it fantastic, some of it horrifying, most of it hard to know if it was true or even real. But here he was, his friend tangled up with the most famous empath in the world.
He started to ask Nila what was going on, but she waved him silent, saying just, “Not now.”
They sat there for about a half hour. He watched a drama unfold on her face as she followed the action. Her expression got more serious, than angry, then determined. Finally, she looked up.
“After school. The tower. Bring Junior. Tell no one.”
And then she ran out, leaving him alone and confused. He still had time before his next class. He heard a commotion outside the building. He looked out the window. Half a dozen Secs were escorting an old man, two younger women and a middle-aged man down the street. Their attention was definitely on the old guy. He was thin, with tight gray curls. He was wearing old clothes. Mik realized with a start that it was REM. He had never seen a picture of him, but he hardly looked like the threat to civilization that his parents made him out to be.
He went through the rest of the day on autopilot, his head still spinning from the last few days. He hadn’t had much of a sixteenth birthday, but it was starting to feel like some kind of vid game where had just passed through a new level and now had possession of new magical knowledge. Only he didn’t know what it was or what he was supposed to do with it. He sent Junior a message about meeting up, making it clear not to bring anyone else.
It was windy and cloudy by the time he got to the tower, barely visible in the nearly moonless winter dusk. The temperature had dropped to 40, everything was still damp from the storm. Junior and Nila were already there.
“Good,” Nila said. “You’re here. I told Junior the basics.”
“So what happened?” Mik asked. Nila could be dramatic sometimes, and he wasn’t in the mood.
“It was amazing!” she said. “He knew I was there. He wanted me — us — to know. He thinks New Kendall lies to us and if we knew what was going on, we would want to change it.”
“What’s he like?” Junior asked. “I mean, you hear all these things…”
“He’s…kind,” she said. “I don’t really know. I’m new to this whole mind meld thing. I mean, I’ve never actually had a conversation with anyone this way. I feel stuff coming off people, but I’ve never done this.”
“So you tangled?” Junior asked.
“Yeah, now that you say it, I guess that’s what we did,” she said.
“So what happened?” Mik asked. “Who was there, what did they talk about?”
“Raefe was there with two people from Everywhere — Tosh and Sura — and a fugee named Ines. And from our side, it was the head of Sec, Major Sindh, and some tool named Bartlow, no idea what he does besides listen to himself talk. Raefe said that Everywhere was there to represent the people on the other side of the river, and that they were all upset about Saturday night. Four fugees died, and two more are in tough shape. He wanted to know why the Secs fired on the fugees.”
“So what did Sindh say?” Mik asked.
“He started to talk and Bartlow jumped in. He was all ‘in the opinion of the corporation, nyak, nyak, illegal actions, threatening our personnel, nyak, nyak, we regret,’ and all that bullshit. But Everywhere weren’t impressed. Ines was ‘so you were concerned that a dozen unarmed, half drowned homeless people in a dead truck were going to overwhelm a company of armed soldiers behind a fortified checkpoint? And that’s why you killed them?’ And Sindh was like ‘We gave them fair warning. We had no choice when they took aggressive actions.’”
“Fair warning! That’s a lie!” Junior said. “He told them to stand down. They never said stop or we’ll shoot. Or fired warning shots. It was ‘Hold up!’ and then bam, bam, bam.”
“And they weren’t being aggressive,” Mik added. “A woman threw a line across and clipped on to it. She was going to zip out of the river. The water was fast and rising. Sons of bitches! So what did Everywhere do?”
“So Tosh was trying to keep Ines from jumping across the table. That was her, I suspect, on the zip line. Raefe was calm, but inside, fierce. He told them they wanted guarantees that this would never happen again. He said New Kendall has to discipline the officers in charge. And make reparations to the fugees. Something about rebuilding the bus yard.”
“So throw Sindh under the bus and pay off the fugees,” Mik said, slightly disappointed. “I guess that’s all they could expect, anyway.”
“No, it wasn’t just that,” Ines said. “Because then he told them New Kendall is now almost completely surrounded by water and it won’t recede because of the latest big ice that fell in. And that New Kendall can’t survive on its own any more than Everywhere. He wants New Kendall — not the whole corp, just the town — to agree that we and Everywhere will always help each other when life is at stake. They don’t want anymore people to die like that.”
“Well, that’s interesting,” Junior said. “New Kendall likes to say Everywhere can only get in one way, but now they flipped it.  Hah! You can only get out one way. Sindh couldn’t have liked that. What did he say?”
“Barlow cut him off again,” Nila said. “’Must consult with, we appreciate your coming here,’ nyak, nyak. And then, this was so cool, Raefe let me know that he could sense that it was all bullshit. I mean, anyone could. But the cool thing was that he knew that Barlow was thinking about how to spin this to the top brass, and was wondering if they should throw Sindh under the bus. And Sindh was thinking maybe he should throw Wong under the bus!”
“Yeah, that sounds like the New Kendall we all know and love,” Mik said. “Not too sentimental. Dry land, dry eyes. Junior, I think we’re cool. They’re going to be worrying about bigger stuff.”
“You bet,” Nila said. “Because right after Barlow tried to shut them up with all that ‘must consult’ stuff, Ines cut in. I don’t think she’s really with Everywhere. She’s like some fugee rogue. She told Barlow that the Norcamb fugees wanted blood, but they had agreed to let Raefe do his thing, and now she was wondering if that wasn’t a mistake. She gave him 24 hours to come up with a reply that wouldn’t send them over the edge. Raefe didn’t say anything. I think he wanted Barlow to understand shit is getting real.”
“Man, shit is getting fucked up,” Junior said.
“So you can tangle now with this Raefe guy?” Mik asked. “Anytime, anywhere?”
“Maybe,” Nila said. “Why? You want to send him a message?”
“Maybe someday,” Mik agreed. “Just good to know that you can talk. So what are we going to do now?”
In the end, they agreed, nothing. This was too big for the three of them, and they had no idea what to do. Nila said she would write down a transcript of what she had heard through Raefe’s mind and put it somewhere safe, so they had proof if they ever needed it. They went their separate ways, glad for the dark to give them cover.
Later, Mik sat listlessly eating dinner while his parents chattered about their usual meaningless stuff. He stared out the dining room window, the well-lit streets of New Kendall fanned out down the hill. And then, darkness surrounding their self-made island in all directions, just as Raefe had described. He thought of Nila and Raefe tangled up and was surprised to find he was deeply jealous.</Text>

            <Title>A dreamy meeting</Title>
            <Synopsis>Aleron explains to Raefe who she is and what she is doing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A little while later, the 'cane harvester got off. Their car was almost empty and they dozed on and off. Raefe slipped into a deep sleep, dreaming about being in Rio for Carnival.
There was a long line of odd looking people, sambaing toward him. He danced down the line, shaking each person's hand, asking their name and where they were from. Olaf, the Viking pirate, Norumbega, dives for pearls, on down the line he went until he came to a woman who looked nothing like anyone he had ever met.
She was more than 2 meters tall, but there was something about the way her shoulders, hips and feet formed a long, sinuous arc that was as striking as her height. At first she looked white, but then he realized she had a faint violet glow about her, as if lit from within. She had long black hair, but it too had a faint purplish tinge. And her eyes could only be called fuchsia.
&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked her.
&quot;I'm Aleron. I'm glad we are finally getting to meet, Raefe.&quot;
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot;
&quot;I became interested in you some time ago, and I've been learning about you.&quot;
&quot;What? Why would be watching me?&quot;
&quot;Let's go sit over here.&quot; She waved toward a small grove, with a little curved bench big enough for the both of them. There was a slight breeze that kept the trees tilting this way and that in a quiet rustle. Overhead, the sky was blue with tufty cotton clouds. The Carnival music had disappeared.
She sat across from him and laid her hands on top of his. They seemed weightless yet warm. She closed her eyes and without thinking, so did he.
He felt as if the two of them were passing by each other, no more like through each other, as if they each were a school of fish swimming at right angles to each other without touching. Startled, he opened his eyes. She was smiling at him.
&quot;There, now we are more firmly linked,&quot; she said.
&quot;Linked to what?&quot;
&quot;To each other.&quot;
He looked down. She wasn't touching him anymore but he still had that feeling.
&quot;You have many questions and some of the answers will be hard for you to understand or believe. So let me start with the biggest news. I am not human. Nor am I actually here. I live on a planet my kind call Anonto – it means Red Flower in your language –– around a star more than 20 light years from you.&quot;
&quot;And you've travelled here to see me? Why&quot;
&quot;No, I have not travelled to your world. It would take many lifetimes to travel to your world. But like many other intelligent species, after thousands of years of watching the stars and trying to understand the universe, we have found ways to send signals vast distances through shortcuts in the universe. You call them wormholes. Unlike some of your more imaginative entertainment, living things, nor any other objects of any size, cannot go through wormholes. But energy – information --  can.&quot;
&quot;So, you're just some kind of holo vid?&quot;
&quot;Not exactly. Perhaps you will take a course in your school that goes deeper into physics and it will become easier for you to understand. But the basic idea is that when the big bang happened, what was once a mass of energy, all interacting in a single waveform, flew outward and cooled and separated into the universe we see. But subtle connections remain between matter that once was connected, subtle pathways for waves to form. Your physicists call this quantum entanglement, although they are far from understanding how it works. We have learned how to travel those pathways and strengthen them, even across wormholes. So right now, my brain and your brain are having a conversation over these many light years because we are entangled with each other.&quot;
&quot;How did this happen? Did someone plant a chip in me?&quot;
She smiled. &quot;No, you have a great gift. All living things sense entanglement to some degree – we all have atoms and even smaller particles that condensed out of the primordial bang and this creates a very low level field that we mostly aren't aware of. You and I, and many, many others, somehow concentrate this entanglement more than our fellow beings. We are not sure why or how. But we know it's true and have been meeting living creatures throughout the galaxy this way for thousands of years. And before us, for more than a billion years, other creatures have been doing the same.&quot;
&quot;I don't know what to say. I don't feel particularly special. I'm just a kid who gets headaches, sometimes daydreams too much, and is struggling to get through college. Sometimes I feel like I want to do something big, but I don't think even I believe that I will, and I know no one else does. I'm one of those people other people say ''nice guy, not too ambitious, a little dreamy' about.&quot;
&quot;Your headaches and daydreams are a symptom of your gift, and of your inability to channel it. I will help you with that in time. As for the rest, I think you are going to do big things.&quot;
Raefe felt like a guitar string that had been plucked and couldn't stop vibrating. Her words were like a song playing in his head. Did she feel his thoughts in the same way?
&quot;Yes, that's exactly it,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I do feel your thoughts that way. In time, it will seem unremarkable to you and you will begin to notice that from other people in your world, too. But now I have to tell you some hard things, and ask your help.
&quot;There is a loose association of advanced lifeforms called Guardians who speak to each other across these wormhole links. I am one of them. I am working to nurse your species through its most dangerous epoch. You see it all around you – your species has developed great destructive power. You could wipe yourself out in a day with nuclear weapons. Right now, you are wiping yourselves out with a slower destruction of your environment. You have learned a great deal about the natural world, and can manipulate it for both productive and destructive purposes. Yet you know very little, yet, about yourselves. About how your own minds work, and how to steer them to avoid these calamities.&quot;
&quot;Wow, you can say that again. That's all we seem to do – mess things up and then talk about why and how. But we never seem to change much. What can we do?&quot;
&quot;I can't tell you that. Both because I don't know – every species must find its own way – and because Guardians have learned the hard way that accelerating your development through giving you extensive knowledge of discoveries you are millennia from reaching on your own never works. Ultimately, your knowledge of yourselves and the physical universe must develop in a new way, in a more linked way, which you will have to find on your own.&quot;&quot;
&quot;Seems kind of creepy, like you want me to join some kind of sleeper cell for aliens.&quot;
&quot;You will have to judge our motives and actions for yourself. But my goals isn't to have you carry out some plot. These People who are entanglers, they connect with other People in different ways. They sense different parts of what ultimately will be a solution for your species. My only goal is to connect you with each other, so that you can begin that work yourself.
&quot;Can I tell anyone about you?&quot;
&quot;I would advise against it. I think you understand on a very basic level that if you discuss this with others, the issue will become your sanity, not the substance of what it is to be done. For others, the narrative will come too close to religion, and they will become passive, thinking that the Guardians will save them as some kind of gods. In billions of years, intelligent life has never found gods. If they exist, they hide well. Although we also still cannot explain some aspects of how the universe works, gods have little to do in our worldview. So you should probably think of me as a muse, a source of inspiration, that you meet in dreams.&quot;
&quot;Ah, so this is a dream?&quot;
&quot;Yes, for now, that is how we will meet. But you will remember all of it. And now, I will show you how to deal with those headaches.&quot;
He felt a warmth, as if a tiny river of honey was flowing from one part of his head (or was it just his mind) to another. He understood that he could turn that flow on next time he felt that migraine-like headache, and it would soothe it. He smiled. This was going to be alright.

            <Notes>The man ignored him and turned to the passengers. “Allow me to introduce ourselves. I’m Alton Winchester, and we are the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We came to defend Richmond from the coal companies. They want to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia. They need that water to turn that coal into chemicals they can sell. The corpos tell these boys a fairy tale about how they’re saving the country, but that’s what this is about. We got word that this train was under attack and we hurried over here.”</Notes>

November 14, 2048

Aleron was pleased with how the class had gone. Getting the cadets to be humble in the face of the many irritating and irrational aspects of unenhanced intelligence was neither easy or optional. She would have to return to that again and again, or risk having some of them dismiss the worth of the very species they were supposed to be guarding.
Her thoughts were interrupted by an urgent summons in the waveform.
“Aleron, this is Manulo, from Information Analysis. Please give us your full attention.”
What could they want? They monitored standard electromagnetic communications through across the wormhole interface.
“Please focus on the stream from Earth,” Manulo instructed. “This information came through the wormhole interface network only minutes ago.””
News reports, satellite photos, military communications all arrayed in front of her. A volcano had erupted on the Isle of Surtsey, off the coast of Iceland. She understood immediately that Raefe might be in danger.
“Will it impact the area near one of our contacts, Raefe Epstein Miller?”
“Not the volcano. But Earth geologists say there is a 30% chance the volcano will cause an underwater landslide. Our simulations are more clear. The slide of the entire Greenland ice sheet into the ocean almost 10 years ago caused some upwelling of the tectonic plates. The earthquake that accompanies this volcano will almost certainly cause the eastward face of the island to shear off and fall into the ocean. The result will be a tidal wave over 50 meters high and it will move at a speeds close to 500 kilometers an hour.”
“He will be killed?”
“Yes, in less than three hours. While the area of destruction will be smaller than the recent hurricane, he will be in it and the destruction will be much more profound.”
“Please forward your summary to the Guardian council immediately.”
She contacted Anatope.
“My main Earth contact, Raefe, will be dead very shortly in his current timeline. Manulo has forwarded the situation. Can you identify an alternate timeline that we can transfer him to?”
“You know I can’t do that without authorization from the council.”
“No time for that. This is an extraordinary situation — a catastrophic earthquake and tidal wave.”
“I’m sorry, Al, but the truth is that human-induced climate change is the aggravating factor here. You know I can’t authorize a timeline shift due to social factors without council approval.”
She disconnected, frustrated and angry. She felt Salmerikon reaching out to her.
“I just heard from Info Analysis,” he said. “What’s the status?””
“We have to shift him to a new timeline. Fast. Anatope won’t give me a suitable timeline. Says the catastrophe is the result of human factors, and so the whole council has to approve.”
“Never mind that. I’ll explain to you later, but I’ve been worried about this all along. I’ve got a contingency plan. A new time line. You’ll have to prepare him though. Let me know when you’re ready.”
There was more going on here than she understood, but there was no time for that. Nor could she get to the wormhole itself. She would have to focus extremely hard and cut through the noise. Raefe was stronger now, it should be easier. He was on an island, working. They had never connected while he was awake, but she had no choice.
She found his mind and assumed the Mars Girl image. He smiled.
“Hi, it’s me again. Don’t stop what you’re doing, don’’t speak. I have important news to tell you and you can just think and I will know your thoughts.”
“Right, hello to you, too,” he thought. “What’s up?””
“You are in danger,” she said. “Your island will be hit by a massive tidal wave in the next few hours. But don’t be afraid. I have a way to save you.”
“Are you sure? You can tell that from 20 million light years away?”
“Yes, there’s no doubt. When the time comes, you will wake up somewhere else.”
“What about Lina?”
“I’m not sure if she’ll be there. I’m trying to learn everything I can about what we can do, but we may not be able to save her, too.”
“Then forget it. She’s stood by me through so many things. I’m not leaving her. And I’d be lost without her.”
“Well, you wouldn’t be leaving her, in any event. It’s complicated and we don’t have a lot of time. Let me find out more about Lina. I’ll be right back.  It will be quick.”
She found Salmerikon.
“Salmerikon, he won’t leave Lina.”
“We could move him anyway.”
“I don’t think he’d ever work with us again. And he could go insane. Is she in the timeline you have chosen?”
“Well, she’s alive, but she’s never met him,” Salmerikon said. ““She’s in Efricar, there’s never been a holocaust.”
“So she won’t have died, in his new world, but they will never have met. I don’t think that will be enough, though. He’’s dependent on her for emotional stability.”
“If we transfer her consciousness, too, and then tell them how to find each other, will he agree?”
“Probably, but how can we do that?”
“No time now. Let’s just say we can.”
***
Raefe asked the guard if he could get some water. He gave Lina a look and she nodded back. After he went up to water station, she made her own excuses and found him.
“Look at me,” he said. “Don’t talk. Hold my hands and look right in my eyes.”
Hearing the urgency in his voice, she did.
He could feel her mind. Not clear like Aleron’s, but there. She startled, but kept her hands with his. He saw a little smile on her face and felt a warmth. He thought “I love you”” and closed his eyes.
They both collapsed, lying lifeless on the beach. The guards rushed over. The workers watched as two guards tried to revive them. One of them had a med puter.
“Their hearts are beating, they’re breathing!”
“Good. Send the feed to HQ. I’ll call and see if they want to evac them,” their sergeant said.
“They may not want to,” the guard said. “I’m getting no higher function brain waves at all. Seems like they’re on internal life support.”
“Hey, Sarge,” another guard spoke up. “I don’t think we’’re going to evac them. Turn around.”
The guards and the workers turned back toward the water. Far on the horizon, a strange gray curtain pulled up out of the ocean. The curtain was moving quickly toward them and revealed itself as an avalanche of water falling down an endless 50 meter high water.
The sergeant threw down his rifle at the feet of the two bodies.
“Lucky bastards, to escape before that.”

            <Text>Get her goat
January 20, 2049
It was just after dawn when Lina slipped quietly out of their condo in the Shanzu district onto Serena Road. She wanted to get to the market while the stalls selling African foods were still open. It was Sauda’s birthday and she would make her a meal of Kenyan foods. Yang Zhao had banished most local dishes from the dinner table, so Sauda’s treat would have to be a lunch of ugali and nyama choma.
Serena Road was only half full at this hour, three wheeled delivery vehicles and lurching electric buses the main traffic. Most of the Shanzu inhabitants were like Zhao, Chinese middle managers  who took the bus a few kilometers down the 88 to the port in Mombasa. Zhao worked there in the main planning office for Chinese civil engineering projects on the Kenyan coast. Others took the light rail up to the big cement manufacturing complex in Bamburi. They were just waking now. In ninety minutes, the market and all the shops would become theirs, filled with local fish and chicken, imported pork and vegetables, and whatever else was imported to make Africa seem like an extension of the Middle Kingdom.
For now, the locals could fill their needs and wants. Lina ambled through the dusty market streets wedged in between the 88 and Old Shimo La Tewa Road. She found the ancient woman everyone knew only as Auntie.
“Milima, is your house on fire?”
“No, Auntie,” she smiled, playing through their usual routine. “Only my mother’s stomach. Her Chinese daughter sleeps, but her Kenyan daughter comes for your medicine.”
“So half the mountain comes to me. You are in luck. I have a fresh batch of meal, just the medicine for your mother. She is lucky to have such a good daughter, to fetch it for her.”
“And even luckier that I am going to make ugali for her today.”
Auntie’s face betrayed her skepticism. “When did you learn how to make ugali?”
Like most of the locals, Auntie was keenly aware of the Chinese disdain for Kenyan food and customs.
“Sometimes, when my father is away, Sauda cannot help herself,” Lina said, laughing. “She makes us Kenyan food. When I was a girl I’’d complain and she’d just say ‘I’ll forget how otherwise.’ And she’d show me how, too.”
“Well, don’t forget, the secret to good ugali is to wait until the water is hot, and stir in the meal with a straw whisk. I’ll give you one if you don’’t have one.”
“Thanks, Auntie, that would be great. Mom will be grateful.”
She wandered through the market, feeling the energy of the shoppers, fresh from sleep, not yet worn down by a long work day in the heat. And something else — a comfort, an ease that came from the familiar. It was the same feeling she got from her father when he was among his countrymen. The feeling that so easily could turn to discomfort and unease with each other when Kenyans and Chinese came together. She wondered how to change that. Could it be changed?
Her musings were interrupted by the site of Musa, the halaal butcher.
“What brings you out so early, Milima?”
“I wanted to be sure you still had goat.”
“You are going to surprise your father?”
“Not unless you have Chinese moon cakes. Goat, that would not be a pleasant surprise for him. No goats in China, you know. No this is for my mother. I’m going to make her nyama choma.”
“Oh, she will love that. Make sure you get the right wood for the barbeque grill,” Musa said, and proceeded to give her a long series of tips on how to make the best nyama choma.
As she walked back up Serena Road toward the ocean, she could sense people behind the doors awake now. Behind her, the native district smelled of mandazi doughnuts and chapati bread, heavily milked chai and coffee. In front of her, the Chinese quarter was full of congee, steamed buns and tea. She could feel the contentment that everyone in all directions had as they ate their first meal. So many ways to the same happiness, so easy to mistake the food for the satisfaction it brought.
She had a brief flashback of espresso  and corn muffin with Raefe. It made her happy, but she had to laugh imagining them sitting in a tea shop in Shanzu. People would be thinking, “My, she’s Chinese and African. He’’s white. Seems like they’ve got the whole world covered.” And then some! If they had a kid, they could get it a T-shirt: “I’m one quarter Jewish, too.”
Well, they’d burn that bridge when they came to it. If only.

            <Text>Voodo Redux
June 2, 2049

Meal time at Dadaab was always interesting. Some of the men would not eat with unaccompanied women, some of the women agreed. Others deliberately ignored the old traditions. Raefe had noticed that this caused some friction.
“Do you ever talk to that man in green turban?” he asked Lina, pointing to a man sitting by himself rather than near sit with women. 
“He won’t speak to me, since I’m not married,” she said. “Maybe now that you’re here, he will.”
Raefe didn’t want to say his next thoughts out loud. “Can you sense his feelings?”
“No,” she thought. “He is a closed door to me.”
“I wonder if we can change these attitudes.”
“They are changing, but so slowly.”
“I don’t mean by the usual way of arguing and debating. What if he could understand your feelings, my feelings, and see that we are not a threat? That you are here just because you are a person, not a temptation sent by God or devils?”
“I don’t think it will be that simple. For these men, power over the women of their little villages was the only power they ever had.”
“And at what cost?”
“To them? I see where you are going — their ways could never keep them safe and now that’s perfectly obvious. This is really the heart of it, isn’t it?”
“Still,” Raefe said. “What difference will gaining empathic powers make? Maybe I mean, how will it make a difference? What would we do if he would let us connect? What would we want him to do if he could entangle with anyone? It’s frustrating sometimes, to have this ability and not know what to do with it.”
Their thoughts were interrupted by someone standing behind to Lina.
“Do you mind if I sit with you?” the man said, pointing to the empty space on the bench.
“Please, sit down,” Raefe waived. The man looked vaguely familiar, odd considering the circumstances. “I’m Raefe.”
“Ah, you are the American,” the man said. “I was born there.”
“Really? How long did you live there?” Raefe asked.
“Until my early twenties. Then I moved to Nigeria. Allow me to introduce myself — Alton Smith.”
“Raefe Epstein Miller. And this is Lina Kawambai Yang.” He could feel that Lina remembered him, too, from Truro Island. He felt like he was looking at a ghost.
“Pleased to meet you, Lina. I see you are another African Diaspora child. My mother was Nigerian, but she married a Latino man from the Carribean who worked on the oil rigs in Nigeria. They left that hellhole and went to the Dominican Republic.”
“Actually, I’m more part of the Chinese Diaspora,” Lina said. “My father came to Kenya to work and here I am.”
“Oh well, we are a mobile lot, we humans, aren’t we?” Alston chuckled.
“When we’re not fiercely defending some patch of dirt we’ve managed to convince ourselves is better than anywhere else,” Raefe said.
“Indeed,” Alston said.
“Are you new here? I haven’t seen you around,” Lina said.
“I’ve just arrived from Nigeria,” Alston said.
“Are you thinking of becoming a Citizen of Nowhere?” she asked.
“In a way,” he answered. “I’m here to talk about an alliance. I’ve been working with Goodstuff Benjamin in Nigeria. Have you heard of him?”
Raefe couldn’t remember whether he had heard of Goodstuff in this world. “I’m not sure. The name sounds familiar.”
“Maybe New Voodo Army?”
“As in soldiers and guns?” asked Lina. “Not likely Nowhere will want to go that route.”
“We are not soldiers. We are ordinary people. Our biggest weapon is actually our technology, what we call New Voodo. We make power, grow crops, build houses, all in ways that don’t poison us, and don’t make us slaves to the corpos.”
“So why the ‘Army?’” Raefe asked.
“To scare away our enemies, of course,” Alton laughed. “Seriously, we sometimes do have to defend ourselves. Here in East Africa, you face ragtag pirates and former jihadiis who find it easier to pillage than farm. Although in fairness, the drought has taken away much of that option. Unlike Kenya and the other countries in the area, Nigeria has a strong and very corrupt government. They fund many militias to keep the people in line. And when that doesn’t work, the Army pays a visit.”
“So you are at war with them?” Lina asked.
“Not really at war. We just needed to be able to defend ourselves if they raid us. Our people are not nomads — they are villagers. What good is it building a new way of life if you have leave and build it over every two or three years?”
“So what do you want with the Citizens?” Raefe asked.
“We want to get ready for the future. We want to find safety in numbers, for both groups. And we want to learn from each other. Nowhere is basically an idea about identity and governance. New Voodo is about how we use the planet. We are on the same side — can we make something stronger together?”
“Wow, that’s ambitious — I’d love to learn more. Raefe is going back to the U.S. tomorrow, but I’ll be here for awhile. I’m part of Edna’s band. You know her?”
“Not yet. I’ll be meeting with some sort of loose council — maybe she’s on it. I gather this place is not big on heirarchy.”
“No, it’s not,” she said. “Not guns either. But on the other hand, it sounds like NVA is more advanced than us in building new kinds of villages and infrastructure. So yeah, sounds cool.”
Later that night, lying in the forest after making love for their last time in awhile, they listened to the birds, letting their thoughts flow silently.
“I’m going to miss you. Both of me are going to miss you,” Raefe thought. “Actually I think the new me is up to speed on you now,” caressing the curve of her breast.
“Likewise,” she said, returning his caress. “Important things have happened while you were here.”
“Aleron will be pleased to know. The time she bought us has been useful. You’ve entangled with more people, you have the start of an entangled village here. We’ve met Alton and we both can build on that. And I’ve got my Civilization Project, which may yet tell us something useful.”
“The awkward little Black Chinese girl and the dreamy underachieving software writer with migraines — no one would guess that we’re changing the world.”
“Trying at least.

            <Text>Very long distance romance
March 19, 2049
Raefe hadn’t heard from Lina in three weeks. At first, he chalked it up to her being out in the bush somewhere around Kilunga. A quick look at the satmaps showed there was, indeed, a lot of bush around Kilunga and little else. But if he’d woken up worried, he was beside himself now. He’d gotten a message from her mother, who had heard through the Chinese government that she had escaped a kidnapping and was safe, but now somewhere in the bush.
It was almost 6 months now since he had been with her, in their other life, on that island, minutes from death. How had they let it go this long and not found a way to get together? He closed the window shade, turned off the room light. He folded his bed back into a couch and sat on the edge, as quiet and still as he could. He closed his eyes and thought of her face. A moment from when they had just met returned, one of the few memories he had of that life that was older than a year. They were sitting at a coffee cart in Union Square; he couldn’t quite remember the name. It was a beautiful spring day and the coffee exploded in his mouth in a shower of bitter, chocolate, and molasses foam. He smiled and she laughed. Her face filled his mind’s eye — her anarchic curls, her cinammon skin, the slightly square nose that seemed neither African or Chinese — and a fountain of longing burst from inside him toward the sky.
And then he felt something back. A brush of fingertips raising the hair on the back of his neck. A whisper in his ear making him alert. A keening. And then it was gone.
He sat frozen, afraid to move even a millimeter. After a minute or two, he felt the desperation of knowing she might not come back and a cry flew out from inside him. Had he actually shouted it, or was it just in his head? He wasn’t sure.
“Raefe, are you OK?”
Who was it? A woman’s voice, not Lina’s. A neighbor?
“Can you hear me?”
It was Aleron.
“Yes, I forget sometimes you can come when I’m awake. You heard me crying out?”
“I heard both of you.”
“You heard Lina?”
“Yes, she heard you but could not hold on to your thoughts.”
“Wow, I didn’t expect her empathic powers to be that strong. I was really just reaching out in desperation, no expectations.”
“You both are much stronger now. Empathy builds its own strength.”
“You have to tell me — is she OK?”
“Yes, tired but safe. She can tell you all about it.”
“I don’t think I can wait until I see her. I’m going crazy here.”
“I will find her and connect you,” realizing in that moment that this was what Salmerikon had done on Truro Island. Yes, but I am only strengthening an existing entanglement, not rewiring someone’s brain without their knowledge. Yet she realized she would do exactly that in this moment if that was what it would take to keep Raefe going. I am no better than Salmerikon, it would seem.
Only a few seconds later, Raefe felt another mind. He had never experienced more than his one to ones with Aleron. It took him a second to tease out the two streams. Now he could sense Lina, and his head was filled with warm light. He had a million questions and he sensed that so did she. He tried to speak, but he felt her thoughts flooding into his mind and great streams of ideas flowing out of him toward her. Seconds, minutes, many minutes — he had no idea — passed and then he felt his mind settle.
“I will leave you now,” Aleron said. “I think you have much to say to each other and little to me.”

February 21, 2049
Lina was glad to put Kiunga behind her. As beautiful as the coast was, she was only helping to destroy it. As cloistered as their life in Shanzu had been, here she felt not only isolated but alone. It would be good to feel the bustle of Mombasa, spend time with her family, look up some of her friends from school and see how they were doing.
After awhile, the town gave way to the countryside. The road became less formal, and by the time they turned right toward Mararani, it was hard track but flat and in good shape. There was little but savannah in every direction, quiet as the heat began to rise in late morning. Still, the two Chinese guards in the front of the bus had their rifles at the ready in case raiders from Somalia struck. With the Coastal Friendship Alliance logo on it, they would know it was likely to be all Chinese passengers. For some, that meant “Stay away.” For others, it advertised “People with money onboard.””
She thought of what she would say to her father when she got home. She knew that it was not really his decision to send her to the port construction project. He just couldn’t bring himself to admit that he couldn’t protect her from his superiors. Since she had gained her empathic powers, she had seen much more deeply into the complex web of emotions that was her father. He had given up a lot to marry her mother, and their Milima was a concrete reminder of his dalliance with an African. She knew that sometimes he wanted to tell the Coastal Friendship Alliance to drop dead, but each time, he could not see how that would make their life better. He felt they wouldn’t be accepted by the locals and they’d have no protection from the Chinese.
He was in a tough spot. She thought he underestimated the Kenyans. After all, people of all sorts had passed through here for as long as there had been people. But it would require him to not just leave the CFA, but to leave behind his Chinese identity. As much as the CFA questioned that he still had one, she knew that he was deeply invested in his heritage. So when they had suggested that his daughter could continue her computer studies by working on the harbor project, he could not refuse. That much she had sensed from him.
Still, gouging out one of the world’s last remaining viable reef systems to build oil rigs and a deep water port was not something she could do. She could still remember her teeth vibrating deep into her skull that day on the other Earth as the whole ground and the air around them began to hum with the approach of that impossibly huge wall of water. If you saw something like that once, you simply couldn’t be part of it happening again. Not that she could tell him that.
Her thoughts were interrupted by a loud noise as the right front tire blew out. The driver struggled for control, bringing the vehicle to a halt with front wheel in a ditch, but the bus still upright. No one was hurt.
The  guards were on their radios — there was no mobile service out here. She couldn’t hear them, but their faces were enough to tell her that all was not well. She could feel their fear. One of them motioned toward to come to the front. Puzzled, she walked to the front.
“Miss Yang?”
“Yes?”
“Captain Li in Kiunga would like to talk to you.”
She took the radio. The guard pointed to the large button on the side and then his mouth. She pressed the button.
“Captain Li?”
“Miss Yang, thank you. We need your assistance. According to our records, you speak Swahili?”
“Yes, I do.”
“Very good. The bus is disabled and it will be some time before we can send a vehicle to replace it. There is a village called Mangai about a kilometer from where you are. We would like all the passengers to walk there with the guards. When we get there, can you translate for the guards? We only want to let the locals know that we mean no harm and ask for their help for a few hours.””
So they must be in an area that was not totally secure.
“I hope so, Captain. I speak Mombasa Swahili. It’s like Chinese, you know — the vowels are sung. Up here in the North, they don’’t. I suppose it’s like the difference between Chinese and Japanese. But I think I can make myself understood and understand them. That’s sort of the point of Swahili.”
“Thank you. We will send help as soon as we can.”
There were about 20 of them altogether, and they set out walking in the direction they had been driving. The land on either side of the road was grassy, with occasional small groups of antelope or deer. Farther off the road, they could see that the trees thickened on both sides. There were no signs of people anywhere that Lina could see. But after a half hour, she saw smoke rising in the distance. One of the guards had binoculars and told them it was a village.
As they walked around a bend in the road, there were four Kenyans in the road. Two men, a woman and a boy. They were trying to shout something in Chinese, but no one could understand them. Lina walked ahead, waving in the way that Kenyans did so that they could see she was a local.
“Hello. Our bus is broken,” she said in her singing Swahili. “May we stay in your village until help comes this afternoon?”” Closer now, she could see the people wore the gauzey white pantaloons and tunics of the local Muslim tribes. The woman had a blue print scarf  covering her hair.
“You are welcome to stay,” the woman said in her flat Northern accent. “It will be safer for you. I am Imani. These are my brothers, Juma, Kamari and little Rashid.”” Lina suspected that they would not speak directly to her, as an unaccompanied woman.
“Thank you. I am Milima Kawambai Yang. Safe from what?” she asked.
“Shabab,” she said plainly. “They claim all of Lamu is part of the East African Caliphate. What you call Somalia.”
She wondered if her father knew that the Chinese government was investing in a war zone. It was news to her.
“I didn’t know they were here. Do they come often?”
“Now and then. You should tell your friends to put their guns away. If any Shabab see Chinese with guns, they may think they are soldiers and attack them. They are not happy about Chinese coming here.”
Lina told the guards, but she knew they would not put away their rifles. Juma and Kamari led all the passengers into the village, a jumble of old-style huts and cinder-block buildings. Past the village were fields where they tended  small herds of goats and cattle, as well as a large garden.
Imani brought them all to small pavilion in the center of the village. Some long tables sat under a tent-like covering, the sides open.
“You can stay here until your people come,” she said. “The elders will come to meet you soon.”
Lina explained what was going on to her fellow travelers. The group was tense, anxious for help to come from Kiunga. But with her new abilities, she could also sense anger — some of the group was feeling that they had been sent into danger haphazardly, their safety unimportant. 
Knowing that deep dissatisfaction lurked underneath some of that smugness pleased her. She could not remember her childhood in her other life, but nonetheless she felt sure that must have been her exasperation with the smugness of her father’s people that had driven her to America. She shrugged the feeling off. Maybe she had as many pasts as futures, but those pasts were hidden from her. They couldn’t help her now. 
The guards thanked her for her translation and introduced themselves. Zhang Lei was short and stocky, with bad skin and a squint. Wang Tao was taller and leaner, with a wry smile.
“Do you live here in Kiunga?” Lina asked. “I haven’t seen you around.””
“No, you wouldn’t,” Wang answered. “There is a small military base south of Kiunga, just past Rubu. We stay there.”
“Oh, I hadn’t realized you were in the army,” she said.
“That is good,” Wang answered. “Our commander prefers us to appear as civilian security guards. He says that we work under the Light Footprint policy.””
“What is that?”
“Foreign Minister Wei Peng has said that when we Chinese come to other countries with food and technology in our arms, our feet should not disturb the ground our hosts walk on. In this way, we bring improvement without disturbance.”
Unless the disturbance is below the water, she thought bitterly. But she detected not a hint of irony in either of the soldiers, and bit her tongue.
*********************
Lina had gotten used to the quiet nights of Kiunga, but Mianga was in another league entirely. Near midnight, almost everyone was asleep. She could hear a video faintly off to her right, and muffled conversation somewhere behind her. But all around her was the sound of birds, frogs, insects and the occasional growl of some sort of big cat. Before turning in, she had walked to the edge of the village. Looking up, the inky river of the Milky Way was as vivid as she had ever seen it. Every so often, a meteorite streaked across the sky. She wondered where in that sky Salmerikon lived.
Now, lying on the cot Imani had set up for her, she allowed herself to remember what it had felt like when Raefe and Salmerikon had together touched her mind. It had all happened so quickly and she usually forced herself not to dwell on it. Raefe had become something of a ghost to her. They had worked a scheme to chat on a popular site, but she only did that from net cafes in Mombasa. A direct vid call was too risky. How would she explain him to her parents? Her father’s bosses might read something sinister into a relationship with an American, given the two country’s uneasy coexistence. But here in the bush, remembering the vastness of the cosmos, she could feel the power that her mind was still growing into. In high school, she had been on the track team. She remembered the feeling of lacing up her shoes, stretching her hamstrings, exploding out of the blocks, and that glorious rush as her head came up and the track was hers. The sky, the village, the villagers — they felt a little like that track had.
Her cosmic musings led her deeper into her mind, and soon, she was asleep. Suddenly, she someone was shaking her.
“Wake up, we have to go!”
It was Imani.
“Hurry, Shabab is coming! We must leave.”
Lina grabbed the gym bag with her things, stepped into her shoes and hustled out into the deep night, joining a stream of villagers. They were trotting down a path leading away from the village toward the forest. No one talked. She could feel that they had practiced this, perhaps actually had to flee before. She felt their fear, but also their determination, and a kind of pride that they were doing this together.
She tried to ask Imani where they were going, but got only a sharp look and a finger to the lips for her trouble. It slowly dawned on her that she was the only person from the bus in the column. As they continued their escape, she lost the thread of feeling the other Chinese travelers. For now, she was an African, jogging for her life with two hundred other men, women and children. After nearly an hour, they stopped.
An older man, seemingly the leader of the village, quietly directed several younger men to act as sentries. They fanned out, each stepping just off the track into the forest so as not to be seen.
“Here, have some water,” Imani said, offering her a water bottle.
“Thanks,” Lina answered. “And thanks for waking me up.”
“I couldn’t leave you there.”
“But you left the other Chinese travelers.”
“Shabab will hold them for ransom, or to extract something from the Chinese government. If they get what they want, they will let them go. But you…”
“Because of my hair, and my darker skin?”
Imani hesitated. Lina grasped her discomfort.
“Oh, of course. They would think that I am the child of a prostitute and therefore worthless for anything but rape.”
Imani’s face betrayed her surprise at Lina’s insight. “Yes. They rape us too, but for other reasons. To show our men that they are powerless against them. And they would take some of us back to Somalia as so-called wives.”
“But you are all Muslim, I don’t understand.”
“All their praise of Allah is garbage,” she growled. “They are bandits. When the UN set up drone planes and submarines in 2042 and finally made it hard for them to be pirates, they turned their eyes away from the sea. Now they kidnap and steal.”
“And Nairobi? They don’t help?”
“They are the government. They don’t need to kidnap to steal. As long as Shabab doesn’t send too many soldiers, as long as they only prey on small villages and leave the cities to the government, the army would rather spend its money on itself.”
“So you come here and hide for a few days and go back?”
“No. The construction project as Kiunga has changed everything. For Shabab, this is a giant opportunity. Many foreigners to kidnap. Money to demand from the government to leave the foreigners alone. People will hear about how Shabab stood up to the Chinese and the government, and that will help them get more young people to join their army. Shabab means ‘‘youth’ but they have grown old and need young blood now. They will not leave us alone in Mianga. We go deep into the forest. There are people who will take us in.”
Water break was over. The group resumed their double time march in silence broken only by soft whispers to “pay attention” to the sounds of large animals in the forest on either side of the track. The children were now in the center of the column, the younger ones on the backs of the largest men, the older ones able to run and keep up. For the big cats in the forest, probably leopards, the whole group of them must have looked like a dangerous herd. Apart from the occasional growl or strong scent of musk, potential predators were invisible.
Daylight revealed that they had been running along a slight ridge, perhaps 10 meters higher than the land around it. They were walking now. One of the women had a sat phone with a GPS. They could all see that they had put about 20 kilometers between themselves and their village. Several people huddled around the phone talking and Lina could make out that they were looking for high ground to reconnoiter. The woman pointed to a fork in the track ahead, and they took the right-hand path. A short time later, they found themselves on a bald, rocky hill. Without the trees to block their view, the high point gave them a view in every direction.
Looking northward, the forest sloped downward for half a kilometer. Beyond that, there were grasslands as far as the eye could see. The view to the south was different. A kilometer or two away, something more than a stream and less than a big river meandered westward as far as the eye could see. Lina could make out a small lake, a pond really, in the distance. For a second, she thought she saw a flash of light from the woods on the far northern edge of the lake. South of the river, the forest continued unabated but seemed to change color in the distance. 
She borrowed binoculars from one of the sentries. The color change marked different, denser forest. Probably the northern edge of the coastal mangroves, she thought. Sweeping back toward the lake, she could see flashes of movement at the far end of the lake and a variety of small structures. Perhaps she had seen sunlight reflected of one of the metal huts.
The group continued their march, now a brisk walk, headed toward the lake. Everyone was ore relaxed now, talking, trying to make the best of it. But no one would tell her anything about where they were going other than, “you’ll see, you’ll like it.” She thought about asking the woman with the sat phone if she could use it to call her parents, but what did she have to tell them at this point? She was sure they were headed for that lake, but she’d wait until they got there.
They had descended into the forest again, unable to gauge their progress. Just before 3 in the afternoon, they emerged into a large clearing, filled with dozens of  small buildings. There seemed to be three or four hundred people about, busily going about their day. No one seemed surprised by their arrival. Lina guessed that a sat call had been made.
The Mangai villagers were met by a group of people who seemed to know some of them and greeted them warmly. Imani took Lina to what looked to be a dining area — tables under a canopy — in the center of the village. A tall, reedy, cinnamon-colored woman came to greet them.
“Welcome,” she said in Swahili. “I am Edna. I speak for the village council. You must be Imani. And you must be Millima. Please, sit. We have some water for you. Are you hungry?””
“Yes, indeed,” Imani said. “We left in the deep of the night and had no time for food.”
Edna waved to some young men near the tent and asked them to bring food. “We will have a proper feast for you later, but we have some left over lunch for you now.”
Lina was impatient. “What is this place?”
Edna smiled. “It is Kakuma.”
Lina laughed at the Swahili word for nowhere. “Well, I never saw it on any map, but really, where am I?”
“I will explain,” Edna said. “But first, the council has asked me to discuss your situation with you. Shabab has taken your fellow passengers on the bus hostage. They’ve presented demands for money to return them. Are any of the hostages your friends or family?”
“No, I’ve only just arrived in Kiunga. My family is in Mombasa.”
“How is it you came here to work for the Chinese?”
“My father is Chinese. He works as an engineer for the Coastal Friendship Alliance — do you know what that is? —  in Mombasa.””
“So your father works for the CFA?”
 “Ah, so you know them. His bosses suggested that my college studies would be more effective if I put my learning to use on the project in Kiunga.”
“So your father is not very high up in CFA?”
Lina laughed. This one was sharp. “No, not at all. Why do you ask?”
“You will be reported missing. What happens next could depend on who you are, who your family is.”
“Huh, I hadn’t even thought of that. I was actually hoping to contact my family when we reached here. Just to let them know I’m okay.””
“You can do that in a little while. But we have to discuss what happens after that — will you go back to Kiunga, to Mombasa, to somewhere else? We have to figure out how to do that without endangering this village.”
“I don’t understand.”
“When I said you are in Nowhere, I was not playing with words. Nowhere is not just our village, but our country. Look around you carefully. What do you notice about the people here?”
There looked to be about 400 people in the village. They definitely weren’t one ethnic group — the people were of many shades and shapes. The closer she looked, though, she couldn’’t recognize for certain any one ethnic group she was familiar with. They wore a mix of traditional clothing from several ethnic groups and even a bit of Western clothing.
“There are many kinds of people here, but it is hard to identify their ethnic group by clothing or hair or jewelry.”
“I am very impressed that a foreigner would notice that,” Edna said.
“I am not a foreigner. I was born here. My mother’s name is Sauda Kawambai. As you can see, I speak Swahili like any Mombassa girl.” But she had a feeling that Edna knew that.
“And yet you are Chinese.”
“Look, what’s this all about? Right now, I’m just a person.”
Edna beamed at her. “Yes, right now, you are like us. Citizens of Nowhere.”
“You mean…”
“Yes, most of us have been driven out of our homes by soldiers, bandits, pirates. Most of those who drove us out did so under the banners of country or faith. Or progress, like your father’s countrymen. And the people who had protected us before that, it was the same. Always two sides, always life and death which side you belong to.”
“And you have not chosen sides?”
“We have chosen our side. The side of people, living life. Together.”
Lina stilled her mind and let the woman’s words wash over her. She could find no deception or irony or self-delusion in the woman’s thoughts. This was what she believed, for sure.
“Cool.”
Edna laughed. “Everyone will be very happy to know that we are cool.”
“No, I mean it. I have lived what you described. My parents love each other, they are not at war. But I have been a battlefield for their cultures, who each see me as a traitor. Almond eyes, kinky hair, thin lips, skin like neither. I never heard of Nowhere. But I have been called No One, in so many words, for as long as I remember.”
“Maybe the don’t see you as a traitor, but as a living example that no one group is better than another. So they make your life hard to prove that it is easier to be one of them.”
“Yes, I fear you are right.”
“But the world has changed, and it is not easier to be one of them, whatever that means. Here in Africa, we should know that better than anyone. The first people lived here — I mean right here — more than 150,000 years ago, and the people who came before the first people, too. They left behind forests like these, and grasslands like the ones around Mangai, and walked along the coast line your project is destroying, living on shell fish, and walked all the way to Asia, and later to Europe and America. Many thousands of years later, their descendants returned here, as if they remembered the richness of the place. And they began the great mixing. I am from Ethiopia —— in my face you can see Arabs who returned to Africa many times over thousands of years. You can see the Hindus who came here to trade. The British, the French, just as I can see the Chinese in your face. Now, the whole world is churning, all its peoples mixing. All this fighting over “them”” and “us” — you might as well fight a typhoon!”
Lina shuddered, the memory of the hurricanes from her old world suddenly alive. She could feel Edna’s passion, and glimpsed her concern.
“Still, how do you keep all of that out of here?”
“We do what we can. When people come here, they must leave certain things outside. Whatever they believe in their heart, there is no room here for superiority. No religion is better, no nationality, ethnicity, class. Whatever it is they remember fondly about their old life, they must share. They must cook a meal, celebrate a holiday, wear a certain color —— and for those  for whom this is not our tradition, we must partake with an open heart.”
Lina was impressed at the idea, and she could also feel Edna’s pride. “Really cool!”
They both laughed.
“What is it you want to do, Millima,” Edna asked, her expression now serious. “Do you want to go back to Kiunga or to Mombasa?””
Lina scanned the village, noticing more details about the people. She saw now that there was a deliberate mixing of styles, as if the people of East Africa had had a big swap meet and exchanged fashions. She touched their minds as best she could. There was nothing special she could detect, except perhaps a quiet confidence. A calm.
“Maybe, yeah, I don’t really know.” she answered. “Can I stay here, at least for awhile? If I could just let my parents know I’m ok, I’d love to stay. I can work, I’m not just a student. I’ll earn my keep.”
“You can stay as long as you like. After a week, you must decide if this is for you, and if it is, you must agree to our ways. We have our rituals, too. We can talk about that. As for your parents, we can get word to them. But they cannot know our location. No matter what you intend, the Chinese will put pressure on them and they will send helicopters and soldiers to rescue you. Nowhere will then be Somewhere, and it will no longer be our home.”
“How do you keep it a secret? Don’t people leave on their own?”
“Yes, they do. We have our ways of remaining hidden, though. All in due time.”
They move, Lina could sense the answer in Edna. Nowhere can be anywhere. They must do it every now and then, and very carefully.
“You can get word to my parents soon?”
“Yes. Imani’s village will return. We have made a deal with Shabab. The villagers won’t tell the Chinese where to find Shabab, and Shabab will leave them alone. We have a special relationship with Mangai village — our secret is safe with them. One of them will let your parents know that you are safe.”
“And what about the people from my bus?”
“That will have to play out between the Chinese and Shabab.”
She knows they will be killed, Lina thought. Shabab already knows the CFA won’t ransom the bus travelers. They were all low-level workers, except for the two soldiers. And they sealed their fate by not dying defending the bus.
This is what I died for, she thought. What I gave up Raefe for, what Salmerikon changed me for. To learn what it feels like to put aside hatred and fear, to join with ordinary people. This is a start. My parents will be hurt, but I cannot change that my life will always bring one or another of them some pain and regret. Let it at least mean something.
“I sense that you are thinking very deeply about this,” Edna said. “I want to say that we would be very happy to have some one such as you who can bring us experiences and knowledge from places we have never had the chance to go. But I also want to say that you must not think of this as some kind of sacrifice, some kind of martyrdom.”
Lina was startled. Now it was Edna who seemed to be reading her mind. “I confess, you are not far off what I was thinking. What should I think of this as?”
“As a decision you can make, or not. Many people take a new name when they join us, to signify leaving behind the names that mark their family and clan and culture. I took the name Edna. In my language, it means rebirth. For me, this is both a new way of life and actually an entire new life itself. Like a butterfly from a cocoon.”
“Let me spend a week in your cocoon. Then let’s see where I will fly.”

            <Title>New K attacks</Title>
            <Text>Shit, Raefe thought, we’re not ready yet!
He had definitely felt something probing Nila’s mind. Some thing, too, not someone. He had tangled with aliens across the galaxy, and thousands of people at once many times. But he had never felt a thing, not a living thing, some kind of machine, in the waveform. It was a harsh sensation, broad and unfocused, gritty and irritating. He had a sudden memory of being a little boy and getting sand in his bathing suit, having to ride home feeling it chafe him. This was the mental equivalent of sand in your crotch.
He found Des and played him back the sensation.
“Oh, man, that’s ugly!” Des said. “Your thinking this was some kind of scan New Kendall was doing to find tanglers?”
“No idea,” he said. “All of a sudden I could feel it brushing up against her mind. It wasn’t strong, though. I think they weren’t close. Tosh is going out to pick her up and bring her to Cambridge. I don’t think she’ll be safe in New K. My gut tells me they are going to try and take any tanglers off the board up there, at least the ones who don’t work directly in this covert op.”
“If you put a few people along the border, widely spaced, and they can sense what you did, we may be able to triangulate where they are, and how many.”
Raefe relayed the thought to Alyn, who lead their informal security force. Usually they just dealt with local people who were having a crisis and acting violently or dangerously. He’d have to brief her soon, but for now, they could monitor things.,
“And what do we do if they come across the river?” Raefe said.
“That’s the thing. They may not need to — they may be able to project from where they are. I think that’s what those helmets are for, to amplify and direct their thoughts. We’ve been working on countermeasures here. Some require hardware and we don’t have time for it. But we can also fight them by having multiple people focus their thoughts on the tanglers from New K and messing with them in certain ways. It will at least neutralize their attempts to fry people’s brains.”
“That would be good,” Raefe said. “What do we need to do?”
“For now, just make sure you have maybe 20 tanglers ready. I have to figure a few last things out but I should only need an hour. Then I can download the whole concept to all of you.”
“I hope we have an hour,” Raefe said.
“Me, too,” Des said. “Meanwhile, stay off the main waveform. Did you show Tosh what you showed me?”
“Yeah, he got it right away,” Raefe said.
“Good. Just communicate that way for now. He can relay to other people on the main waveform if needed. I doubt they know his signature.”
Raefe didn’t need an hour. When it came down to it, as soon as word got out that he might be in danger, nearly everyone in Cambridge who could entangle was available. Tosh created a central core of the 20 people Des had wanted, but they each were connected to many more people, thousands in all.
But it was little more than an hour before the attack happened. Raefe began to feel something probing him. It wasn’t quite like when someone tried to find him to communicate — there was something more one-sided and blunt about it. But, yes, someone or something wanted to find his mind’s signature. 
Only it wasn’t really a two way street. Raefe had already let Tosh know on their side channel. Tosh watched and felt, too, that this new vibration in the waveform was odd, but strong. And then, suddenly, it began to ramp up.
“They’ve found me,” Raefe said to Tosh. “Time for Des’s protocols.”
Raefe let the energy from the attacker flow through him to group of 20. Des had described to them how they could engage the attacker, reflect their energy back to them. They felt the attacker flinch and fall back. But minutes later, the attack resumed, now with a dozen attackers. It was Raefe could do to funnel the energy. More attackers came on, and Raefe struggled.
Then he felt another mind alongside his, a friendly one, imitating his signature. And then another, and another. Soon a few dozen minds, none he recognized immediately, were drawing off the initial attacks and funneling them to ever more people. New Kendall threw more attackers in, but to no avail. In what seemed like an eternity but was only five minutes, the Cambridge entanglers had exhausted New Kendall’s hit squad. They left the waveform abruptly.
For the first time in many years, Raefe felt thousands of people joined together, celebrating. The waveform swelled with the joy of a common victory.
“Thank you all!” Raefe broadcast. “I know that most of you are unknown to me. Today New Kendall tried to turn our empathy against us, to use machines to overload us and, literally, to fry our brains. You were all brilliant. Some of you did things I didn’t know could be done. New Kendall will be back, of course, but for now, we have shown them that in empathy, there is strength. Most of all, we have reminded ourselves of that.”
“Not just empathy,” a voice replied. It was Ines, from Norcamb. “Community, too. We join your sound, we create something more than one person can do, no matter how loud.   They can’t handle that noise.”
Raefe had not realized that it was people outside of Everywhere who had turned the tide. He realized that he had stopped thinking of Everywhere as everyone years ago, that he had lost hope for it spreading much farther.
“Yes, Everywhere, we all look up, but it’s not for everyone,” Ines said just to him. “Dance this moment we’re all together. We look deep into it later — much to talk about.”
He felt the thousands of people all around him, reveling in the first day of good news in many days. He felt their pride and determination. He remembered how it had felt in Dadaab, all those years ago, the same mixture of empathy and hope. That was the thing about empathy — connection and misery could amplify the misery, sometimes. Connection and hope, though, was a powerful brew. There was much to explore here.
The waveform slowly returned to its normal buzz as people went back to their daily lives. He reached out secretly to Des.
“You watched all of that?”
“Indeed,” Des said. “It was much more effective than I had hoped. None of our people were hurt.”
“And New K?”
“We’re getting mixed signals,” Des said. “I think some of their equipment overloaded. Maybe some of their people, too. I think they’re trying to sort that out. It may be some time before they understand what happened to them — but we’ll keep monitoring.”
“But will they take this as a warning or a challenge?” Raefe asked.
“Yeah, that’s the question. And something new happened with us, didn’t it?”
“Yes, and not from Everywhere. Some of the fugees who tangle have evidently learned skills we don’t have. They’ve been in touch — they want to talk.”
“That’s exciting! You’ve not had the best of relations with them, eh?” Des asked.
“But not the worst, either,” Raefe said. “Maybe there can be a meeting of the minds, pun intended.”
“Indeed,” Des laughed.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Aleron reveals herself to Raefe</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 9

Raefe stared out of the window at the snow, falling for the third straight day. The morning blizzard had eased up to a light fall as the backside of the storm circled through. They’d get a few hours of sun now before the ‘soon swirled back fresh with frozen moisture from the ocean.
He thought of the snow crew on the train ride, probably exhausted after the last three weeks of this, lying alongside a road somewhere, trying to catch a little nap before the next storm wave hit. They’d work almost around the clock for the snow ‘soon season, piling up as much money as they could. Then they’d head on to the next migrant jobs they could find. What a life!
He read a class assignment with no particular enthusiasm. He remembered a character in an old vid saying “I’m putting this town in my rear view,” and that’’s what where his classes seemed focused on. It was interesting, in an abstract sort of way. But everything was different now, and would be different tomorrow. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if the people of the past had that much to offer, why was he living through mass extinctions, endless wars around the world, corpos corrupting every government to their own ends, and the possibility of total disaster looming?
But if he flunked out of Human Potential 221, he’d be in danger of losing his scholarship. And if he lost that, he’d be out on the street, and then he’d become a snow monkey or something equally undesirable. There was always something worse, he was discovering.
He turned back to his screen, trying to focus on this rather abstruse lecture on “Cooperation versus competition in pre-electronic societies.” He listened for the third time, trying to understand what was really different about back then, trying to picture a world where you mostly had to be face to face with people to see what they really looked like and sounded like. Was there any type of person on earth he had not seen or heard on the ‘net? He tried to imagine different variables – tallest, shortest, fattest, thinnest, palest, darkest, hair, eyes –– what a motley bunch we all were. He turned up the Carnival music coming out of Rio on the Net and closed his eyes and tried to picture them. 
There was a long line of odd looking people, sambaing toward him. He danced down the line, shaking each person’s hand, asking their name and where they were from. Olaf, the Viking pirate, Norumbega, dives for pearls, on down the line he went until he came to a woman who looked nothing like anyone he had ever met.
She was more than 2 meters tall, but there was something about the way her shoulders, hips and feet formed a long, sinuous arce that was as striking as her height. At first she looked white, but then he realized she had a faint violet glow about her, as if lit from within. She had long black hair, but it too had a faint purplish tinge. And her eyes could only be called fuchsia.
“Who are you,” he asked her.
“I’m Aleron. I’m glad we are finally getting to meet, Raefe.”
“How do you know my name?”
“I became interested in you some time ago, and I’ve been learning about you.”
“What? Why would be watching me?”
“I’m going to tell you that. Let’s go sit over here.” She waved toward a small grove, with a little curved bench big enough for the both of them. There was a slight breeze that kept the trees tilting this way and that in a quiet rustle. Overhead, the sky was blue with tufty cotton clouds. The Carnival music had disappeared.
She sat across from him and laid her hands on top of his. They seemed weightless yet warm. She closed her eyes and without thinking, so did he.
A second went by and then he felt a sensation that he had never felt before, as if the two of them were passing by each other, no more like through each other, as if they each were a school of fish swimming at right angles to each other without touching. Startled, he opened his eyes. She was smiling at him.
“There, now we are more firmly linked,” she said.
“Linked to what?”
“To each other.”
He looked down. She wasn’t touching him anymore but he still had that feeling.
“You have many questions and some of the answers will be hard for you to understand or believe. So let me start with the biggest news. My name is Aleron, as I said, but I am not human. Nor am I actually here. I live on a planet my kind call A’Nonto – it means Red Flower in your language –– around a star more than 20 light years from you.”
“And you’ve travelled here to see me? Why”
“No, I have not travelled to your world. It would take many lifetimes to travel to your world. But like many other intelligent species, after thousands of years of watching the stars and trying to understand the universe, we have found ways to send signals vast distances through shortcuts in the universe. I believe in your culture, these are called wormholes. Unlike some of your more imaginative entertainment, living things, nor any other objects of any size, cannot go through wormholes. But energy – information --  can.”
“So, you’re just some kind of holo vid?”
“Not exactly. Perhaps you will take a course in your school that goes deeper into physics and it will become easier for you to understand. But the basic idea is that when the big bang happened, what was once a mass of energy, all interacting in a single waveform, flew outward and cooled and separated into the universe we see. But subtle connections remain between matter that once was connected, subtle pathways for waves to form. Your physicists call this quantum entanglement, although they are far from understanding how it works. We have learned how to travel those pathways and strengthen them, even across wormholes. So right now, my brain and your brain are having a conversation over these many light years because we are entangled with each other.”
“How did this happen? Did someone plant a chip in me?”
She smiled. “No, you have a great gift. All living things sense entanglement to some degree – we all have atoms and even smaller particles that condensed out of the primordial bang and this creates a very low level field that we mostly aren’t aware of. You and I, and many, many others, are creatures who somehow concentrate this entanglement more than our fellow beings. We are not sure why or how. But we know it’s true and have been meeting living creatures throughout the galaxy this way for thousands of years. And before us, for more than a billion years, other creatures have been doing the same.”
“I don’t know what to say. I don’t feel particularly special. I’m just a kid who gets headaches, sometimes daydreams too much, and is struggling to get through college. Sometimes I feel like I want to do something big, but I don’t think even I believe that I will, and I know no one else does. I’m one of those people other people say ‘‘nice guy, not too ambitious, a little dreamy’ about.”
“Your headaches and daydreams are a symptom of your gift, and of your inability to channel it. I will help you with that in time. As for the rest, I think you are going to do big things.”
Raefe felt like a guitar string that had been plucked and couldn’t stop vibrating. Her words were like a song playing in his head. Did she feel his thoughts in the same way?
“Yes, that’s exactly it,” she smiled. “I do feel your thoughts that way. In time, it will seem unremarkable to you and you will begin to notice that from other people in your world, too.”
“Maybe I have already. Sometimes I meet someone and I have this vague sense of a kind of static electricity between us.”
“Excellent! You are on your way.”
“To what?”
“Now I have to tell you some hard things, and ask your help.”
For the first time, he felt fear. He looked around. They were in this little woods, all alone. There were no buildings on the horizon. Where was he? Could he leave if he wanted?
“You can relax, Raefe. You are asleep. When you wake up, you will remember this, and you will be free to do whatever you want. For now, let me explain some things. Is that OK?”
“Yes, I want to hear what you have to say. Or think, or whatever it is we are doing.”
“Your scientists have made great strides in the last few generations and found many planets outside your star system, including some that they think might have life. Including, actually, my planet, but that’s a story for another day. My species discovered these things about 10,000 years ago and for many generations, we made plans to roam the galaxy to look for intelligent life. But ultimately, we realized that this is unlikely in the ordinary way. The galaxy, let alone the universe, is vast and empty. There is life everywhere, including intelligent life, but the distances are too great. Ultimately, we learned that living things have been trying for more than 3 billion years to bridge these distances.
“Like you, we had many forms of speculation about traveling faster than light, and making instant trips to other civilizations. Alas, after 3 billion years, no living things have solved that puzzle. But, like others before us, we learned more about the quantum world and learned to exploit certain phenomenon, to be able to send energy through wormholes. And then we learned to organize that energy in certain ways so that we could have useful communications with other lifeforms.
“What we discovered is that there is a loose association of advanced lifeforms called Guardians who speak to each other across these wormhole links. While life is plentiful, even intelligent life, it is sparse. And frail. Many intelligent species destroy themselves, many others are destroyed by random events, like the comet that helped destroy the dinosaurs on your world. They, by the way, might have become as intelligent as your species, so you see how it goes.
“So I am a Guardian, and I am working to nurse your species through its most dangerous epoch. You see it all around you – your species has developed great destructive power. You could wipe yourself out in a day with nuclear weapons. Right now, you are wiping yourselves out with a slower destruction of your environment. You have learned a great deal about the natural world, and can manipulate it for both productive and destructive purposes. Yet you know very little, yet, about yourselves. About how your own minds work, and how to steer them to avoid these calamities.”
“Wow, you can say that again. That’s all we seem to do – mess things up and then talk about why and how. But we never seem to change much. What can we do?””
“I can’t tell you that. Both because I don’t know – every species must find its own way – and because Guardians have discovered the hard way that accelerating your development through giving you extensive knowledge of discoveries you are millennia from reaching on your own never works. Ultimately, your knowledge of yourselves and the physical universe must develop in a new way, in a more linked way,  that you will have to find on your own.””
“And you want me to do that? Are you kidding? I never got past the basics in science. I’m more of a poet than a physicist.”
She smiled. “No, Raefe, the future of humanity is not your responsibility alone. But you already feel that you want to do something with your life, you want to find new answers, maybe even new questions. I know you have shared these thoughts with your mate, and so they must be important to you?”
“Yes, I have thought about those things. Lina and I have had some very odd experiences lately, and we met some interesting people. But I really have no plan.”
“One of those people you met was Alton Winchester. Like you, he is an entangler – I think you sensed that.”
“I did! It was weird. You know about our train trip?”
“Yes.”
“Him and that ridiculous Jefferson Davis character. I felt it from both of them.”
She considered that for a second. “I have not felt Davis. I will give that some thought. Winchester, he is not far enough along as you to contact. But he is doing good things. You should follow your instincts and meet him and talk. There are others – you will learn better to identify them, and I will also point some out to you.”
“Seems kind of creepy, like I’m putting together some kind of sleeper cell for aliens.”
“You will have to judge our motives and actions for yourself. But my goals isn’t to have you carry out some plot. These people who are entanglers, they connect with other People in different ways. They sense different parts of what ultimately will be a solution for your species. My only goal is to connect you with each other, so that you can begin that work yourself.
“Right now, there is some urgency. Your species has a good chance of self-destruction in your lifetime. Change is not simple in your world.”
“Well, I was going to visit Alton anyway, so no worries there. Can I tell him about you?”
“I would advise against it. I think you understand on a very basic level that if you discuss this with others, the issue will become your sanity, not the substance of what it is to be done. For others, the narrative will come too close to religion, and they will become passive, thinking that the Guardians will save them as some kind of gods. In billions of years, intelligent life has never found gods. If they exist, they hide well. Although we also still cannot explain some aspects of how the universe works, gods have little to do in our worldview. So you should probably think of me as a muse, a source of inspiration, that you meet in dreams.”
“Ah, so this is a dream?”
“Yes, for now, that is how we will meet. But you will remember all of it. And now, I will show you how to deal with those headaches.”
He felt a warmth, as if a tiny river of honey was flowing from one part of his head (or was it just his mind) to another. He understood that he could turn that flow on next time he felt that migraine-like headache, and it would soothe it. He smiled. This was going to be alright.</Text>

            <Text>Meet the new boss
Lina woke him before dawn so they could sneak back into the camp. He wanted to tell her something but couldn’t remember what. The 6 AM horn sounded and he filed into the shower room. As the water hit him, he remembered bits of the dream he’d had the night before. Mars Girl had been on the subway, only she had green and purple hair. There were fish floating through the air, but no water. He couldn’t quite piece it together.
He ate breakfast like it was cough syrup.
“Hey, I thought you’d be hungry this morning,” Lina said, giving him a little elbow. “You’re making me feel like I messed up somehow last night.”
“Not to worry,” he said. “I guess I didn’t sleep much — crazy dreams. I’m sure by tonight, I’ll be hungry again.” He nudged her back.
“Glad to hear it. Weird to have to sneak around though, hah? Our Tiny might have just been one big room, but we could take care of all our earthly needs just fine.”
“If only it was waterproof and had a boat engine.”
After breakfast, they shaped up with their crew and made the usual march down to the work site. Another morning moving scattered bricks and twisted steel. But the streets looked almost normal. 
Maybe the worst of it was over, Raefe thought. Lina is right, I can’t drown in this. 
He let himself feel the arms and legs of the dozen of them, pushing, lifting, shaping, building. It was an infectious rhythm, an old-timey Second Line street parade of sweat and exertion, and he gave himself over to it.  Soon he was lost in all their thoughts, feeling the silver fish of their thoughts pass through his gold…
Holy shit. This is what I dreamed. Purple and green lady was not Mars Girl, she was Aleron, an alien. Did that actually happen?
Maybe it had been a dream, but the feeling wouldn’t go away. He couldn’t actually read anyone’s thoughts, like what did Mo, the big Haitian guy, think about Sonja as he was chatting her up, but he felt that Mo was not paying attention to his shovel, and thinking he was somewhere else, a food stand maybe? Lina had a bit of a hum about her. Everyone was enjoying the sun as it warmed up this fallish October morning. Wasn’t that what Aleron had said, that he’d be connected?
No voices were talking to him from the clouds. He wasn’t getting instructions to kill everyone with blue eyes or shorter than a meter and a half. And he wasn’t getting a headache. Real or not, maybe something had happened to him during the night. Something good, for a change.
“Hey, dreamy,” Nhitin, their crew boss, barked. “Sleep at night, work during the day. You’re starting to get the hang of it — show me you can totally do it.”
“The staff’s all wound up,” Sammy, one of the guys on their crew, whispered to him. “Something’s going down.”
All morning, people traded rumors — they were all being shipped out somewhere, the government was going to build new TinyStacks for everyone, they were all getting $10,000 to start anew. Anyone who had salvaged their Voice or taken their ‘puter when fleeing the water was sneaking off to search for answers. But no one found any clear answers. There were dozens of camps like this, the government itself was even less functional than usual, and the Net was full of even more sooty information than usual. Morning went and at noon they had lunch break. A Brightstar Defense Services truck showed up with food. Raefe and Lina grabbed some rice and beans and found a good rubble pile to sit on.
“Hey, Nhitin thinks you’re dreamy,” Lina teased him.
“Any dream with Nhitin in it counts as a nightmare to me,” Raefe shot back.
“But you had those dreams again last night, didn’t you?” she asked. “It worries me.”
“I had a dream, kind of strange, but no, it wasn’t what you think. I’m fine.”
“Well, good. Wouldn’t be good if you freak out every time we get busy.”
“Authentic. I think more tests are called for, Dr. Feelgood.” 
“I think they should test this food,” Lina grimaced. “Tastes like it was made before the flood.”
Something loud was coming from back over Winter Hill. The lunch chatter stopped as everyone looked up. Three large helicopters approached rapidly, noise and dust growing.
“More Brightstar,” Lina shouted over the noise.
“Yeah, I see,” Raefe said. “Same blue camo as the truck.”
 As fast as they had appeared, they landed down the block, on a now empty used electric car lot. Some government soldiers got out, followed by some suits and a woman in a Brightstar officer’s uniform. The soldiers escorted the suits and the Brightstar brass toward the worksite.
“Geez,” he whispered to Lina, “They look like they’re on a mission behind the lines.”
“I’m Captain Erzel, Second Engineers, Brightstar Logistics,” the woman said through a bullhorn. “We want to tell you what’s next in the relief effort.  We’ve been asked by the government to coordinate now that we’re past the initial crisis. With me is Ken Robertson, the CEO of Digi Brands. He’s going to explain what’s next.”
“Thanks, Captain Erzel,” Robertson said, taking the bullhorn. “You’re probably wondering why this surprise visit in the middle of the day. The simple reason is that we’re all in a hurry, you and me and 100 million people on the East Coast whose lives were torn up by Hurricane Fatima almost a month ago. Roads are still spotty, the Net goes in and out, and people want to get home and back to school and work. Take a look around.”
Robertson swept his arm across the scenery.
“You’ve worked hard. There are 13 other relief camps along the Massachusetts Bay, and they have all done the same. You’ve paved the way, so to speak, for the next phase. Rebuilding. And so we need to bring in real builders. When it comes to putting up bridges, roadways, housing and offices fast and efficiently, Brightstar Logistics is second to none. So they are going to take over that phase of it. But we have some priorities that need your contribution, urgently, and we’re going to be moving you, and many of the other relief camps to those places and projects.”
“Excuse me,” a middle-aged man stood up. “Moving us? What happened to rebuilding our homes, our neighborhoods? And why are you, Digi Brands, talking to us? Where’s the mayor? The governor?”
Robertson looked uncomfortable. An aide whispered in his ear.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “My associate was just explaining to me that you may not be aware of the latest news. Things have been moving fast. So let me backtrack a little. Some of you still have your puters and you may be aware that the crisis has stretched the government, at all levels, to a breaking point. Put simply, the government is broke, bankrupt. President Epstein and I have been discussing the situation for the last two weeks and we have come to an agreement. The US government has granted Digi Brands a semi-autonomous zone that corresponds to the entire Massachusetts Bay flood area. We are assuming responsibility for rebuilding, because we see tremendous opportunity here, and we have the resources to stay in it for the duration.”
“So what are you saying?” the man who had interrupted asked. “We work for you?”
“Precisely,” Robertson smiled. “And we have important work to do. We, along with Brightstar, have prioritized rebuilding the Atlantic Sea Wall as a top priority. We expect two or three more hurricanes between now and February that are Category 5 or worse. You’ll be working with the Brightstar team on Truro Island. These helicopters will take you there — don’t worry, your personal belongings from the camp are being packed up right now and will be on board shortly.”
“Finish your food,” Captain Erzel said. “In 20 minutes, we’ll load up the choppers and head out.”

            <Synopsis>Lina entangles with Fatima</Synopsis>
            <Text>Meeting of the Minds
May 21, 2049
Living in Dadaab felt nothing like Cambridge to Raefe. In Cambridge, he was surrounded by a dense fog from which he could sense just the dimmest light of people’s thoughts and feelings. Here fog was a thin mist and the dim light was replaced by soft whispers, each person distinct and sometimes comprehensible.
“I feel like it wouldn’t take much to connect with most of these people,” Raefe said.
“Some of them, like Edna, are so close to being able to entangle,” Lina replied. “They finish each other’s sentences so often it’s more like someone started the other person’s thought.”
“I asked Aleron if she could nudge them over the line,” he said, “but she won’t. She says they made an exception with you and then by connecting us, but we must find our own way. Otherwise, it could turn out badly. But I don’t know how to do that.”
And then he felt hungry, yet happy that it was a cool day. But they weren’t his feelings.
“What was that?” he asked.
“That was Edna’s daughter, Fatima.”
“You can feel her mind that way?”
“Yes, I have been around her for many weeks and know her mind well. But we have grown closer, too. I wanted to see if I could do that, connect your mind to hers through mine. And it worked?”
“That wasn’t just me feeling your idea of her? That was her?”
“Yes, she is a very intuitive person, like her mother. So it was easier with her.”
“But she can’t feel your thoughts?”
“Not yet,” she smiled. “But I have an idea.”
Later, she bumped into Edna.
“You will come to my daughter’s ceremony this afternoon, after Friday prayers?” Edna asked.
“I won’t be at prayers, but yes, for Fatima I will be there,” Lina replied.
“This is your first time, for such a ceremony?”
“Yes. Is there anything I need to know?”
“No, just look for the hut with the red banners near the dining hall at the far end of the camp. Everything will  explain itself. Here, we have so many different traditions we do not worry too much about doing things just so. It is enough to do them at all. I will be with the mothers, and we will sing. Fatima will drink a special tea we will make her, so that she can hear the truth of what we sing. And then we will dress her and she will return to her family and friends a woman.”
And able to entangle, thought Lina. She felt Raefe in her mind, excited by her plan.
“You realize how big this is,” he said. “To see if we can create a whole new kind of human relationship?”
“I’m trying just to think about it like a new kind puter message,” she said. “One that doesn’t need a puter.”
When the time came, Lina had trouble calming herself. Making small talk with the other women was excruciating.Then the ceremonial tea was served, and Lina found herself slowly being more drawn into the group.
She  had thought through carefully what was about to happen. She would concentrate on Fatima, reaching out, gently touching her mind. Raefe would be in the nearby dining hall, pretending to read a book but actually monitoring what he could of the other women. Since Truro Island, they’d not been able to move their new world off of the same path as their old one. Now, maybe, they could take a first step in creating the kind of world the Guardians seemed to live in.
Edna and a few of her long-time friends began the ceremony. Edna spoke in Swahili, but some of the songs she and the other women sang were in other languages she didn’t understand. Some also sounded like Arabic prayers. Finally, Fatima was brought into the middle of the tent, all the other women around her in a circle. She wore her normal clothes, except for a new red headscarf.
Edna said more words in a language Lina didn’t know. Then Fatima began to sing those words and more in the same language. The song was long, and Fatima fell into its rhythms, her voice now speaking from somewhere inside her.
Lina found Fatima’s mind easily. Lina heard the thoughts in the song, of creation, of every woman’s part in the creation of the world, and of the worlds to come. Lina could feel Fatima’s joy. When Fatima was done, she sat quietly, a huge grin on her face. Another woman began a song, this one a bit racey, about a woman and a man. Certain lines brought laughter from some of the women. No need to translate, Lina thought.
Lina calmed herself and focused on Fatima’s mind. “I am happy for you,” she thought, repeating the thought as in a chant. After a minute or so, she felt Fatima register her presence in her thoughts. The girl was a bit alarmed.
“Why does it seem like Lina is in my mind,” Fatima asked herself.
“Because we are in each other’s minds,” Lina answered.
“Oh, my mother never said anything about this. Is this part of being a woman? Sometimes it feels like the aunties are in each other’s minds,” Fatima thought.
“No, this is just you and me,” Lina said. “We have made a strong connection since I came. I could feel your thoughts easily.”
“Can you read other people’s minds?” Fatima thought. “Can they read yours?”
“Yes, I can read a few other people’s minds, and they mine. I believe we can all do this eventually. You seemed open to it, so I thought I’d try. I think the tea helped.”
“What if I don’t want to share my thoughts with you?” Fatima asked.
“Can you feel this part of your mind?” Lina asked, touching a certain part of her thoughts lightly.
“Yes.”
“Focus on that and make that the center of your thoughts.” She felt Fatima’s thoughts gradually fade way. She made eye contact with her and made a “OK?” face. She felt Fatima come back to her mind.
“We will talk more later, Fatima,” Lina said. “For now, I just wanted to say congratulations.” She felt Fatima’s “thanks.”
The ceremony went on some, but Lina felt drained. She stayed long enough to eat some of the little cakes on offer, and then wandered out of the tent. She felt Raefe reaching out to her.
“I think that went OK,” Lina said.
“You were able to entangle with her?” Raefe said.
“Yes, and she with me. I showed her how to block her thoughts, too. And then she initiated contact again. But it was exhausting.”
“For my part, I could feel other minds sort of paying attention, but no more. I think they felt a disturbance, like a  breeze, but nothing too upsetting.”
“Good.”
She walked to the edge of the camp, wanting to be alone and regroup. She sat on the ground, a tree between her back and the camp. Some large birds were perched on a tree in the distance, their occasional squawks managing to sound both languid and menacing. She could see they were taking turns feeding on a dead animal below them. The warm breezes felt good and soon she felt herself slipping into a dreamless sleep. She awoke suddenly, as if her mind had sensed danger. It was almost dark now and the light was falling like a soft dark curtain. She realized someone was standing in front of her. Lina made herself very still and quiet.
“Who are you?” the stranger asked. It was Edna’s voice.
“What do you mean? You know who I am.”
“Millima Kawambai-Yang, now Lina. But who are you really? Are you a witch?”
“Why would you say that?”
“In the tent, you touched my daughter’s mind.”
“She told you this?”
“No, she knows nothing of this. I felt it.”
“You can feel other people’s minds?” Lina asked.
“Yes, a little. Not like a witch, but a little.”
“I’m not a witch. I’m just Lina. I can feel other people’s thoughts, and sometimes they can feel mine. I think all of you can almost do it. Your troubles have brought you together. And your ideas have made you open to each other.”
“Why did you touch Fatima’s mind?”
“I feel her thoughts all of the time — she is like a radio broadcasting. I wanted her to feel mine. To talk and feel each other’s thoughts better.”
“Can you feel mine?”
“Yes, sometimes.”
“And doing what you do — it’s not dangerous to her? Or to you?”
“No, it’s not that different than when you feel a deep connection with someone. Only now, it’s in words and it’s alive — you’re trading your thoughts and feelings as if talking. But clearer, because the right words are not always easy to find.”
“Teach me to do this.”
“Why?”
“Because if we could all do this, we could heal our wounds and be stronger. We could learn trust. And who not to trust.”
“I’m so glad you said that, because that was my purpose. I have never done this before. Fatima was just the person who it seemed easiest with. I wanted to wait and see what happened. I can’t teach everyone, and certainly not at once. Will you trust me to wait?”
“She is my daughter. I want to protect her if she needs it. If you teach me now, I won’t say anything until you want me to.”
“I will need help — our connection is not yet strong. I might need Raefe to help.”
“He can do this, too?”
“Yes, he showed me how. He is very strong this way. Will you come to our tent around 10? We can see what we can do.”
“I will come with Fatima. I don’t want her to feel alone in this.”
“OK. Edna — I want you to know I would never hurt Fatima. Everything we do, Raefe and I, we have been hurt, too. We want to find a new way to heal. We want to prevent all of this, and worse, from happening to the whole world.” She point with her head toward the camp.
“If you are telling the truth, I will help you. But for now, you should be careful who you say what to. Some people will be afraid of you.”

            <Title>The kids compare notes</Title>
            <Text>Mik was almost feeling relieved. At least AI interfacer was something he wouldn’t hate. That much. He was dying to find out what his friends got. Everyone would be at The Dive, their name for Hot Joes,  coffee bar that mostly catered to low-level office clerks from the New Kendall offices. That was the beauty of The Dive — they wouldn’t have to see any of the other kids from school. And the regulars there couldn’t care less what they were talking about.
Junior and Seanito had already grabbed the big table in the back corner. They looked neither crushed nor celebratory.
“Hey,” Mik said. “How’d it go?”
“Grand,” Junior said. “I’m going to be Ken Robertson’s new assistant. Job comes with a penthouse apartment.”
“And it all works out,” Seanito said, “’cause I’m going to be the bodyguard/chauffeur. That way I get to use the limo on my own time. Girls love that.”
“So Junior, you got logistics, and Seanito, you got maintenance, right?” Mik said.
“Wiseguy. Yes, I did get logistics, but also marketing and product development,” Junior said.
“And no, I didn’t get maintenance,” Seanito said. “New Kendall is very committed to new opportunities for people from non-European backgrounds, didn’t you know that?”
They all laughed.
“Seriously, I got Def, so my dad will be happy,” Seanito said. “But I also got demographic analyst and infrastructure planner.”
“Wow, we have infrastructure planners?” Mik said. “Who knew?”
“Well, that’s the most interesting one to me,” Seanito said. “Maybe I could actually do some good. New roads, housing, that sort of thing.”
“Somebody has to figure out how to make underwater sleeping bags,” Junior said. 
“Verdad,” Seanito said. “But enough about me. What’s your gig, Mik?”
“Well, I got marketing and logistics, too, like Junior. No offense, not interested.”
“No worries, me neither,” Junior said. “What was your third?”
“That was the good news — AI interfacer,” Mik said.
“Really? You want to talk to puters all day?” Seanito asked.
“More than I want to talk to corpos, I’m pretty sure,” Mik said. “So I’m not too bummed out. Was your interview weird?”
“You mean, are we in New Kendall?” Junior asked. “But specifically, what was weird?”
Mik saw Nila out of the corner of his eye, headed there way.
“Hey,” she said, slumping down into the chair. She waved toward the server, who came over, having nothing else to do.
“Can I get a beer?” she asked.
“No,” he said. “Not until after 4. You know the rules. ‘Clear minds make clear choices at work and school.’”
“Well, everything’s too clear already,” Nila said. “But I don’t want you to get in trouble., You guys all want coffee?”
They nodded.
“Four white coffees then,” Nila said. The server went away. 
“So?” Mik asked.
“So, I’m fucked,” Nila said. “Sec, monetization or surveillance.”
“Wow, you won the lottery,” Seanito said.
“Yeah, why are you so bummed,” Junior said. “My parents would die for me to have that.”
“We’re all lifers here,” Nila said. “But we all don’t have to give a shit. Like all these guys sitting around us. They go to work, they go home, they get their three squares and their dry feet. They kiss their partner, fuck enough to get their one kid, and then keep the kid out of too much trouble. No one cares what they think, they don’t have to make a big show of how grateful they are. All of that — I’d rather have all of that.”
“Yeah, I’m with you on that,” Mik said. “That’s why I’m not too bummed about AI interfacer — I can do that without having to be all gung ho and rah rah.”
“A little enthusiasm never killed anyone,” Seanito said.
“Well, there were those fugees that tried to cross the river,” Mik said.
“Verdad,” Junior said. “But they were desperate. I just want to have two feet out of the water. If I have to show a little enthusiasm to have dry feet, I might make that move. Seems dumb not to.”
Junior seemed annoyed. Mik wondered if Nila was about to snap his head off, but she softened.
“Yeah, I get that. I know I have it lucky, my mom’s a corpo and all,” Nila said. “But a little enthusiasm is worse than none with those guys. You have to be all in with them. They test you all the time.”
“I got a taste of that,” Mik said. “Cragen, the guy who interviewed me, he kept wanting to know what I want to do in five or ten years. How the hell would I know? I didn’t know what to say and it felt like there was definitely a wrong answer, even if I didn’t know what it was.”
“So what did you say?” Nila asked.
“Nothing. I got him to talk instead. He answered the question for me and I just nodded and said, yeah, that sounds interesting.”
“Smart,” Nila said.
“Well, I guess we all have some hard choices to make,” Junior said. “Like are we going to put sugar in our coffee?” 
The server put four mugs down. They drank and talked about the new stream from Smiling Cloud, the band they all liked. In the new stream, there was one very quick scene where they band was dressed in short green pants and orange tunics. Nila thought they were giving a nod to some rebel group in the UK. Junior thought it was the colors of their favorite footie team. Neither Mik nor Seanito had noticed. 
“Hey, Nila, I didn’t mean to come down so hard on you,” Junior said. “I guess I was pissed because you burst my bnbble a little. Truth is, I don’t know why I should give a shit. It’s not like New Kendall is going to make the world better. If I ever have a kid, they’ll probably have it even worse. And their kids. Just sometimes, I have to pretend it matters.”
“Yeah, I hear you,” Nila said. “I’m not saying your a fool to feel that way. Who doesn’t want to hope for the best? I just feel they’re using that to make fools of us. It pisses me off. But I know we all have to do what we all have to do.” 
They had finished their coffee by the time they decided no one had any idea what it meant. They paid their bill and started to leave. Nila turned away from Junior and Seanito toward Mik.
“Walk with me?” Nila asked Mik.
“Sure,” Mik said. “Hey guys, see you later, OK? And glad you guys got something you liked.”
“Yeah, you too,” Junior said. And he Seanito headed down toward the gym.
“Wow, I thought you and Junior were going to duke it out there for a minute,” Mik said when they were out of earshot.
“Yeah for a minute I thought so too,” Nila. “But he’s alright. Look, I know I’m a spoiled corpo brat. What can I do about it?”
“Nothing,” Mik agreed. “But I was glad you didn’t snap back at him. And I think he appreciated it, too. There’s no sense in us all falling on each other because of New Kendall.”
Nila nodded. “I’m too depressed to fight with my friends, anyway. I’m so fucked.”
“Yeah, I heard you say that. Because you got Sec?”
“Yeah, but not just that. Don’t you see what’s going on?”
“Not sure I know what you mean,” Mik said.
“My mom’s wired me up. Sec, monetization, surveillance. Junior and Seanito are not wrong — those are the golden tickets around here. To a lifetime in the upper echelons of New Kendall. They’ve sent me a message — you’re one of the elite.”
“Huh, hadn’t thought of it that way. And you don’t want to be, I get that.”
“And it’s worse. My mom hit me on my Voice right after the meeting. She’s so proud, nyak, nyak. She’s practically packed my bags for Security boot camp.”
“What if you picked monetization or surveillance? Would that be better?”
“No, I’d just have to push harder to make an impression. My mom’s pull with them isn’t so strong. Although I’m starting to wonder if maybe Kenny boy wasn’t in on this, too.”
Mik was startled. Why would Robertson care about her? This was when she annoyed him, with her penchant for dramatics.
“What if you didn’t make an impression? What if you did demand surveillance and just put in your time and didn’t crush it?”
“You can’t half step it in those jobs. They’d give me a couple of stern talkings and then ship me off to wash dishes in a mining camp. It happened to someone my mom worked with — they make examples out of people who are ‘let into the tent and then just piss in the corner.’ That’s how they see it.”
“So what are you going to do?”
“Sneak a few of my mom’s chewies and sleep for a week.”
“Sounds like plan,” he laughed.
“But what about you? That interview sounded creepy.”
“It was. I’ve never met that guy before. Ferd Cragen.”
“Oh, no! He’s a super creep. Remember little Annie Nova?”
“Yeah, I do. Very nervous, anxious all the time. Whatever happened to her?”
“Cragen used to be a head doc. He treated her. No idea for what, all hush hush. But she opened up to me — I guess I didn’t know I was an empath back then. She told him she was having all these problems. You now what he told her? It was all her fault, she was ungrateful, needed to look deep into her soul and straighten out and fly right, all that bullshit. I didn’t know what to say, but it sure sounded like bullshit. A week later, she topped herself.”
“No! I knew there was something off about him.”
“Yeah, don’t listen to a word he says.”
“I didn’t. But I’m not feeling as trapped as you. This AI interfacer, I actually like doing that. And I can half-step it, as you say, all the way to the end. Nobody really cares.”
“Maybe, maybe not,” she said. “Shit happens around here, and nobody asks you your opinion. But doesn’t it feel sad? Our whole life in front of us, and we’re trying to find a way to do the least we can?”
“And survive,” he said. “Let’s not forget that part. Not everyone can say that.”
“Verdad,” she said. “And I just don’t know if I can stand being part of making that worse.”
“Yeah, it’s a bitch. Dammed either way. What are we going to do?”
“Besides get wasted? I don’t know. Well, at least you can kiss me.”
And he did. For a few seconds, neither of them cared about the future. And then she ran up the path to her building and disappeared.

            <Notes>Somehow, Guardians find out what’s going on. Diver and Flyer argue about whether they should intervene. Flyer realizes that New K could never have figured this out on their own. It must have come from Hanikori. That changes everything.

The Guardians investigate. Hanikori admits he interfered and gave them tech. It’s just taken them this long to understand how to work it.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Guardian rebels revealed.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 9

Hanakori has picked the location with great care. On the slopes of Anonto’s only active volcano, there is an ancient lava tube. Deep at the bottom, there is boiling lava that sends hot air out of a vent at the top. But there is also small chute that leads to it, whose entrance is hidden by rocks that block its view, but still leave room to enter. The shape of the tube prevents too much heat from entering it. But the entire area is filled with masses of swirling ions generated by the lava below. There is so much quantum activity that most Guardians could never penetrate the static to entangle with him, let alone an ordinary A’Moptan. 
Hanakori, on the other hand, has made a study of quantum noise and has perfected his own filtering techniques. So the cave is safe from prying minds. Still, he trusts no one.
“Anatope, prepare a quantum key for this meeting. No one must know what we are discussing.”
All 17 of them absorb the four-dimensional construct that will allow them to converse in isolation, their waveform impossible to comingle with any other without their knowledge.
“This meeting couldn’t come at a more crucial time,” Hanakori said. “The most naïve of the Guardian ambassadors, Aleron, has crossed the line and is now revealing herself to the barbarians called the People. These are nothing more than killers, and yet she has blinded herself to their natures.”
“What of it, Hanakori?” Putnomo interrupted. “Let her waste her time while they destroy themselves.”
“You are many light years from them,” Hanakori answered. “We are only six. She may already be breaking her oath and leaking technical information to them. I believe her objectivity may be compromised.  If she persists, in a millennia or two, they may well develop the means to threaten not only us, but other nearby species.”
“Hanakori, you are a politician and you excel at the ancient tradition of frightening the populace. I am a scientist,” Natonkku said. “The People could not become a threat to us in ten millennia, even if they survive.”
“Are you willing to bet the future of all life on that, Natonkku?” Anatope interrupted with disgust. “Perhaps you won’t feel so complacent when you learn that Salmerikon nurtures their child. His weak vision will be further clouded by their coupling. When he tells you that the Guardian Council says you must make do with less energy for your lightspeed engine development because it is needed to continue shifting People to timelines where they haven’t blown themselves up, you will surely reconsider.””
 “Enough,” Hanakori thundered, the waveform vibrating with his intensity. “Let us not forget our purpose today.”
“Thank you,” Putnomo said. “Whatever our differing opinions about Aleron, we can all agree that the most important thing is to press ahead with our work on e12.””
Only they know that e12 is the latest iteration in their top-secret research they have been carrying out for more than a thousand years. 
 “I have excellent news to report,” Putnomo said. “About 1,100 years ago, we Guarded a very unusual species on the outer edges of the Eta Carinae nebula. It was the only life, let alone intelligent life, that we have ever found that was composed of only organized gas and plasma. We learned very little about it before Eta Carinae erupted in a small nova that destroyed the region. For those of you who are new to our efforts, it was this encounter that started Hanakori and myself and a few others to realize that with some effort, this kind of life could be immortal.
 “Three things had to be solved to make that happen. The first – reducing an individual’s consciousness to free-standing waves –– is already something all of our species could do, if we had not bound ourselves foolishly to retain our ancient forms. The second was how to overcome entropy – how can a waveform, in essence, eat while still retaining its essential nature? The third was how to continue to manipulate matter while remaining pure energy.””
Hanakori could hardly contain his impatience. Putnomo was always so impressed with himself. “So what have you learned recently?”
He let them see his laboratory, hidden by a cloud of comets. Inside, a force field in which only a large plasma cloud existed, suspended by intense magnetic fields. They watched as Putnomo donned a helmet on his homeworld, nearly a billion miles away. For a few seconds nothing happened and then Putnomo allowed them to entangle with the plasma cloud itself, through him. And then he broke his connection with them.
The waveform shuddered as they all gasped. The plasma cloud retained much of Putnomo’s consciousness. In fact, it shifted gradually as the entangled with it.
Putnomo reconnected with them. “Yes, I was able to project my consciousness into the cloud, and while it couldn’t think entirely new thoughts, it did react to you in small ways. For the first time, we have created consciousness in a cloud of plasma.””
The waveform pulsed with approval and delight. Even Hanakori was impressed.
“Are there fundamental issues you still need to address?” he wondered.
“Not fundamental ones, no. We have maybe a decade or two of engineering before we can attempt a full transfer, and then perhaps some more time to ensure stability. But there is every reason to believe that we have found a way to preserve consciousness for all time. In short, to be immortal.”
“And what about the third obstacle,” Natonkku queried. “Does any of this bode well for addressing that?”
“We have been working in parallel on that. We chose the confined plasma precisely because we have known for millennia how to control it. It was one of the main technologies of the controlled fusion era. Reversing that, having the plasma control ordinary matter, is challenging but conceptually well understood.” Putnomo was in all his glory now. “I feel strongly that we are perhaps 100 years away from a demonstration combining conscious energy and material control.”
Hankori steered them back to the immediate threat. “All the more reason to not waste time or resources on foolishness.”
“What is your proposal?” asked Natonkku.
Hankori hesitated. He wasn’t interested in fully revealing his plans. “For now, we should all exercise vigilance over this ridiculous project with the People. And we must lay the groundwork for us to turn the Guardians from the naïve fostering of any kind of conscious life to the further development of our species, who are the highest form of consciousness.”
“What is at stake,” he continued, “is nothing less than the evolution of conscious life itself. In a million millennia, only 20 species have in the entire galaxy have reached the stage of enhanced life. Should we spend another billion years hoping to find a few more? And leave ourselves vulnerable to forces beyond our control? To the whims of supernovas? To attack from far corners of the galaxy, or from beings in other galaxies who have gone beyond us in lightspeed travel or solved the riddle of faster than light travel?”
“We have earned immortality, and we deserve it. Let us turn the Guardians from this foolish philosophy of naïve benevolence to one of true Guardianship – of our species, and our future.”
Natonkku pulsed back “how seriously should we take Aleron’s report about this entangler Raefe? And is there concern that should these People make real progress it might get in the way of our work?”
The meeting is over, and Hanakori feels minds drop away. But Anatope, Levilon, Trakkum, and Dolintin know to linger.
“The others think only of the promise, and not the threat,” Leviton said. “I sympathize with your impatience, Hanakori. But the situation is even more dire than you know.””
He transmits a snippet has recorded from Aleron’s quarters.
“You know that Anatope and Hanakori have been increasingly vocal about your missions. Not just yours, either.&quot; 
&quot;I'm not sure it's a relief to know it's not just me.&quot;  
&quot;No, it's not. Increasingly, I suspect that they have doubts about our Guardian role. But I am concerned that they don't share their true doubts, nor the fullness of their thoughts.&quot; 
 “We need to manage the final stage very carefully,” Hanakori said. “Anatope, I want you to monitor the wormhole interface network and Earth’s information matrix constantly. The rest of you, we need to take steps to divert Aleron and cast doubt on Salmerikon. We are not ready for the final phase, but the next few decades will lay the groundwork.”</Text>

            <Text>Preface
A billion years ago
A group of fighters stand on a battlefield, bone weary, dirty, hunger their only nourishment. They can only see a few stars in the night sky through the smoke of battle. The roar of battle is over for now, the world quiet as the remaining armies of all three Houses pause in the carnage that has consumed their world.
 In a clearing, one of the fighters stands on hood of a personnel carrier. Naw’ra, a low-ranking officer in the army of the Second House, addresses a a few dozen officers from all three armies.
“Brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, we have fought this great battle for many years. One in three of us who was alive when it started has now fallen. Our air is thick with smoke, our water with blood, and our land covered with our dead, and the dead of all else that once lived here, and with poisons that will kill for years. We have fought each other for land, for wealth, for power, and we have exhausted all three in doing so.
“The three great Houses of U Maw have defeated each other and themselves in the process. I tell you that the soldiers of the Second House will fight no more. I ask the First House and the Third House to put your weapons down. They will help you no more.’
“How nice for you if we do,” shouts someone from the Third House. “I guess you want us to give you our food and children, too.””
“I want no such thing,” Naw’Ra answers, and pauses, slowing her breathing down, remembering that she has come to persuade, not to fight. “I want you to remember that before there were three Houses, there were the clans, and before the clans, there were the bands, and before that, there were just the Maw’u’I, talking animals who could not only imagine the future, but build their dreams. And in only 150,000 years, they settled all the lands and lived mostly in peace, however simple their life seems to us now. We are those same creatures, but we have lost our way. We let ourselves believe that peace and cooperation was stagnation and that only war and competition brought progress.”
“What do you want us to do?” shouts a solider from the Second House. “Tear off our clothes and live like savages?”
“Our answer is to move forward. I ask your patience for a minute, and you will begin to understand. I need only your stillness and quiet.” Naw’Ra nods, and one soldier in each of the other houses nods in return. Her two coconspirators join their minds with her and they reach out to entangle with the group around them. Despite all their doubts, they succeed. 
The soldiers gasp, feeling the connection. Now Naw’Ri speaks to them directly in their minds, her thoughts and feelings mingle with theirs. After   drowning in the fear and boredom of battle, there is something about touching the core of so many others that is deeply restorative.
“I know your heart and now you know mine. This is the first step to peace, and peace is the first step toward progress. But we need more — we need a home whose air and water doesn’t bring disease, whose land can support food. Someday, this planet will be that again, but for now, it cannot.  For years, a small group from all three houses has been working secretly on a project that will give us a new start. And now we will show you.”
All of them are still now, their minds filled with a strangely different sky, a subtley different landscape. They see a pristine world for the first time. The air tickles their nostrils, fresher than anything they have ever breathed. This new world beckons.
Soliders fall to the ground, sobbing at the joy of discovery. They look through the eyes of a few dozen souls on this new world, the first ever to leave their world. The settlers are from all three Houses. 
“Who are you?” one soldier shouts at the sky. They all feel the response.
“We are your fellow citizens, waiting for you to join us as Explorers, and as builders,” says A’mon, from the new world. “Look at the red planet just above your eastern horizon. We are there, yet we can know your thoughts and feelings, too, and you can know ours, as if we were in the same room.”
“Go home to your armies and your leaders,” Naw’Ra says. “Tell them that a new era has begun. For those who want it, I will train you to entangle so that you can demonstrate to others that this is the future we can all be part of. I have laid down my arms, and so have many others in the three armies. From this day, we are Guardians of this world. We have been fortunate to have ripped open the fabric of reality and to have seen more deeply into it than anyone before us. I have seen that there is so much power for us there that there is no need to fight over it. And now we will use that knowledge to better understand ourselves and our world.”

            <Text>A promising planet
September 8, 2048
Salmerikon was in a hurry to prepare for his session with the new class of cadets. Even after hundreds of years of welcoming them, he still got just a little nervous about starting them off on the right foot. He tried not to interrupt her work too much — he knew certain people were ready to make a scandal of their budding relationship. But it wouldn’t hurt to see how Aleron was doing with her projects. He always got a kick out of her enthusiasm.
How odd, he thought as he saw her sitting still in the inner ring around the pulsing energy of the wormhole interface. He touched her mind lightly, politely, so as not to startle her.
“Aren’t you the diligent one,” he let her know. “Coming right to the source.”
“You give me too much credit,” she said, speaking out loud. “You may recall that you assigned me to monitor Earth.”
“Yes, I do remember. The civilization doggedly stuck in Optimization, yet showing a small but definite promise that it may progress to Balance, where it would likely flourish.”
“Precisely. Until now, though, I have barely been able to sense them unless I am here, receiving the pure signal. Just now, my most promising entangler, a young human named Raefe, was almost killed, in a flood. Many were. I fear for him — their civilization is trapped in the classic downward spiral of crisis. Those with the power to change things delude themselves and use their power to protect their own narrow interests.”
“Our work is hard. We have failed with many species, and they’ve perished. Even when we succeed with a species, we always have to consider that at some later date they may revert and become a serious threat outside their own star systems.  But I sense that what troubles you most is the fate this Raefe.”
“He has a hard life. He experiences his own gift as an affliction, and he sees himself as weak and useless. But now something interesting has happened. The shock of near death allowed his mind to open up. And now he feels himself being flooded by connections. This will either elevate him or drive him mad.” 
“Keep me informed. Next week is the Guardian Council meeting. At the very least, let’s talk about it there. Now I have to go.”

            <Text>Raefe could hear Ines talking with Tosh downstairs. He wanted to learn more about how she had mimicked his signature and fooled the New K attackers and went down to take the opportunity.
“Hey, nice to see you,” he said.
“You, too,” she said.
“Ines was just telling me that she’s let Mik know that Nila is OK,” Tosh said.
“No need to tangle him to know he’s got a thing for her,” Ines said. “He was hoping she’d settle over this side so he could see her. Now he wants to help somehow. Told him I’d pass that on.”
“Thanks,” Raefe said. “She, we, are still figuring out what’s safe for her. And us. Her mom’s bad news and it gets worse from there. We’ll have to think on Mik. But, hey, wanted to thank you again for all your help. And to understand what you did. It felt like you can imitate my signature.”
“Verdad,” Ines said. “Didn’t know that was a new thing. To me, it’s just like hearing someone saying something and then imitating it.”
“You can do that with anyone?” he asked.
“Not sure. Don’t try it too often. It’s just a little game I played with myself when I had just discovered tangling. Wasn’t too many people I could practice with, but I used to play this game of listening for someone’s mind and then imitating what it felt like.”
“But it wasn’t just you,” Tosh said. “I could feel many more.”
“Yeah, makes sense,” Ines said. “Everywhere, you have your own idea of what tangling is and what it’s for. The rest of us fugees, we do what we do. Like, you don’t put thoughts in people’s heads. For sure, when I sneak into New K and I see a Sec, I put in his head to look away from me.”
Raefe felt uneasy. “You’re right, we do have rules. Well, not rules. We think of it as morals. Just because we can mess with someone’s mind, doesn’t mean we should. Would be like someone really strong thinking it’s alright to threaten people.”
“Sure, sure,” Ines said. “But you’d send that brother into a fight against the Secs, wouldn’t you?”
“Fair enough,” Raefe said. “What else do you all do that we don’t?”
“I don’t know,” she said, slightly annoyed. “We just don’t see it as all or nothing as you. A friend might come into my mind at certain times, you know, that feel good, too. Not just for mayhem!”
“Yeah, we do that, too,” Tosh said. “You must think we’re all boring monks or something. But living with each other all the time, we also like to have some boundaries.”
“With you there,” she said. “But didn’t you feel it, it wasn’t just that we had Raefe’s signature. We were all clocked, man, we were all like a band playing the same tune. I saw this old vid once when they used to have these giant football matches and 80,000 people were cheering and singing for their team. It was almost like that.”
“Yeah, I felt that,” Raefe said. “We had those moments in Everywhere — once we had 10,000 people singing together. But they were singing — not locked together in one mind. We never tried. Fifty years ago, there were still big governments, and some of them wanted everyone to have one mind. Not with empathy — just lockstep.”
“Yeah, my dad told me about that,” Tosh said. “They used to call it brainwashing. Getting everyone not just feeling the same way, but believing some lie, couldn’t talk them out of it.”
“And I wonder if the Secs want to try that again,” Raefe said.
“You worry too much,” Ines said. “Secs do what they do. What you do back? That’s what matters now. You know the waters come closer to our feet every day, no? Maybe you find some hill to preach truth from, who’s in the valley listening? Too busy keeping their noses above the water. You have to be alive to do good. First things first.”
Raefe sighed. “And when the Secs find out you can do this, and they figure out how to do it themselves, what then?”
“I’ll think on that,” she said. “But you think on it, too. You know way more about this than I do. Maybe there’s a way. Because when we were all together, we had something there. We don’t need to agree on everything. You’re the one always telling me we need to work together, fight together. I thought you’d be up on this.”
Raefe smiled. “I can see I need to get up on this. And think on it, like you say.”
“Think on this, too,” Ines said. “Everywhere, you have your way of tangling. Me, someother fugees, who know who else, we have our way. Not just our way, our reasons for doing it. And then you have all the others. Like Mik. He’s easy to tangle with, but he can’t do it. How you put all that together? ‘Cause, you have to admit, if the plan was get everyone to be like Everywhere, you had your chance.”
“Maybe it just takes a long time,” Tosh said, a little too sharply.
“No, she’s right,” Raefe said. “I’ve been wrestling with that. Everywhere is a beautiful thing, but it’s a big world. Maybe someday we’ll all be tied into the waveform like it was breathing or walking. But, like she says, we have to stay alive first.”
They talked some more, trying to understand where to go. In the end, they realized they needed time. They needed other opinions. For now, they had bought time to figure it out.</Text>

Raefe stared out of the window at the snow, falling for the third straight day. The morning blizzard had eased up to a light fall as the backside of the storm circled through. They’d get a few hours of sun now before the ‘soon swirled back fresh with frozen moisture from the ocean.
He thought of the snow crew on the train ride, probably exhausted after the last three weeks of this, lying alongside a road somewhere, trying to catch a little nap before the next storm wave hit. They’d work almost around the clock for the snow ‘soon season, piling up as much money as they could. Then they’d head on to the next migrant jobs they could find. What a life!
He read a class assignment with no particular enthusiasm. He remembered a character in an old vid saying “I’m putting this town in my rear view,” and that’’s what where his classes seemed focused on. It was interesting, in an abstract sort of way. But everything was different now, and would be different tomorrow. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if the people of the past had that much to offer, why was he living through mass extinctions, endless wars around the world, corpos corrupting every government to their own ends, and the possibility of total disaster looming?
But if he flunked out of Human Potential 221, he’d be in danger of losing his scholarship. And if he lost that, he’d be out on the street, and then he’d become a snow monkey or something equally undesirable. There was always something worse, he was discovering.
He turned back to his screen, trying to focus on this rather abstruse lecture on “Cooperation versus competition in pre-electronic societies.” He listened for the third time, trying to understand what was really different about back then, trying to picture a world where you mostly had to be face to face with people to see what they really looked like and sounded like. Was there any type of person on earth he had not seen or heard on the ‘net? He tried to imagine different variables – tallest, shortest, fattest, thinnest, palest, darkest, hair, eyes –– what a motley bunch we all were. He turned up the Carnival music coming out of Rio on the Net and closed his eyes and tried to picture them. 
There was a long line of odd looking people, sambaing toward him. He danced down the line, shaking each person’s hand, asking their name and where they were from. Olaf, the Viking pirate, Norumbega, dives for pearls, on down the line he went until he came to a woman who looked nothing like anyone he had ever met.
She was more than 2 meters tall, but there was something about the way her shoulders, hips and feet formed a long, sinuous arce that was as striking as her height. At first she looked white, but then he realized she had a faint violet glow about her, as if lit from within. She had long black hair, but it too had a faint purplish tinge. And her eyes could only be called fuchsia.
“Who are you,” he asked her.
“I’m Aleron. I’m glad we are finally getting to meet, Raefe.”
“How do you know my name?”
“I became interested in you some time ago, and I’ve been learning about you.”
“What? Why would be watching me?”
“I’m going to tell you that. Let’s go sit over here.” She waved toward a small grove, with a little curved bench big enough for the both of them. There was a slight breeze that kept the trees tilting this way and that in a quiet rustle. Overhead, the sky was blue with tufty cotton clouds. The Carnival music had disappeared.
She sat across from him and laid her hands on top of his. They seemed weightless yet warm. She closed her eyes and without thinking, so did he.
A second went by and then he felt a sensation that he had never felt before, as if the two of them were passing by each other, no more like through each other, as if they each were a school of fish swimming at right angles to each other without touching. Startled, he opened his eyes. She was smiling at him.
“There, now we are more firmly linked,” she said.
“Linked to what?”
“To each other.”
He looked down. She wasn’t touching him anymore but he still had that feeling.
“You have many questions and some of the answers will be hard for you to understand or believe. So let me start with the biggest news. My name is Aleron, as I said, but I am not human. Nor am I actually here. I live on a planet my kind call A’Nonto – it means Red Flower in your language –– around a star more than 20 light years from you.”
“And you’ve travelled here to see me? Why”
“No, I have not travelled to your world. It would take many lifetimes to travel to your world. But like many other intelligent species, after thousands of years of watching the stars and trying to understand the universe, we have found ways to send signals vast distances through shortcuts in the universe. I believe in your culture, these are called wormholes. Unlike some of your more imaginative entertainment, living things, nor any other objects of any size, cannot go through wormholes. But energy – information --  can.”
“So, you’re just some kind of holo vid?”
“Not exactly. Perhaps you will take a course in your school that goes deeper into physics and it will become easier for you to understand. But the basic idea is that when the big bang happened, what was once a mass of energy, all interacting in a single waveform, flew outward and cooled and separated into the universe we see. But subtle connections remain between matter that once was connected, subtle pathways for waves to form. Your physicists call this quantum entanglement, although they are far from understanding how it works. We have learned how to travel those pathways and strengthen them, even across wormholes. So right now, my brain and your brain are having a conversation over these many light years because we are entangled with each other.”
“How did this happen? Did someone plant a chip in me?”
She smiled. “No, you have a great gift. All living things sense entanglement to some degree – we all have atoms and even smaller particles that condensed out of the primordial bang and this creates a very low level field that we mostly aren’t aware of. You and I, and many, many others, are creatures who somehow concentrate this entanglement more than our fellow beings. We are not sure why or how. But we know it’s true and have been meeting living creatures throughout the galaxy this way for thousands of years. And before us, for more than a billion years, other creatures have been doing the same.”
“I don’t know what to say. I don’t feel particularly special. I’m just a kid who gets headaches, sometimes daydreams too much, and is struggling to get through college. Sometimes I feel like I want to do something big, but I don’t think even I believe that I will, and I know no one else does. I’m one of those people other people say ‘‘nice guy, not too ambitious, a little dreamy’ about.”
“Your headaches and daydreams are a symptom of your gift, and of your inability to channel it. I will help you with that in time. As for the rest, I think you are going to do big things.”
Raefe felt like a guitar string that had been plucked and couldn’t stop vibrating. Her words were like a song playing in his head. Did she feel his thoughts in the same way?
“Yes, that’s exactly it,” she smiled. “I do feel your thoughts that way. In time, it will seem unremarkable to you and you will begin to notice that from other people in your world, too.”
“Maybe I have already. Sometimes I meet someone and I have this vague sense of a kind of static electricity between us.”
“Excellent! You are on your way.”
“To what?”
“Now I have to tell you some hard things, and ask your help.”
For the first time, he felt fear. He looked around. They were in this little woods, all alone. There were no buildings on the horizon. Where was he? Could he leave if he wanted?
“You can relax, Raefe. You are asleep. When you wake up, you will remember this, and you will be free to do whatever you want. For now, let me explain some things. Is that OK?”
“Yes, I want to hear what you have to say. Or think, or whatever it is we are doing.”
“Your scientists have made great strides in the last few generations and found many planets outside your star system, including some that they think might have life. Including, actually, my planet, but that’s a story for another day. My species discovered these things about 10,000 years ago and for many generations, we made plans to roam the galaxy to look for intelligent life. But ultimately, we realized that this is unlikely in the ordinary way. The galaxy, let alone the universe, is vast and empty. There is life everywhere, including intelligent life, but the distances are too great. Ultimately, we learned that living things have been trying for more than 3 billion years to bridge these distances.
“Like you, we had many forms of speculation about traveling faster than light, and making instant trips to other civilizations. Alas, after 3 billion years, no living things have solved that puzzle. But, like others before us, we learned more about the quantum world and learned to exploit certain phenomenon, to be able to send energy through wormholes. And then we learned to organize that energy in certain ways so that we could have useful communications with other lifeforms.
“What we discovered is that there is a loose association of advanced lifeforms called Guardians who speak to each other across these wormhole links. While life is plentiful, even intelligent life, it is sparse. And frail. Many intelligent species destroy themselves, many others are destroyed by random events, like the comet that helped destroy the dinosaurs on your world. They, by the way, might have become as intelligent as your species, so you see how it goes.
“So I am a Guardian, and I am working to nurse your species through its most dangerous epoch. You see it all around you – your species has developed great destructive power. You could wipe yourself out in a day with nuclear weapons. Right now, you are wiping yourselves out with a slower destruction of your environment. You have learned a great deal about the natural world, and can manipulate it for both productive and destructive purposes. Yet you know very little, yet, about yourselves. About how your own minds work, and how to steer them to avoid these calamities.”
“Wow, you can say that again. That’s all we seem to do – mess things up and then talk about why and how. But we never seem to change much. What can we do?””
“I can’t tell you that. Both because I don’t know – every species must find its own way – and because Guardians have discovered the hard way that accelerating your development through giving you extensive knowledge of discoveries you are millennia from reaching on your own never works. Ultimately, your knowledge of yourselves and the physical universe must develop in a new way, in a more linked way,  that you will have to find on your own.””
“And you want me to do that? Are you kidding? I never got past the basics in science. I’m more of a poet than a physicist.”
She smiled. “No, Raefe, the future of humanity is not your responsibility alone. But you already feel that you want to do something with your life, you want to find new answers, maybe even new questions. I know you have shared these thoughts with your mate, and so they must be important to you?”
“Yes, I have thought about those things. Lina and I have had some very odd experiences lately, and we met some interesting people. But I really have no plan.”
“One of those people you met was Alton Winchester. Like you, he is an entangler – I think you sensed that.”
“I did! It was weird. You know about our train trip?”
“Yes.”
“Him and that ridiculous Jefferson Davis character. I felt it from both of them.”
She considered that for a second. “I have not felt Davis. I will give that some thought. Winchester, he is not far enough along as you to contact. But he is doing good things. You should follow your instincts and meet him and talk. There are others – you will learn better to identify them, and I will also point some out to you.”
“Seems kind of creepy, like I’m putting together some kind of sleeper cell for aliens.”
“You will have to judge our motives and actions for yourself. But my goals isn’t to have you carry out some plot. These people who are entanglers, they connect with other People in different ways. They sense different parts of what ultimately will be a solution for your species. My only goal is to connect you with each other, so that you can begin that work yourself.
“Right now, there is some urgency. Your species has a good chance of self-destruction in your lifetime. Change is not simple in your world.”
“Well, I was going to visit Alton anyway, so no worries there. Can I tell him about you?”
“I would advise against it. I think you understand on a very basic level that if you discuss this with others, the issue will become your sanity, not the substance of what it is to be done. For others, the narrative will come too close to religion, and they will become passive, thinking that the Guardians will save them as some kind of gods. In billions of years, intelligent life has never found gods. If they exist, they hide well. Although we also still cannot explain some aspects of how the universe works, gods have little to do in our worldview. So you should probably think of me as a muse, a source of inspiration, that you meet in dreams.”
“Ah, so this is a dream?”
“Yes, for now, that is how we will meet. But you will remember all of it. And now, I will show you how to deal with those headaches.”
He felt a warmth, as if a tiny river of honey was flowing from one part of his head (or was it just his mind) to another. He understood that he could turn that flow on next time he felt that migraine-like headache, and it would soothe it. He smiled. This was going to be alright.</Text>

            <Text>Brave new world
November 15, 2048
Aleron had only minutes before she had to contact Raefe. If he awoke without her first preparing him, there was no telling what he might do. She knew what his first question would be, and so she searched for Salmerikon in the waveform. What had he done about Lina?
Just as she sensed Salmerikon, he walked into her quarters.
“I know you have to contact Raefe right now,” he said. “There’s a lot I need to explain to you, but it will have to wait. Just for now, tell him that Lina is alive, she’s in Efricar, and that in this timeline, they have not met.”
“But she will carry recent memories, no?” Aleron asked, “Just as he does?”
“Yes, she will understand the last year or so of her old life, similar to him.”
“He’ll be relieved. When can we talk further?”
“Just find me when you’re ready. We have much to do.”
She had a lot more to ask him, but she put all of her questions aside and let her mind drift into the wormhole interface network, which now connected to Earth in the new timeline. She had not entangled with Raefe in this timeline yet — the first time in a new timeline was always a bit tricky. She thought of his thought pattern in the same way she would remember a face in a crowd. As the complex waveform coming from Earth in the new timeline washed over her, she looked for his signature. There!
Shifting a person’s consciousness from their body in one timeline to their body in a different one was not a skill she had training in. For the infrequent occasions when the Guardians did this, specialists in Anatope’s group usually drove the process. That had not been possible after Anatope put up so many roadblocks, yet somehow it had been done. She would have to ask Salmerikon later how he had made all of this work. Now her concern was to prepare Raefe for his new life.
Fortunately, whomever had carried out the transfer had arranged to transfer Raefe’s consciousness into his new self while that new self was asleep. She could prepare him before he woke up. She found his dreaming mind and guided his thoughts to a quiet beach on Cape Cod. She assumed her familiar appearance again. 
“Mars Girl! What brings you back?” Raefe asked her in his dream state.
“Before you went to sleep, we were talking. Do you remember?”
“Hmm. I remember listening to some BrazBeat just before I went to bed. Before that…yes, I’m starting to remember. Lina was there. Something bad was happening……”
Good, she thought. He had some continuity of experience, something to keep him from being totally disoriented.
“Okay, so you do remember. Something catastrophic was about to happen — the island you were on was about to be drowned in a tidal wave.”
His eyes widened. She watched as his face became a silent movie of him trying to integrate Raefe’s experiences on Truro Island with Raefe’s experience here, in this timeline.
“Oh, shit. That wasn’t a dream, was it? You said you would move me somewhere. Where am I?”
“You tell me. When you went to bed, where were you?”
“My apartment in TechTown. How can that be?”
“I’m going to explain some things to you that are going to be hard to accept. Please let me finish and then I’ll answer all of your questions. Okay?””
“You’re scaring me, but sure, go ahead.”
“When I first made contact with you, I explained that my people can send their thoughts instantly across space through wormholes, and that they can receive other people’s thoughts the same way. We can do something else, too: we can send a person’’s consciousness across not only space, but time.”
“What does that even mean? Send your thoughts through time? To who?”
“To put it simply, we sent your thoughts to you, in another timeline.”
“So what, it’s not 2050 anymore?”
“No, we can’t send thoughts to the past or future. But we can send them to many different presents. I realize your species hasn’t discovered this yet, although some of your scientists have examined the idea.”
“Yes, and some of our habitual drug users, as well. You’re kidding me — that’s really true?”
“Yes. We exist in many universes, each different in many ways, subtle or obvious. Just as there are universes where you don’t exist. Because random events that led to your existence never happened, or because random events led to your destruction. In this case, a tidal wave on Earth in one universe caused your death there. The beach on the island where you stood with Lina, holding her hands, where you told her you loved her? This is that beach in your world. In this universe, it’s not on an island because it is still part of Cape Cod. That tidal wave never happened because the Greenland Ice Sheet still exists. And the Surtsey volcano hasn’’t erupted, because of many other events that are different in the two universes.”
“You’re telling me that there are many me’s, each slightly different?”
“Basically yes. And that the people I work with can identify and contact those versions of you. And send energy from one to the other.”
“So let me guess — you have a message from another me? He wants to know if I know where the keys to his motorbike are?”
She smiled at the joke. “No, it never occurred to the other you that any version of you would be less absent minded,” she said, glad he was trying to make light of this. “No, the message we sent to you was your consciousness. Or more properly, your memories and emotions of the last year or so. So even though I have never met you  in this timeline before, you remembered meeting Mars Girl because you did just recently meet her in your other timeline.”
“Here on Earth we have a term for people with two personalities: mentally ill. You’re telling me that a few hours ago I was a normal person, but now a version of me that was killed on some sort of catastrophic version of Earth is now living inside my head?”” 
“I don’t know what you mean by normal, but otherwise, yes. I wish we had been able to do this more slowly, and you could have been better prepared. But nature took its course and I had to save your life.”
“By driving me crazy?”
“No, by giving you a second chance. A second chance to turn your abilities from a cause of headaches and sleeplessness to a force to change your world. A second chance to build a life that you will be proud of.”
He was quiet, trying to absorb it all. The fire had gone out of him. “I can remember you telling me about these abilities in another dream. And when I awoke, I knew you were right. I don’t know if you’’ve done me a favor or not. I guess it’s done and I’ll have to learn to live with it. I’m remembering now, you telling me this would happen, before the flood. You said Lina would be here too. Is she?”
“Yes. She’s has always lived in this new world, so as with you, I was just a matter of transferring her consciousness. So Lina is here, and she also now carries the consciousness that she had in your former timeline.”
“So when I wake up, what, she’ll be lying next to me in bed and she’ll tell me about this weird dream she had?”
“No, in this timeline, you have not yet met. But she will know you, and know that you were lovers, and she will feel the need to reunite.”
“So what am I supposed to do? Post online: ‘Nice Jewish boy interested in Afro-Chinese woman from a different timeline looking for empathic mate?’”
“It’s a bit more complicated than that. Over the next few days, I will visit you and tell you what you need to know.”
***
“How did he take it?” Salmerikon asked, sinking into the chair her room made for him when he visited.
“He’s angry. We’ve disrupted his life, and he doesn’t see why. His abilities have only ever been disabilities to him. I’m counting on his memories of the flood and the refugee camp to spark a sense that he’s dodged a bullet. I talked to him about second chances. I hope he can grasp that.”
“I hope so too. I think you said the right things, though.”
“But I need to understand what the hell is going on here. There are too many secrets between us. How did you transport him to a new timeline without Anatope’s group? And what did you do with Lina?”
“I would have explained had there been time.”
“Well, there’s time now.”
“I’ve suspected for some time that Anatope has had his own agenda. Given the importance of the Earth project, I had made contingency plans. Let’s just say that in 800 years of being a Guardian, I have acquired a passing knowledge of everything we do. And friends throughout the different departments. I will tell the Council that I exercised my authority as head to carry out an emergency transport of Raefe.”
“And Lina?”
“They cannot know about Lina.”
“Why? What have you done?”
“I told you that I implanted the knowledge of Raefe and their relationship in her mind. How did you think I did that?”
The realization of what he had done broke slowly over her. She could not believe it. She would make him say it.
“How?”
“Like most intelligent life, she had latent abilities to entangle. I brought them to the surface.”
“You used your abilities to change her brain?”
“Actually, I combined with Raefe to do it. That’s why I asked you to have Raefe be with her when his mind was transported. When humans feel deeply about each other, as Raefe and Lina do, they are all but entangled. I could feel the pathways her mind uses to connect to other people. And I, in essence, trained her to feel them by showing her precisely where Raefe’s thoughts were in her mind. Time will tell how well she takes to it, but she is now a rudimentary empath and an entangler as well.”
“But you know it was wrong. It’s always been a guiding principle of the Guardians — we guide, we don’t direct. We use what evolution has given our contacts, not what we can redesign them to be.”
“I know it is illegal. And risky.”
“Yes, and you have put her at risk, not to mention the entire Earth project — and the 9 billion people on the planet — at risk. And what about me? First you lobby for me to guide Earth — why I don’t know — and then you make it unlikely that I will be allowed to continue. I’m wondering if your mind is working properly.”
 “I wanted you in charge of the Earth project because I know you’re honest and you are a true Guardian.”
“What do you mean, a true Guardian? There were dozens of other Guardians who could have taken this on. It’s only a small project — a few thousand promising latents to monitor and a handful of active entanglers, with only one sufficiently far along to actually contact.”
“I have shielded you from too much,” Salmerikon said. “I see that now. As head of the Guardian Council, I cannot share all with you. But as two people trying to do the right thing, we have to share more of what we know. And that is on me.”
She nodded, waiting to hear more.
“Not every Guardian believes in our mission,” he continued.
“You can’t really believe—”
 “Let me finish,” he said. “You weren’t on the Council when certain things happened. For example, when the first Earth project failed. Or when the 100 year assessment was made of new candidate species.”
“No, I wasn’t even a Guardian when the last assessment was done. And I was just an ambassador in training when the Earth project first began.”
“Think of how we Guardians work. We have five main pillars: Discovery, Information Analytics, Ambassadors, Administration and Timelines. Discovery finds inhabited worlds that show signs of intelligent life — gases in the atmosphere that don’’t occur naturally, broadcasts, that sort of thing. Information Analytics then monitors those worlds, building up a fuller picture and creating  a profile of what stage of development these life forms are at. They are in charge of the 100 Year Assessments, which set our agenda. At the last one, which was 80 years ago, they presented only one candidate to the Council for an Ambassador.”
“Just Earth? I guess I had never made that connection. Were there really no others?”
“There were four or five others. But several in the Council talked them down. ‘Not promising,’ ‘light years from advancement,’ and so on. And they were barely willing to continue with some of the species we had begun with from the prior assessment.”
“Okay, so Earth is the only game in town. How does that justify rigging the game?”
“This is not about Earth. Don’t you see? The very existence of the Guardian mission is being called into question. If Earth is our only project, and Earth fails, what purpose do we serve? Ask your colleagues in Information Analytics —— do they think there are more worlds to guide? Not likely.”
“Well, what if it’s true? What if we have fulfilled our mission and identified all the civilizations that both needed our help to advance and warranted our involvement to prevent them from becoming a threat? At least in this region of the galaxy?””
“I think it would be more accurate to say that we aren’t looking very hard, and we aren’t very eager to try any more. We have done nothing to expand our search area or to refine our assessments in centuries. I’ve come to believe that a growing number of Guardians, particularly on the Council, have lost sight of our purpose.  I’m going to call this issue tomorrow at the Council — I hope to reignite the fires. But I implore you not to bring up Lina. Raefe, I will take responsibility for bypassing the usual procedures. But if we acknowledge Lina’s transformation, that will become the only issue on the table and the consequences will be dire. I know I’ve lost your trust, but I hope you will come to see that I made a hard choice to preserve our work with Raefe, and with the humans, because otherwise, the odds of their survival are quite low.”
“I am deeply torn over this, Salmerikon. I want neither the affection I had for you nor the distrust I’m feeling now to decide. You will know tomorrow what my decision is about Lina. But it may take me longer to come to decide what our future holds.””
After he left, her anger faded to sadness. Their life together had been a growing joy, an adventure of the mind, body and spirit that had a bright future. Many Guardians had trouble understanding what life was like for species who had only what evolution had given them, whose lives lasted only a century or so. Such a life seemed so incomplete, fleeting, fraught with loss and unrealized dreams. Just now, she felt closer to a life of transient joy and unpredictable loss than she ever had before.

            <Synopsis>Raefe visits Alton</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 12

Raefe had been walking through the ruins of South Staten Island for two hours, trying to find the New Voodo colony. It was a hard slog. Even though it been 15 years since the Great Iceberg tidal wave had ripped through Arthur Kill and Richmond Creek, tearing Staten Island into two, the giant old landfills were still marshy and treacherous, with the occasional rusty object ready to rip your shins. It would have been nice if Lina was here. At least they could help each other if one of them was injured.
He’d taken Aleron’s advice and not told Lina about his dream. He’d been trying to figure out how to explain coming here on his own, when luck would have it, Lina had picked up a job translating for some East African officials who were touring the East coast. That saved him from lying to her, at least for now.
 He wasn’t even sure what he would do here. Aleron had said that Winchester could entangle, too. How many people could do that? Were their people who could see inside his mind? Would he get better at this, and be able to read their thoughts? The whole thing was a bit overwhelming. People often said something felt like a dream. They really had no idea!
Finally, he saw a grove in the distance. No sooner than he saw it, two men eased out from behind a boulder. One wore the yellow and black colors of the New Voodo Army. He had made it.
 &quot;Hey, we saw you walking this way, and you’ve got the black and yellow cap on. Mind if we ask your business in these parts?&quot;
 &quot;No, no problem. I'm looking for Alton Winchester. We had some email, he's expecting me.&quot;
 &quot;What you want with Alton?&quot;
 Ah, so maybe they thought he was government or one of the corporate security people.
 &quot;He invited me for the water ceremony. Just trying to learn.&quot;
 &quot;Oh yeah, you're in the right place, the man in the black and yellow cap said.  &quot;Alton, he loves to teach. I'm Hector -- that's Robert.&quot; He said it in the Haitian way.
 They walked for a while and Hector led him to a house-sized building made out of old shipping containers.
 Hector knocked and Alton came out. All smiles, he gave Raefe a bear hug.
 “Young Raefe, you are just in time. Come!”
Inside there were about 50 people, sitting on small stools in a wide circle. Alton motioned and two people  made a gap for him. Someone brought him a stool. Alton walked to the center. 
 &quot;When the great flood destroyed our community, we knew that we had angered the World. Not our community, but all of humanity had angered the World, through our disrespect for the water, for the animals, for plants that the sun brings. And so we called upon the forgotten knowledge of our ancestors, from Haiti and from Africa, to help us rebuild this world.&quot;
 &quot;Today, we dedicate ourselves to the Water, to cleanse what we have made dirty, to reclaim the water we have wasted.&quot;
 “Amen!” the circle answered.
&quot;What is the color of the water spirit?&quot;
 &quot;Blue&quot; they replied.
 &quot;Let us make the water blue.&quot;
 Two people brought up a barrel, covered with a sort of funnel filled with a honeycomb. Two more poured a barrel of brackish water. Raefe could hear the slow splash of the water as trickled to the bottom of the barrel. One side of the circle began to sing.
“We take the salt from water!”
And the other side answered.
“We make salt for our food!”
And it continued that way, while some of the children hit tambourines, imitating the slow drip of the water.
“We take the metal from the water!”
“And make tools for our work”
“We take the germs from the water!”
“And make medicines for the sick”
This went on for a while, the singers getting more creative as they went, the children adding a dance to their drumming. Finally, the two people at the barrel raised their arms and the whole room sang “Amen!” as they brought them down with a flourish. The two then lifted the funnel, now heavy with sludge, and marched out of the room.
Everyone gathered by the barrel, dipping small cups to fill them with water. Alton raised his over his head.
“Water, we have made you blue again!” And he drank the cup.
“Blue water!” everyone answered, and drank theirs. Raefe just watched, unsure of what to do.
“Go ahead, my friend,“ Alton smiled. “See what pure water really tastes like.” He handed him one of the small cups.
Raefe dipped it and brought it to his lips to drink and hesitated.
“Ah, you are worried, it seems different, odd,” Alton said.
“I can’t put my finger on it, but yeah, there’s something off.”
“Do you know what pure water smells like?” Alton asked.
“Never thought about it, no.”
“Go ahead, put your nose just above the water and inhale. What do you smell?”
Raefe sniffed. And then inhaled deeply.
“Sorry, nothing.”
Alton beamed. “Do you see now that the water you have drunk your whole life has always had some smell? Maybe it was polluted, or had too many bacteria, or chemicals to make it safe, or salt from the ocean. Yes, it was only a little of those things, but your brain expects a faint smell in water. Even primitive people know not to drink water that smells unless they have no choice. And we, my friend, have had no choice. But now we do, so drink up!”
Alton wanted to show him the rest of the settlement. There were more than a dozen other small structures, all made from shipping containers or scrap metal, or something else discarded that they had transformed into houses.
“What do you see?” Alton asked.
“Honestly, I see a typical drifter camp,” Raefe answered, hoping he hadn’t offended him.
“Exactly!” Alton said, oddly delighted. “Just what the spy sats see. Now let me show you what you didn’t see.”
They walked over to a stand of trees. Close up, Raefe could see that there was a thin band of film about 2 feet high wrapped around the larger branches about a two-thirds of the way up the tree. Thin wires from them spiraled down the tree trunk into the ground.
“These are strain gauge films,” Alton explained. “When they are compressed, the naturally generate a small current. In this case, when the tree bends in any direction from the wind, the films generate electricity. We make the film from scrap plastic in the old landfill and some of the metals and salts from the water – it will take us decades to use it up.”
They walked on to a small pit, filled with an odd kind of grayish mud.
“This pit we filled with four alternating layers of concrete and scrap plastic. We did that four times, to make it as impermeable as possible. Then we filled it with alternating layers of the salts and metals we remove from the water.”
“I get it – it’s a giant battery.”
“Yes, just so. The trees charge this up, and then we use it for our power. We don’t use a lot of power, but we get it all from the trees. We are working on ways to collect energy from the sun, too, but we haven’t yet figured out just how to do that without creating new pollution – a lot of the solar panel stuff can be toxic. But we will solve it, soon.”
They walked around for two hours, Alton showing him all the clever ways they had created a village that was cleaning up the old landfill just by existing. The honeycomb funnel was actually a reverse osmosis gadget that was built from altered plastic milk jugs. The houses were built on piles of old tires that stabilized the marsh. A small portion of the leeches and slugs that were everywhere were harvested and used for bait or animal feed or fertilizer. There was little here that came from the mainland.
Despite the breeze rippling the trees, it was hot and the marshey land lent a steady mugginess to the air. They found some shade and Alton offered Raefe a canteen full of cool water.
“I’m glad I came, Alton. I had no idea stuff like this was happening.”
“Yeah, well the vids ain’t into spreading knowledge much.”
“Authentic. How are you going to really change anything though? I mean, this is great, but there aren’t even 100 people here.”
“Now. But these people will move on, as did many before them. A few thousand people have come here before. Each of them left on a mission, to restore other damaged places like this, other people, and start more Voodo Villages.”
Raefe smiled. “What’s that about, the voodoo part?”
“You’re a college boy, right?”
“Trying to be,” he said sheepishly. “My folks probably wouldn’t be too happy knowing I’m not home studying.”
“See, right there. You got folks, they did what they could to send you to college. Most of these people, they’re wanderers. No home, their families scattered to the winds. These kids, most of them have never been to a school.”
Raefe was skeptical. “Why not?”
“You remember that snow crew on the train? How you think their kids go to school? Their parents go north in the winter, the kids who should be in middle school look after the little kids, the older kids do odd jobs and cook for the other ones. Maybe the take care of the old people, too. They used to come and go in school, when they could, but then most places, they tightened up the rules and too many absences, they toss them. So they went from little school to no school.”
“Man, that’s messed up. Why’d they do that?”
Alton eyed him. Raefe could feel his mind. Was Raefe being naïve or pretending ignorance?
“You’ve got to look at the big picture. The whole world’s playing a game of musical chairs, just waiting for the music to stop. The corpos, the pols, they got chairs with their names right on ‘em. The people who still got regular jobs, who maybe got a house, who might be able to send their kids to college – the want every advantage for them and theirs.”
Raefe felt torn. He knew there was something to what Alton was saying, but it also seemed a little over the top. He’d never heard his parents say anything about depriving other people.
“I gotta say, I was never taught that.”
“Fish never taught the water is wet, but all the same. You were taught it’s a tough world, and you have to work hard, and nobody does you any favors. But if you study, and don’t rock the boat, things will work out. How close am I?”
“Pretty close.”
“You think the people you grew up with work harder than those snow crews? You think these people here, who can turn garbage into water and energy, you think they didn’t have to study? You think if they don’t rock the boat, that college of yours will all of a sudden be full of Haitian rasta kids?”
“No, I got that. I’m not that sheltered, and even if I was, Lina would straighten me out.”
“You just were wishing some of it was true, some of it was real.”
Maybe he was. What could anyone do if everything was a lie, if it was all just bullshit?
“It is a lie,” Alton said, as if he read his mind. “It’s the lie that made the ice melt, the lie that turned California into a desert, the lie that makes white trash still living in the 20th century think it would be even better to live in the 19th century as long as they ain’t the slaves. Whatever’s true in all of that, don’t matter. It’s how we got here, to this time and this place. It’s not how we’re ever going to fix it.”
“How are you going to fix it?” Raefe wondered.
Alton laughed. “Little brother, I have no idea. I’m just doing what I can. And I know I’m not the only one. Do you really think all we can do after 2 million years of evolution is wait for the ocean to cover the world? For all the trees to die?”
Raefe wanted to tell him that it might not work out, that intelligent life had destroyed itself in many places before. But why, he thought? Alton already understood that, on some level, despite his bravado.
“How did you get into this?” Raefe asked him. He half wondered if Aleron had touched Alton, too.
“My father worked for Exxon Gulf, one of the big oil conglomerates. He was a chemical engineer. He was the first black man to become chief engineer for a major oil company. His father was the first person in his family to finish college. His ancestors were slaves. He was a very proud man. He would tell me, ‘Alton, I have a PhD and I’m the boss of hundreds of men and women, of every color, all around the world. But my great, great, however many greats, grandfather or mother, they probably were just as smart as me. Maybe smarter, since they had to survive hell with no help. So don’t you go putting on airs.’
 “In 2021, his company discovered oil in Haiti, which was a giant surprise. He went there to lead the exploration. I was just in school then. In Haiti, the multinationals had schools for their people. But still, I learned Creole from the locals. Then that cholera epidemic hit in ’28, bigger than the one after the earthquake. Bad timing, because the last half of ’28, Hurricane Heather happened. The first hurricane to stall and become a month long superstorm. The winds drove many animals out of the interior forests in Haiti, including bats. So the bat virus came to where we lived, and people were dying in droves. The airlines shut down, and the US Navy patrolled the coast, shooting any boats with people trying to escape. 
“That was when I first understood about the game of musical chairs. In the aftermath, some of the people from the oil companies got together with some of the locals and tried to rebuild. That was when I discovered that the illiterate people that we were living in the midst of were actually quite educated. They knew a lot about nature, about their own history, about how to make a community out of a group of people. But it was all oral. It was all songs and ceremonies. So while we teach the kids here to read and write, we don’t depend just on that. We’re trying to create a culture, one that can transcend all the barriers of language, religion and even class.”
Raefe could feel Alton’s sadness and anger. But he could also feel the steely determination to be better, to be smarter, to be more determined. To be better people, he felt that thought in Alton.
“Just before the New Confederate Army boarded that train, Lina and I were talking about the future. No one wants to talk about the future. ‘It’s too depressing.’’ But why are we even bothering going to college? Why would we even bother to have kids? I feel like I want to do something, but I have no clue about what.”
“I feel your heart,” Alton said. “It’s not pure, but it is true. There are so many little pockets like this everywhere, all struggling to turn the tide, to retake our future from people who only think about being on top, and never about what carnage is under their feet, and how slippery their perch is. We don’t raise our children to be wolves, and we don’t want to be ruled by them either. Hector, he has a saying: every plant can split a rock to find water or sun.”
“Nice thought.”
“Yes, but what does it mean? I know you are asking that. So are we. I think you are one of us, and you are just discovering that. I know you are not going to come live here, I know you will find other ways and other people. Maybe that is your mission, to roam the world and tell all of our stories, to let us know we are not alone.”
“Thank you for saying that, for helping me see that anything is better than nothing. I hope I can do more.”
Alton tussled his hair. “Little brother, you have so much inside you. You keep in touch.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Aleron addresses her class</Synopsis>
            <Text>Aleron stood on her balcony, looking out over the flooded canyons hundreds of meters below. Day was coming to A’Nonto. The breeze brought the first hint of warmth from Prime’s dawn to her face, and decorated the water with a dance of foam, pink in the sun’s rising red light. Higher in the sky, the Twins still shined orange against the black of space. 
She smiled, thinking of the stories the ancients had about their sky. Prime was Mother, and the Twins were First Father and Second Father. The planets were their children. They thought the Fathers were doing a mating dance with Mother, and that the children were approaching her for food.
How could she convey to her cadets what pre-enhanced beings were like? Without that understanding, they would fail in their mission, even with species that were highly scientific, if not yet enhanced. They would not understand what it was like to live entirely in the physical world. They understood emotions and myths – enhancement didn’’t obliterate that – but they wouldn’t really understand the power that either had over the civilizations they would observe and work with. And they would certainly not be capable of facing the destruction of their worlds, and guiding their contacts through new timelines.
She would share with them her experiences with Raefe. These months of first contact and nurture were often the most delicate, and for them to be able to witness and discuss would be particularly useful to them when they had to do this themselves.
Her group included eight who were A’Mopto, her species, and so were here on this world. Normally, that didn’t matter – all the cadets entangled and their physical presence was irrelevant. She was going to shake things up though. Her time with Raefe had made her realize that certain things had been lacking from their training regimen and she was going to try something new. 
Prime was full now, the sky a soothing pink, and the Twins hot orange spots in the distance. A’Nonto’s brothers,  B’Nonte and C’Noono, were in night now. Soon they would perform their complex dance across the day, the changing light powering the thermal cycle that all life on the planet lived by. Today, there would be one window of almost two hours that she thought would be just perfect for her class. This was going to be fun!
A few hours later, she dimmed the lights in her quarters and sat upright and alert. She found the wormhole interface network and felt herself join the stream. She found the thread that was her class and soon could feel the 48 other minds that were her students. All would be from the six surface dwellers among the Guardians. The three marine species and the two underground species would each train in their own clusters, at first. For all of these cadets, this would be their first experiences with extended entanglements with other species. Long experience had shown that the sensory differences between different living modalities could be too much for some rookies. Later, though, they would all experience each species’ sensorium. It was vital to developing broad empathy for other lifeforms.
She led them through very basic exercises to be able to identify each other’s consciousness, to send and receive messages. They were bright and quick and took to it at once. They were ready for the next step.
“Excellent! You have all prepared well and will have no trouble being part of this training group. But when you are done with training, and begin the long work of Guarding, you will be working with species that can only communicate in a limited way with you. More importantly, most of you will work with species that have no connection to the stream, or can’t control what little connection they have. They live in the world all of our ancestors lived in, whether that was 10,000 years ago, as the A’Mopto, my species, did, or one million years ago as you Alaxazayawa did, or only 700 years ago, as the HooHooHu did.
“And that world is one dominated by unenhanced experience of whatever original biologic senses your assigned species have. Maybe they will have some electronic or mechanical aids – mine have computers, books, videos, audios and other means –– but even those they experience through the senses.” She gave them a brief glimpse of what Raefe saw in all these media. 
“Wow!” one of the cadets exclaimed. “These forms are strangely devoid of information, yet so energetic.”
“Yes, everything is sound and color, with no appreciation for frequencies and wavelengths beyond their senses,” another thought.
“But hard to ignore,” a third added. “And impossible to turn off, at least some of it.”
 “Yes, we can feel the two most important things about these experiences,” Aleron replied. “Yes, they are unenhanced –they don’t have the data context that helps them to understand what they are experiencing. So much more than us, they must process over time – sometimes long periods – to penetrate the surface of their own experiences. Perhaps most importantly, up to 100% of the content of these documents and images are emotional. You will find that ‘impossible to turn off,’ too.”
“What emotions can they have about something they don’t understand?” asked a student.
“You are asking that because you can get to the truth about so many things in a fraction of a millisecond and then you can form feelings based on how that truth meshes with what you already know and feel. Maybe you don’t always do that, not actually, but you feel that you do. Not so for the unenhanced and unentangled. And this is one of the most important aspects of their lives you must learn to resonate with.
“Because early in every species life, neither the individual nor the species can always wait until they have learned the truth in order to act as they must to survive. So most young species develop a complex system of parallel, intertwining and recursive logic and emotion. To put it simply, ideally they act emotionally, analyze the results logically, and modify their emotions accordingly in an endless cycle. Realistically, emotions can be hard to change, truth hard to find, and yet they still must act to survive. So sometimes they act counter to their true survival needs. That is the primary cause of the failure of intelligent species to survive.”
She could feel their confusion. They had been raised exactly to mesh emotion with thought, to mesh their own perceptions with others. They could not contemplate a life without constant iteration and refinement of their own ideas, a life where blind action was frequently required.
“But today we are going to tackle something much more basic – the physicality of young species. You are all enhanced, you live a rich life full of sensor input and data augmentation. We know that we are still primarily based in physical sensation, and so we each honor that in various ways that help keep us sane and balanced. My species still consumes physical food on occasion. We give birth. You each have your own ways.
“On my world, we play games where we throw a ball and try to hit a target. Some like to do it with very little help from enhancement,” one of the cadets offered.
“Yes, that’s the kind of thing I mean. But you do it for amusement, or maybe out of sense of it being somehow healthy. I want you to consider what it’s like for those who live solely in that way – for species where throwing a rock is how they kill prey for food, for example. Until you can begin to see that,  you will have a lot of trouble establishing rapport and understanding the individuals you contact and work with. But we are going to help you fix that!
“I will tell you a bit of the story of my world, in the way that my ancestors would have told it. Learning origin stories is vital to understanding some of the deep suppositions any species have, so we’ll start with mine. And then we will perform a ritual that marks entry in the adult world for my species.
“First, there was a brood of three, a female and two males, who lived in the sky. Mother, was bigger than the other two and often bossed them around and took their food. So First Father and Second Father flew a bit away from Mother to avoid her.
“But First Father flew back to Mother and she gave birth to a female and two males as well -- A’Nonto and her two brothers,  B’Nonte and C’’Noono. When First Father flew back to Second Father to tell him the joyful news, Second Father grew jealous. The two Fathers fell to fighting and have been circling each other ever since.  They neglected their duties to bring food to Mother.
“So the younglings never grew and became bright and large, like Mother. Instead, they had to stay in Mother’s nest, forever circling around each other. Still they did grow some, and A’Nonto, in particular, became very beautiful. Mother was red and big, and B’Nonte and C’Noono were small and reddish, but of course not glowing like Mother. But A’Nonto had many colors and textures. She was covered with plants of many colors, and blue water, and brown rocks.
“One day, Second Father, still jealous of First Father’s offspring, could stand it no longer. He saw a family of comets passing by and hurled them at A’Nonto. He wanted to hurt Mother’s prize baby. The comets crashed on A’Nonto, making giant cracks in it, and filling them with the water from the melted comets. When it was all done, A’Nonto had lost much of her beautiful coat of plants.
“All the creatures on A’Nonto ran for the highest ground. They saw that all the land where they had found plants and hunted animals were under water. What remained were water-filled canyons, with steep sides and slippery precipes and small caves for them to live in.
What would they eat? Sandicar, who was young and brave, saw the silver flash of fish in the waters all around him. He dove off the cliff and caught a fish in his mouth. He climbed back up and showed it to the others. Soon, the A’Mopto became a diving and fishing species. Catching the fish wasn’t hard – the A’Mopto are fast swimmers and have strong jaws. But climbing back up the cliffs was hard and dangerous. 
“One day, Second Father disappeared – he was nowhere to be seen. Shortly thereafter, a baby was born whose skin crossed from her back to her arms. When she was old enough to dive, she jumped off the cliff and spread her arms. The air held her up –– she could fly! Second Father felt bad about what he had done and gave the A’Mopto a gift. At first, the flyers worked for the rest, but after many generations, all A’Mopto has become flyers, as we are today.
“In my culture, this is our central myth, our central story. We never have fully escaped seeing things through that lens. And we never have fully lost the desire to jump off a tall cliff and fly. In fact, to prove that, my parents named me Aleron, the same as the female who first flew.
“The species you will work with, their sense of these stories will be much stronger. So I want you to understand the power of your bodies, as they will understand and dwell in the power of theirs. Later we will do the same with emotions.
“My fellow A’Mopto cadets and I will enact the coming of age ritual of repeating the original Aleron’s first flight. We have done this ourselves when we were young, and we had to do it without using enhancement. We will repeat that today, with the exception that we will remain entangled with you. As we return, we will restore some of our enhancement, so that you can understand the speed and power of what we are doing in the usual way. But I urge you to pay most attention to the first part of the flight.
She left her quarters and met the others at the end of the hall, where there was a great ledge overlooking the water. They lined up on the ledge in the customary three ranks of three, with Aleron in the front middle, and next most senior two on her left and right. She let them see the flight path in her mind. They stood for a few seconds, letting the wind fill their extend arms. In threes they ran off the ledge, letting the air currents fill their armwings. Their minds joined with each other, so that the whole group could see what each could see. The other cadets joined with them, too. Each of the flyers absorbed their share of the other cadets, so that the cadets could feel both the individual and group sensations.
It was a beautiful day for a First Flight ceremony. Prime bathed them in warm light, the air currents coming up through the canyon walls were strong but steady. If they had looked up, they would see the Twins and one of the other planets. But their eyes were straight or down, watching the water. She let the all the cadets feel how their arms instinctively made continuous movements to keep them aloft. How occasional breezes buffeted them, sometimes triggering a squirt of fear, and then recovery. Even without enhancement, they could see far and clear as small flashes of silver marked where schools of fish swam below.
She smiled and her fellow flyers knew what was about to happen. Without warning, Aleron tucked her arms in and kicked her feet, releasing the smaller flaps of skin tucked between her three large toes. She used these small wings to guide her descent. All nine rocketed downward in formation, now moving at over 100 kilometers a second. At 20 meters above the water, she led the first rank into a steeper final dive. The second rank passed over them, and the third rank passed over the second rank.
Aleron’s rank hit the water with arms and feet together, plowing into the back of a school of fish. She felt her mouth close around a good sized fish before her legs went under the surface. The school lurched forward, only to be hit by the second rank. The third rank hit a second later. Within seconds, all nine had caught a fish large enough for one meal for one person.
They arched their backs, extend their toes, and let their momentum carry them above the surface. A kick and a surge of their arms launched them just high enough to repeat the motion in the air, and then they high enough to catch the first air currents.
They headed to a ceremonial site on the far shore of the canyon. She turned her attention to the rest of the cadets. They were a little stunned – most of them had never experienced this level of unenhanced physical activity. Only one other species could fly at all without technology. And none of the land dwellers had hunted fish, nor had any of them felt the coolness of water break your dive from 100 meters high.
They landed at the ceremonial site. Before the other cadets could reflect more, the nine each killed their fish with their teeth and handed it to another, simulating first Aleron’s bringing of food for her brood. The others ate the raw fish quickly -- her fellow A’Moptos were not themselves fond of primitive eating. But Aleron chewed slowly, letting all savor the life force in the fish meat, the subtle tastes it had, and the way it felt in her mouth.
Aleron swallowed the last little bit.
“Now, you have seen what it is like to depend on your body to eat and to battle with other life for survival. So when you meet the species you will be Guarding, remember that this battle for sustenance and life has informed their entire existence. Most of them will be much more advanced, but only recently so. These experiences will be embedded in their culture, their minds, their entire bodies. You can help them to see that they can move forward from this, but you cannot pretend yourselves nor ask them to pretend that they can ignore these experiences and impulses. You can only ask them to harness these for new survival challenges.
“And when you come to doing that, then you will fully understand the joy and beauty of guardianship. And you will be truly enhanced.”
The waveform slowly died out, leaving her with the remnants of their surprise, curiousity and gratitude. They might never experience this again. She was glad it had gone well, for now she had to get back to Raefe. She could not rush things on Earth, but she could not think in Guardian time either. They had years, not centuries.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Visit to Miami</Synopsis>
            <Text>January, 2050
They took the redeye solar train south, sleeping most of the way. Just after dawn, they arrived in Miami. The station was only blocks from the water, so they headed down to the seaport. Raefe had pictured a lone dock, but it was a madhouse of boats of all sorts. They found the power station boat and stowed their gear with the crew. 
“You want to get some breakfast?” Raefe asked.
“Definitely, but not here. It’s all generic,” Lina said. “Let’s find some local grub. I want an authentic Cubano. I told Kayam I was going to check up on his stuff down here, see if he’s been feeding me the real deal all this time.”
The water taxis were down the other end, past a long line of ferries.
“Wow, there’s one to Cuba, another to the Bahamas,” Lina noted. “Lot of people passing through here.”
“There’s another to Haiti. Spanish, English, French — take your pick,” Raefe said.
“Reminds me of Africa,” Lina smiled. “Different Asians, though — looks mostly Viet or Thai here.” 
“Yeah, that Rooster boat company sent them here after the floods,” Raefe said. “No more roads, no more cars.”
The far end of the dock was crowded with the iconic Bangkok boats — long, thin boats with big fuel cell motors mounted high up on the back, and 3-meter drive shafts angled out the back driving the propeller.
A small Asian man caught their attention with his spikey yellow hair and matching eyeglass frames. “Where you going?” he asked. “I can take you cheap.”
“Where’s the best Cubano?” Lina asked. “Can you take us there?”
“Ten bucks to South Beach Island. Great food there. My cousin, she runs best Cuban Vietnamese joint on the island. Eight bucks if you go there. Tell her Minh sent you.”
“Cuban Vietnamese — never had that,” Raefe said. “What’s good there?”
“You have pastrami bon me, best in Miami. Great Cubano. Maybe you try Viet coffee, too.”
“Deal,” Lina said. “ But can you come back for us in an hour? We’ve got to make another boat.”
“Too bad,” Minh said. “You’ll miss the best sights. You come back in the afternoon, the whole seaport will be filled with rich old people, with all of their enhanced animals. Last night, they had a dance contest for chimps. Big fun.”
“Who won?” Raefe asked.
“I heard it was a chimp named Bieber — he does some old dance called Funky Chicken. Too late for me, though — got to work at dawn.”
“Well, we’ll be back in a few days,” Lina said. “Maybe then. ”
The restaurant was only ten minutes away. Minh wasn’t kidding, the food was great. You could get good bon me in Boston, but not with stir-fried pastrami, smoked with jerked spice. The Cubano was a treat — Kayam’s version was more Cairo than Cubano and Lina was going give him a good ribbing when they went back home. 
Back at the seaport, things were in full swing now as the workday was well under way. Electric motorbikes weaved between big trucks, all carrying food, appliances, clothes and people to islands near and far. They found their way to the power station boat, an old converted dredging barge. A couple of dozen people were onboard, milling about. A middle-aged man jumped up on top of the cabin in the middle of the boat.
“Hello, I’m Bob Magnuson, project coordinator for the Miami Terrace Dynamic Tidal Power Station construction project, which means I make the coffee and pay the bills. I want to thank you all for coming. For the next three days, you will be living on small artificial island about 15 kilometers from here. The island will become actually part of the power station, but for now, it’s where you’ll bunk while we work. On behalf of the whole team, I want to thank you all for volunteering. On the way out, I’ll talk with each of you and we’ll figure out what you’re going to each do. So settle in and enjoy the ride — it’ll be about an hour from here.”
There were no deck chairs or benches, so Raefe and Lina propped their packs against the railing running around the edge of the boat. and sat down. Once the barge got under way, there was a pleasant breeze. The water was calm, the sun was shining and Raefe was looking forward to getting out in the water.
“Hey, I’m Tina, I work with Bob. You are?”
“I’m Lina, he’s Raefe.”
“Well, welcome. And thanks for coming down. Have you done this before?”
“I haven’t,” said Raefe. “I worked on a windfarm up in Vermont last year, though.”
“I was raised on the Indian Ocean,” said Lina. “I’ve never built a dam, but I’ve worked on fish farms. You go down and get the fish out of their cages, or put fry in them, or whatever needs doing.”
“Interesting,” Tina said. “You wont’ be diving much out here, though. The actual construction work is pretty trick, and we have trained construction workers working out there. You’ll mostly be helping them — passing supplies, taking away scrap, and so on. It might not seem like much, but those guys can go twice as fast because you’re helping them. And if it wasn’t for that, the project would be too expensive to get funded. So you’re making the Miami Terra Dynamic Tidal Power Station possible.”
“What exactly does all that mean — Miami Terrace, Dynamic Tidal Power?” Raefe asked.
“Miami Terrace is an ocean plateau about 15 clicks out. There’s a long reef that extends up from the bottom for many kilometers along the terrace, which is actually pretty deep. The reef died in the tidal wave in 2041. So much debris piled up on it that it choked, basically. But the good news is that it forms a very solid foundation for the DPT, the power station. We’re building what’s essentially a dam, about 30 kilometers long, pointing sort of northeast out into the ocean. When the tides go in and out, they’re different heights on either side of the dam. There’s machinery inside the dam that let’s the high side flow to the low side, and that flow powers turbines which turn generators.”
“So it’s just sitting out there in the ocean, unattached to the land? I was picturing something in a little bay, with the tide going in and out.”
“That wouldn’t work here, so no, it’s not attached to the land. We’ll be out there for three days, off the grid basically.”
“I like the sound of that,” Lina said. “My Voice never shut up the whole train ride down — bad news, bad music, cheesy and one million ads. I refused to even turn my glasses puter on — if I see one more cheesy Grandpa Mumford video, I’ll recycle breakfast.”
“No worries there,” Tina laughed. “It’s all live and in person on this rig. Hey, you look beat from the trip — catch some sleep if you can, because we start right away in about 45 minutes.”
***
The afternoon had gone well. Around 6, some of the construction workers grabbed spear fishing rigs and brought back some grouper and snapper. They were all gathered on a 2 meter-wide concrete wall about 3 meters off the water, extending hundreds of meters in both directions. Where they were, the wall passed through a turret, a circular platform about 10 meters wide and 20 meters long. This was their “island.” Poles on on the outside of the walls extended upward, supporting a kind of open-sided tent. It would protect them from sun and rain, but not wind.
 Sun, sea and work  had made them all famished. They had cooked the fish on some gas grills and practically inhaled it. Some of the team had formed a half-assed drumming circle, banging not quite in rhythm on a bunch of empty metal containers. Raefe and Lina drifted toward the other end of the turret, facing out to the open ocean.
“This was a good idea,” Raefe said. “Thanks for making me come.”
“I don’t remember making you,” Lina said.
“No, but I didn’t really want to go. My headaches often get worse in unfamiliar surroundings, and it makes me shy away from leaving the nest. But this is not only beautiful, but authentic. Is this our thing — cleaning up the mess?”
“Yeah, maybe. I mean, we’d probably both do this kind of thing on our own, don’t you think?”
“Right, cause that’s how we met. Everyone accepts that we’re stuck with the Slide, that it’s just our bad luck. But I like that we can at least undo some of it.”
“Is that how you see this?”
“I guess. Why did you want to do it?”
“Free digs for a week.”
“No saving the world for you, eh?”
“Saving the world, let me see,” Lina paused, looking out to see. “Saving the world to me means surviving and thriving. The Slide done slid all over people like me. I look for ways to fight back.”
They were lying on their backs, staring up at the night sky.
“You know what’s best about the ocean at night?” Lina asked. :Look up.”
“Wow. I’ve never seen so many stars.”
“In Efricar, my dad’s project was far from the city and it was like this every night. I miss it — the vastness of the sky, the richness of it. Long ago, everyone saw the night sky like this, before pollution and electricity. You can just imagine a couple of fishermen or shepherds sitting out like this a thousand years ago and making up stories about the stars, just to pass the time. No vids, no Voice, just their imagination.”
“I never thought of that. We can’t even start to imagine something without thinking ‘that reminds me of’ some sooty vid hyping some crap product.”
They lay on their backs for awhile watching the stars, squealing over an occasional meteorite, hoping no one saw them steal an occasional kiss or caress. Despite their best intentions, they were drifting off to sleep, exhausted from the day.
“What’s that,” Lina bolted upright. “Can you hear that?”
“Sounds like motor boats. Let’s go find the others and see what’s up.”
They ran down to the other end. The boats were louder now. There were a lot of them. Bob had some binoculars out. Tina was talking on an emergency radio. She whispered something to Bob.
“I can see the boats!” Raefe yelled. “Over there — there’s a whole fleet of those speed boats, and they’re coming this way.”
“Are we safe?” one of the volunteers yelled. “They’re not thieves or anything are they?’
“No, no,” Bob answered. He looked stunned. “Tina’s been on the radio. Something terrible has happened. Please, everyone, gather round.”
All Raefe could hear was the distant motor boats and his own breathing, which seemed too loud to him. He put his arm around Lina, waiting for Bob to continue. Everyone was here now.
“As you all know, we’ve been off the grid since leaving port this morning around 9. As it turns out, around that time, the largest remaining ice shelf in Antarctica unexpectedly fell into the sea. This is a piece of ice about kilometer thick and about the size of France.”
Several people gasped.
“What does it mean?” Raefe yelled out.
“By itself, it wouldn’t be anything good. But to make matters worse, this ice shelf was apparently holding back hundreds of miles of mainland ice on the continent. Freed of the ice dam in front of them, they are also headed for the Southern Ocean.”
Some people started sobbing.
“Some of you understand what this means. For the rest, I am very sorry to tell you. The ice shelf has spawned an enormous tidal wave, running at around 1,000 kilometers per hour, headed toward the east coast of the United States. Parts of it have already washed over eastern Brazil. The boats you hear are people from all over the Caribbean who were caught out at sea, trying to reach the mainland United States in the hope that they can get far enough inland before the tidal wave hits.”
“What’s going to happen to us?”
“In about an hour, the tidal wave will reach us. It will only be about a meter or two high. Some of it will go around the wall, some of it through the openings in it that would be handling the tidal flow. The wall will be destroyed, all though maybe small pillars of it will survive.”
“How long can we survive out here?” one of the the volunteers asked.
“I’m sorry, I don’t think I’ve made this very clear to you. Minutes after it passes us, the wave will enter shallower waters and it will pile up. By the time it reaches shore, a wall of water 50-80 meters high will hit the East Coast at hundreds of kilometers an hour. Most likely, anyone within 50 clicks of the shore will perish. But by tomorrow, a whole series of even bigger waves will likely reach this area as the main ice streams fall into the Southern Ocean. By this time tomorrow, the Atlantic ocean will have risen permanently by nearly 100 meters. We will not survive that, and even if we did, there will be no one for thousands of miles to come get us.”

            <Title>Diver contacts adno</Title>
            <Synopsis>Diver gets in touch with Adno. Long time, no see. What is she working on? What about the species that they'v rejected -- how about that brain thing?</Synopsis>
            <Text>Diver was beginning to think she was becoming an Earther. Hardly any time at all had passed since she had contacted Raefe and she was impatient to know if she had moved him at all. Gone was her “sometimes it takes centuries” perspective. She was about to find him in the waveform when she caught herself. Of course, he would have nothing to say. And he would just feel she was berating him for being slow. It was paradoxical that her species would live 10 or 20 times longer than humans, but had enhanced minds that could solve problems in a fraction of their time. No need to rub it in with him.
Frustrated, she calmed herself down and let her memories of her conversations with Flier and Raefe play back. And there it was — she had missed something. Flier seemed so sure about how intelligent species other than the humans had evolved. But why? What if the Guardians had merely clicked with those most like them, and dismissed other forms of intelligence? She ought to be able to figure that out, or at least find clues. After all, every Guardian analysis of potential member species was recorded. All she had to do was go back and read through them to see if there was a systematic bias against species whose consciousness was wired differently, who didn’t follow this brain-network model.
She found the archive interface and asked it to examine all analysis reports of non-Guardian species for indications of alternative brain architectures, or judgments that the species was intelligent but somehow flawed. The archive told her it would report back in a few hours, leaving her pacing around her quarters, unable to concentrate enough even to go for a short fly and burn off her anxieties. But finally, she felt the answers flow into her mind from the Archive AI.
She struggled to make sense of it all. She had no idea that thousands, tens of thousands, of years before any of the current living Guardians, huge surveys had been made of the galaxy. Hundreds of candidate species had been identified. But somehow, only 20 had wound up becoming Guardian members. All of that candidates had some promise — language, technology, sophisticated social organization—yet somehow they had been ruled out. She would have to dig deeper, delve into the many reports to find out why. It was a daunting task, one that might take years.
But she couldn’t let it go. She needed to start, to see if she could find any patterns that would make the task more than just a needle in a haystack exercise. She suited up for flying and headed out. There was a mountain she knew, well a large hill really, where she could be alone. The suns were cooperating. It was a day of mild updrafts and she found one and let her suit navigate her glide toward the high grounds. It took her the better part of an hour to get there. She could feel in the waveform that she was alone — no one was around for many miles.
She found a tree to perch on. Her arms folded around her, balanced finely on a big tree limb, she surveyed the lands around her. The suns were almost equally spaced around the sky, high enough to hurt the eyes, the air now a pale peach. She began her routine for serious concentration, trimming away all of the distractions, waking up certain enhancements she would need for the job.
Even when she had gone to Guardian school, she had not been exposed to the sheer quantity and variety of intelligent life they had found in their early surveys. Life had arisen in so many places. Much of it never evolved beyond simple organisms — many planets were beneficent enough that little more was needed than to float in a soupy ocean full of nutrients, warmed by the light of friendly suns. But things change — oceans become acidic or hypoxic, suns flare up, volcanoes erupt — and life either adapts or disappears. It was in these moments that simple life blindly evolved to join in colonies, to make new compounds, absorb new nutrients and change in ways that made more change possible.
That was the key thing — evolving to evolve. And that led many species to evolve in ways that freed them from the tyranny of their heredity. Once born, they used intelligence and culture to adapt further, to be able to respond more quickly than the long and blind processes of natural selection would permit. It was among these select species that consciousness flourished and differentiated. There was a myriad of ways that living creatures had found to sense their environment, to move within it, to manipulate parts of it, and to survive the worst of it. The deeper she sunk into the archive, the more lost she became in the variety of life. And yet, all life had to solve certain problems, and she was fascinated how basic that list was, no matter how different their worlds were. Hot, cold, wet, dry, light, dark — these were the sides of the boxes that life came in.
Her reverie was interrupted by a tickling at the back of her mind. Startled, she wondered what it was that approached here, in the middle of the wild. She pushed back cautiously on the tickle, felt it becoming solid yet soft, as if beckoning her to pull on it. She was suddenly afraid — out here, no one to help her, what if this was a predator? Or worse, one of Hankori’s minions? Silly, she thought, no one cares about me enough to bother. Probably one of the local birds trying to understand if I’m their cousin or something. She let herself flow into what had now become a kind of thread and flow along it, like a wire.
And then she was somewhere completely different, as if she had woken up underwater. She could see the sky through the water. The suns were her old friends, arrayed differently though. And there was a different moon in the sky.
“My old friend,” a voice said. “Do you see where I am?”
Of course, she was seeing Traveller’s Perch from Water Eye. It was Adno, her former student who had succeeded her as Guardian Ambassador for Earth. And who now lived her own semi-exile with Diver and Flier’s children, Anti and Mari. She could feel that Adno was using one of her secret channels within the waveform to evade detection. So she would want Diver to do the same.
“Sister, I do,” Diver said. “Funny that you should find me. I was thinking about some of our old conversations.”
“Well, I suspected that,” Adno said. “You are perhaps revisiting some of those old interests?”
Not exactly,” Diver said. Adno must monitor the archives, she thought. She knows I’m up to something. “I’ve had some new thoughts about some of our distant friends and that led me to wonder some things, as you seem to have discovered. Can we speak freely?”
“For a brief time,” Adno said. “What brings you to the archive?”
“I have come to realize that our friend is not only distant, but different, in some arcane ways, from all of us in the Guardians. And I’m wondering if perhaps there are many other species that are also different in similar ways. If there are actually many intelligent species we have ignored who are different in this, or even other, ways.”
She explained Flier’s theory, without mentioning him. No need to expose him.
“You are certainly right,” Adno said. “We here are in fact different. It has not occurred to the Guardian leadership that our ability to meld into a school mind creates a categorically different consciousness. Although our individual minds appear superficially to be as you describe yours, in fact they are not. They are parts of this larger whole of the school and they work in ways others in the Guardians are unfamiliar with and do not recognize. If we had not had that superficial similarity, perhaps they would have dismissed us as mere fish.”
“Do you think that your work against Hankori’s plot changed that?” Diver asked.
“I had expected it would, but no one has said or done anything to indicate that it has,” Adno said. “I admit, I find it odd.”
“Do you have any idea why that might be?” Diver wondered.
“I don’t,” Adno replied. “But I think it says something, I just don’t know what. Something about some of the assumptions that were baked into the Guardians long ago. And maybe also something about what we have become in the last 1,000 years or so.”
“Oh, interesting. What’s your thought on that?”
“Again, not fully baked. But I think of words like complacent, self-satisfied, uncurious,” Adno said.
“Well, that would be sad,” Diver said. “But I really do want to get to the bottom of this.”
“You cannot forgive our leaders for how things turned out?”
“No, I can’t, but that’s not what’s behind this, I hope,” Diver said. “No, this is about understanding our far away friend better. His species seems to be like many of these in the archives. Intelligent, promising, but ultimately, following a path that we don’t fully understand. I’d love to know how many of these rejected species fit that description.”
“That would take you a very long time,” Adno said. “Not you whole life, but certainly our friends. But I think I can help. If the school works together, we can scour the archive and answer your question in a few days.”
“That would be terrific,” Diver said. “You will let me know the answer?”
“No, I will find someone else to let you know. Your progeny. We must be careful not to be predictable, not to leave tracks, as you land dwellers like to say. I don’t know if the leadership are still watching me, but I act as if they are.”
“Understood, me as well. Always good to talk to you, Adno. May the waters be cool and swift around you.”
She flew back home, the winds now at her back. It was the first time in a long time that she felt she was on to something, something important. Ages ago, her ancestors had been able to spot potential food moving among the tall grasses from a long way off. Now, she felt her mind straining to find her prey in the thicket of the past. She would circle from above for as long as it took, waiting for that little flash, that little movement, that would tip her off. She relished the idea of Anti and Mari helping — they had never really learned the ancient hunting skills, and probably it was silly to think they should. But she could at least sharpen their thinking when it came to the kinds of challenges they would face in their futures.

            <Text>Reunion
May 4, 2049

Raefe had never experienced much dissonance between the parts of his mind he had been born with in this world and the old one during the seven months they had coexisted. Aleron’s promise that they would slowly merge appeared to be coming true. But the eight-hour long plane ride from Boston seemed to provoke a sorting of the two. Neither had ever traveled to another part of the world, nor taken a supersonic jet.
One loved the high-altitude acceleration, the boom and the quiet that followed. The other could only think of how broken down travel had been in his old world. A flight like this would have involved enormous amounts of carbon credits. If it had even been available, only a handful of people would have had the wealth to take it. Most likely, this trip would have meant a solar-assisted sailboat across the ocean, and then a hodge-podge of low-carbon land transit for someone of his means. It would have taken a month, which meant few people would ever have made the trip.
Raefe found himself fighting the idea that this world was headed that way. After all, it had been a great accomplishment only 20 years ago when supersonics had cut global travel times in half. And in another 20 years, this flight would be ultrasonic and the farthest flights would be hypersonic. Boston to Nairobi? Four hours. Boston to Sydney? Three hours tops. This was a clever world. He wanted to believe that the other Earth had merely been stupid or blind, or gripped by some dysfunctional ideology. 
The newer part of his mind assured him that everyone in the old world thought the same things in his great-grandparent’s day, when the temperatures first began to rise to dangerous levels and the predictions of global catastrophe were scoffed at by many. He stared out the window, trying to calm himself. The whole debate was giving him a headache. He’d never had one of his seizures in this world, but the other him remembered them and let it drop.
He took out his puter and read through the code he had delivered to Elise yesterday. He done everything she had asked, creating an entire second sim with completely different algorithms. At first he hadn’t cared much about what the algorithms were. At MiniWorlds, he often didn’t understand the math their clients wanted installed in their games. No matter, all he needed to understand was what were the inputs and what were they outputs. The algorithms themselves were black boxes.
But Joe Nguyen was the sort of person who wanted to explain everything to you. And little by little, Raefe had begun to see how Joe’s code tried to model parts of the world. It was a subtle and complex set of interacting rules, the answers to one rule weighting the inputs to the next, but also modifying itself. How else can we capture the effects of the individual on the group and vice versa, Joe had said. This is the math of the paradox between collaboration and competition, he had proclaimed, with some pride.
And yet Raefe had been left feeling that Nguyen had missed something. Because Nguyen, like most humans, lived with a huge imbalance between the strength of his own thoughts and feelings and those of everyone else. Raefe now lived in that gap between himself and everyone else. And it had made him much more aware. So many things influenced how he perceived other people that he had not been aware of before meeting Aleron. Things that he had once thought were his own thoughts, but were really a blend of everyone’s thoughts. What else was culture, after all?
He skimmed through the code, still not able to put his finger on what was missing. Culture was all over Joe’s code, that was not the problem. He read closer, looking to see how Joe had envisioned the workings of culture. And then he saw it. Joe had missed the most important ingredient of all.
Empathy. The simple human — well, let’s be honest, mammalian — ability to see ourselves in other people is just not here, he thought. It just doesn’t attach any power to this. Because, after all, in our society, we think of empathy as something nice people feel toward the less fortunate, when they’re relaxed and have nothing better to do. But Raefe knew that empathy was much more fundamental to life, and therefore to society. The sim would still fall short, he thought.
He fell asleep wondering what a sim that accounted for empathy on a mass scale would be like.

In Nairobi, he’d taken a taxi into the city center. From there, it was a 6 hour bus ride straight down the A3 to Garissa. He’d never been to Africa, but from vids and school, he expected to see a necklace of bustling small cities extending out from the capital, filled with low industrial parks with agritech plants. For the first hour, he felt like he’d never left Nairobi as they drove through endless neighborhoods with people packed into a random patchwork of shanties, container houses and tent cities. He guessed more people lived here, just on the eastern edge of Nairobi, then all of Boston.
But the houses thinned and then there was nothing for awhile. Flat as far as the eye could see, most of the trees had been cut down for firewood or farming long ago. An hour out of Nairobi, the air had turned hot and dry. He’d once been to Arizona and this felt like that, but less populated. Then, suddenly about 200 kilometers from Nairobi, Mwingi City rose up out of the dust like a mini Nairobi. And then it was gone and they were back to hard-baked dust with the occasional small village.
A little later, he saw another city on the horizon on the horizon and signs for Bangali City. When they got closer, he could see that the city was deserted. Some farmers were walking a flock of goats down one of the streets. A hot breeze blew dust and various dead plants and garbage through the streets, but nothing else moved.
And then they pulled into Garissam, a town like so many towns at the end of a road. His puter said Dadaab was only another two hours down the road, but his puter didn’t know that normal traffic east of Garissa had stopped a decade ago. Between Garissa and Dadaab, drought had driven even all but the smallest village farmers out. Bandit gangs had taken their place, some of whom were affiliated with remnants of the jihadi militias that had plagued the region decades ago. They made dirt bike runs to attack trucks or the market in Garissa, and then disappeared back into the scrub. All in all, a dangerous place, he thought, anxious about Lina’s safety.
At the bus station, four men with motorcycles approached him. His stomach clutched for a second and then he sensed they were friendly. One of them introduced himself as Malik in halting English and explained Lina had sent them to bring him to Dadaab. Malik gestured to the back of his bike, and Raefe hopped on. He noticed two of the men had short machine pistols slung over their their chests.
Villages remained scarce. Twice, they’d skirted a village by riding off road. He’d tried to ask why, but the noise of four dirt bikes with ancient, rusting mufflers made it impossible. He could feel something between wariness and fear in his companions’ thoughts.
It’s begun, he thought. The heat, the drought, the breakdown. It’s already happened here.
And then there was a bit of forest and the land rose gently. The forest thickened. They reached a ridge and there it was below, the remains of Dadaab, where 400,000 people had once lived. He could feel many minds below. They felt ordinary, just people going about their business, and it made him very happy.
And then there was Lina, only 100 meters away talking to some people. She must have sensed him because she turned, a huge smile on her face. He hopped off the bike, yelling his thanks to Malik as he trotted toward Lina. He grabbed her up in big bear hug. She was warm and lean and slighter than he had remembered. Gone was the riot of curls, replaced by neat rows. 
“Easy,” she thought to him. “Public affection not so great here.”
He relaxed his hug and she moved back just slightly. They stood grinning at each other.
“Come,” she said, “Let’s get you some water.”
The dining tent was empty and they sat down. He took a long sip of water. Their minds were fully engaged with each other and it felt somehow odd. And then he realized something.
“There are four of us here,” he thought to her. “The two of us who were lovers, and the two of us who have just met.”
“Lina meet Raefe,” she thought.
“Raefe meet Lina, “ he replied. “I think you’re going to like her.”
“Sitting in Union Square, talking fugee biz with Kayam, I never imagined we’d be sitting here,” she said.
“How’s the coffee?” he teased.
“What coffee?” she said. “The heat has killed off most of the lower elevation trees. The high mountain beans are too expensive for locals — it gets shipped off to Europe. Sometimes we get some from Ethiopa, but  bandits have ripped off the last two shipments.”
“Doesn’t seem right, no coffee practically in the place where coffee started.”
“No, my love,” she said. “All is not right here.”
He could feel her sadness, different than what she had felt in their old life when she thought of the Efricar Holocaust. Farther from anger, but wide and deep. He stared out from the tent. Past Dadaab, the trees were low and sparse as far as he could see, which was all the way to the horizon. There, the line between land and sky was smudged by dust. It reminded him of the beach just after sunset, when water, clouds and sky all converged in slatey blur.
“You thought it would all be jungle and mountains,” Lina laughed.
“Yes, majestic,” he grinned.
“It is the beginning of the changes that destroyed our first life,” she said. “In a generation or two, the fertile coast will be underwater. And this will be a vast desert, a young Sahara.”
“And Nowhere will be nothing?” he wondered.
“Nowhere will be everywhere,” she answered. “Millions, maybe billions, of people will be like these people. Wandering with no destination, no home.”
“Will it be like the East African Holocaust of your other childhood?”
“I don’t remember much of that. I can sense a good deal of it from you since we came to this timeline — your memories of my telling are strong. I can feel some of them, so I know what you are asking. And I don’t know. These people have so far avoided death from  Shabab, their own governments, and now even the Chinese. But when there are tens of millions of them, what will happen?”
“History says something awful,” he answered. “Can they — can we — change that?”
“I want to think we can,” she said. “I have learned a great deal from these people. They don’t wake up every day with voices all around them telling them to buy, to fight, to be better than the next. They only have each other, and a lifetime of shit has taught them to cherish that.”
“This time last year, we were living in a Bunk under the highway in Somerville. Happiness was a Cubano from Kiko and Kayam’s food trike. Six months ago, we stood at the beginning of the end. Now I’m looking at where the first people lived. And thinking about changing history. Some days, it’s all too weird.”
“I don’t imagine they signed up for this either,” Lina said, jerking her head toward the camp.
“No, you’re right. What do you think we should do?”
“I want to stay here, and be a part of this. I feel like they’re on the verge of something really different.”
He nodded. “I’ve only been here for two weeks, but I understand your attraction. And soon I’ll have to go home.”
Later that night, they walked back up the hill into the forest.
“I think it’s time we introduce new Lina to new Raefe,” Lina said, pointing to a  glade of soft ferns.
Not a stranger at all, thought Raefe a few minutes later  as they left normal conversation behind. Old memories, new thoughts, the ancient delight of warm bodies, the soft battle between rising passions and the desire to make it last forever, their occasional cries all mixed in a sweet gumbo of forest bird calls.
