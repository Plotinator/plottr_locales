I\u8217\'92m Alton Winchester, and we are the New Voodo Army. You may have heard of us. We are a spiritual army, trying to restore our home to a livable state.  We came to defend Richmond from the coal companies. They want to seize the James River, and dam it, so that they can send water back into the hellhole they have made of West Virginia. They need that water to turn that coal into chemicals they can sell. The corpos tell these boys a fairy tale about how they\u8217\'92re saving the country, but that\u8217\'92s what this is about. We got word that this train was under attack and we hurried over here.\u8221\'94}}
