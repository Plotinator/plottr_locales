Plan works. FBI raids the store. Cartel men see it happen but can't stop it. The FBI don't find any money in the safe (because Suzie already stole it), but according to the owner they weren't supposed to get a drop until later that day (owners are in on it and lied). The Cartel thinks the FBI has seized their funds.
