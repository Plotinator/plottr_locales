\f0\fs24 \cf0 Suzie immediately smelled Bobby's stench as she walked to the house. Bobby's duffel bag was open, and clothes tossed about the third bedroom. He had left a mess in the kitchen, and the toilet seat up. When I passed Ma's room, I noticed the bed was mussed up, her closet in disarray\'96\'96same in my room. In the kitchen , the food in the cabinets was shuffled about. Bobby had been busy. \
I checked my money-stash under the bed, Bobby hadn't found that. The barn was next. Misery sat untouched with the money and drugs hidden in her tires. Bobby's search had yielded nothing. \
Sitting at the kitchen table with a pad of paper and a pen, I wrote down everything I knew so far.\

\f0\i0 \cf0 Just like a farmer who assumes the weather will cooperate, the bank won't call-in the loan, and that prices will hold until picking season; I had to assume a few things too. In thinking about what I didn't know, I decided to believe: likely Ma was in that building behind the motorhome, and Bobby and the Cartel didn't know Pa was alive. The last two assumptions related to Pa were pretty likely, but the one about Ma was little more than a hope. \
The door flew open. "Where have you been?" Bobby demanded sporting a bruise the shape of Texas on his left cheek.

"I never agreed to you staying here. Take your stuff and leave," I said folding the list and stuffing it in my pocket. \
"Like hell. You're going to take me to the Cartel's stuff if its the last thing you do. I know you're lying to me about not knowing where it is." \
"Cartel boss give you that bruise?" \
"Play time's over Suzie, things are getting serious. Now tell me where it's at?" \
"
\f1\i Getting
\f0\i0  serious? It wasn't serious when they took Ma, then Bee? But now it's serious because they got to you?" I glared at him, daring him to hit me, so I could whop him. \
"Your Pa was right, you're more stubborn than Misery on a cold day." \
I flinched when he mentioned Misery. Does he know? \
"Either I return the goods, or give them your Pa, if not, I'm a dead man. And as you know, I can't exactly give them David," Bobby blathered on in true Bobby fashion. "Damn him, this Cartel gig was the best thing to happen to me in a long time. I really could have been something with them. But no, David's taken that from me too." \
Bobby didn't know Pa was alive. \
He raged on, "Oh don't worry, you'll know when I'm going to hit you." He must have mistaken my flinch as anticipation of a slug. Bobby closed his eyes and took a breath. "Listen we both want the same thing. If you really don't know where it is, let's work together and find it." \
I considered his angle. He couldn't really think the Cartel would allow him, or me for that matter, to live after they got their stuff back? He wasn't that dumb. The money could solve a lot of problems for him: gives him revenge on Pa, and gives him enough money to get the hell of out of dodge. \
"Yea, and what are 
\f1\i we
\f0\i0  going to do when 
\f1\i we
\f0\i0  find it." \
Bobby hesitated just long enough to confirm he had no intention of returning the goods to the Cartel. \
