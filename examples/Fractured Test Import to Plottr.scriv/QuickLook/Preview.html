<p class="itemTitle">&lt;$n&gt;) Cartle considers new threat</p>
<p class="itemText">Cartel realized the 1st threat was not a hoax. Bobby tells them who the people are in the note: Susan is David's (Suzie's Pa) wife, and Bee is David's daughter (Bobby goes along with the facade because he really sin't sure what's going on). They zero in on David as the one making the threats, but don't understand how they are supposed to return two people they don't have. (Major revelation to reader that the Cartel doesn't have Ma or Bee). During discussion, 2nd threat is delivered. Cartel lash out at Bobby, telling him he has to find David and stop this -- or else; and decides to put an end to this now. </p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">&lt;$n&gt;) Why go on </p>
<p class="itemText">Suzie is in utter despair. Doesn't know what to do, doesn't want to go on. She has a choice - to tell the FBI and get Pa arrested for killing Ma, which likely will hinder her chances of getting Bee freed; or should she can go after Bee and let Pa get away with murdering Ma (because he will have to leave town when FBI start hauling in the Cartel and she doesn't think the FBI will find him). At home, Suzie finds Bobby, fights (as in fist fights) with him and tells him Pa is alive, and Ma is dead - how can that be?? ***Bobby confesses that Pa wasn't dead when they put him in the truck, but that Susan said "she'd take care of that - he was as good as dead." </p>

<p class="itemText">She attempts to find Bee again, knowing her Pa might get away with murder. She sneaks back to the mine and searches for Bee with no luck. She is about to leave when she hears Bobby telling the Cartel about Pa's location. She gets an idea. *** Needs to leave message fro Aiden - that she has an idea and is on her way back. When she is leaving she runs into the guards again (the same ones that shot at her earlier) and begin to gang rape her. She gets confused. Her psyche fights with becoming Bee to shield Suzie from the rape, and staying Suzie to fight them off and continue with her plan (which causes even more dissonance because her known plan is to save Bee. Or was the plan to get her Pa all along?). If she chooses to stay Suzie, it forces her to denounce Bee. She decides to denounce Bee. *** How does she get away? Leave her for dead maybe tie her up to a cactus? after they get a call from the boss telling them to get back to the Motor home? Maybe she has the ATV again, and Aiden uses the LoJack to find her? - she never returned the keys.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>
