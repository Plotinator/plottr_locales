        <Text>The thief-taker tipped a finger to his forehead, when he strode down the path and noticed me down on my knees weeding cabbages.
‘Morning, Nate, they’re looking good.’
‘They are indeed, sir. Soon be ready for the pot.’ As soon as I closed my mouth I thought I’d gone too far. Mister Edwin Hare wasn’t as grand as the master, but he was a guest. If he reported me to Geoffrey as speaking out of turn, I’d be thrashed. Or locked in the shed overnight at the very least. I bowed my head back to my work.
‘Then the magistrate’s cook will be pleased to have them.’ he said. I squinted up and Mister Hare was grinning. ‘I’ll have to wheedle myself an invitation to dinner.’
With this he went on his way, his long shadow stretching ahead of him until he reached the house. His strong rat-a-tat brought Emily, the maid, running, and made me wish I’d  his confidence to bang on any man’s door and demand entry.
I wondered if it was his height, a good head above me, for it couldn’t have been his station, though I knew other men, almost as tall, and they quaked in the presence of gentry the same as the rest of us. I’d witnessed Hare in the tavern more than once, and his fellows listened, nodding and scratching their chins whenever he spoke. It was said his employer, Mister Perry, the coroner for Shropshire, gave him respect, and I knew, for a fact, my master did. I’d wager even King George himself would accept his good counsel.
Emily looked my way when Mister Hare went inside, then blew me a kiss, bold as you like. I didn’t return it, in case the Master or Mistress were watching from a window, I just winked, though I doubt she saw me from this distance, </Text>

        <Text>The thief-taker tipped a finger to his forehead when he noticed me crouching to cut roses.
‘Morning, Nate, they’re looking good.’
‘They are indeed, sir. Mistress Sarah asked me to gather some for the table’ As soon as I closed my mouth I thought I’d gone too far. Mister Edwin Hare wasn’t anywhere near as grand as the master, but he was a guest. If he told Mr Beaumont I’d spoken out of turn, I’d be thrashed. Or locked in the shed overnight at the very least. I bowed my head back to my work.
‘Then the magistrate’s cook will need to prepare something very special to go with them.’ he said. I squinted up and Mister Hare was grinning. ‘I’ll have to wheedle myself an invitation to dinner.’
With this he went on his way, his long shadow stretching ahead of him until he reached the house. His strong rat-a-tat brought Emily, the maid, running, and made me wish I’d  his confidence to bang on any man’s door and demand entry. All the tradesmen went round the back, but not him.
