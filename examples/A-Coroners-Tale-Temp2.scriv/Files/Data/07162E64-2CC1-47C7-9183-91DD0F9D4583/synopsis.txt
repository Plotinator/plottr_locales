It turns out that Seth is Ben’s informant. The man is in his fifties, has a serious illness, and is dying. Edwin asks why he informed on him. Seth says he’d been a friend of Ben’s father and loyal to him, though he’s never quite trusted the son. He knew nothing of the circumstances but knew Edwin had killed the brother. He’d been drinking with Ben one night and told Ben who killed his brother. He meant no harm and did not suspect Ben would do anything about it.
Edwin explains how it was a suicide. He’d disarmed Ben’s brother but then he’d run on to Edwin’s sword, ashamed of having been beaten in battle. Edwin tells Seth that Ben is dead, and they must find his killer. Seth explains that Ben’s father had many enemies due to his financial dealings so it could be someone out for revenge.
