Edwin finds Kemp and he has an alibi. Kemp says it was him watching Sarah's house. He had been told by her father she had married Geoffrey and it took little effort to find where they lived. He had been away in the Caribbean and wanted to talk to Sarah about Thomas.  Edwin demands/seeks proof of the alibi and it checks out. Edwin tells Kemp he will pass on a message to Sarah that he'd like to meet with her.
