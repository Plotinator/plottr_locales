Edwin sees Walter down by the river, directing two men to offload bales from a boat onto a cart. He seems to be keeping watch.
Edwin waits until the men and cart are gone then challenges Walter. Is he stealing from Geoffrey? Could Ben Steps have been blackmailing him as well?
Walter says Geoffrey knows about the bales being taken, in fact, it is him stealing cargo from his rivals/customers.
Walter lets it slip that his cousin's real name is not Geoffrey.
